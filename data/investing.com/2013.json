Trading volumes were thin as many investors already closed books before the end of the year, reducing liquidity in the market and increasing volatility, which helped exaggerate market moves.On Friday, ECB Governing Council member Weidmann, who also heads the German Bundesbank, said that keeping interest rates low may endanger political reforms. He added that low inflation shouldn\u2019t be used to justify loose monetary policy. \"We must take care to raise interest rates again in a timely manner should inflation pressures build,\" Weidmann said.

Kowalski, chairman and chief executive officer, said, \u201cWe are very pleased with our overall results.

Leading Dow Jones Industrial Average performers included Exxon Mobil, up 2.21%, Home Depot, up 1.37%, and American Express, up 1.11%.The Dow Jones Industrial Average's worst performers included McDonald's, down 0.66%, Microsoft, down 0.43%, and United Technologies, down 0.08%.European indices, meanwhile, finished higher.After the close of European trade, the EURO STOXX 50 rose 0.04%, France's CAC 40 rose 0.19%, while Germany's DAX 30 rose 0.21%.

During European morning trade, the EURO STOXX 50 edged down 0.06%, France\u2019s CAC 40 fell 0.22%, while Germany\u2019s DAX 30 slipped 0.19%.  Markets were jittert as concerns over the impact of the 16-day shutdown on the U.S. economic recovery fuelled expectations that the Fed would delay plans for rolling back its asset purchase program until at least the beginning of next year.Investors were eyeing U.S. data releases later in the week after the shutdown delayed the release of some key economic reports. The September nonfarm payrolls report, which had been originally scheduled for release on October 4, was due on Tuesday.  Financial stocks were broadly lower, as French lenders BNP Paribas and Societe Generale slid 0.57% and 0.91%, while Germany's Deutsche Bank tumbled 1.13%.  Among peripheral lenders, Spanish banks BBVA and Banco Santander declined 0.60% and 0.75% respectively, while Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo and Unicredit retreated 0.85% and 1.11%.  Elsewhere, German software company SAP surged 4.93% after saying third-quarter operating profit rose to EUR1.3 billion as revenue from the Hana database product climbed 79%.  Adding to gains, Actelion saw shares soar 7.20% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved the use of Opsumit once daily for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension.  In London, FTSE 100 edged up 0.09%, even as U.K. lenders tracked their European counterparts lower.  Shares in HSBC Holdings eased 0.07% and Lloyds Banking lost 0.73%, while Barclays tumbled 1.55% and the Royal Bank of Scotland plunged 3.72%.  On the upside, G4S was one of the top gainers, up 2.87%, following reports British private equity group Charterhouse Capital Partners was considering making a GBP1 billion offer for G4S's cash-solutions business.\u00a0 In the mining sector, Rio Tinto climbed 0.57% and BHP Billiton advanced 0.76%, while rivals Glencore Xstrata and Polymetal rallied 1.06% and 1.70% respectively.  In the U.S., equity markets pointed to a moderately higher open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.12% rise, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.07% gain, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.15% increase.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.11% rise, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.06% gain, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.12% increase.  No deal emerged after a 90-minute meeting between President Barack Obama and Republican leaders on Thursday, but talks continued into the night in an effort to reopen the government and avoid a possible U.S. debt default.  Republicans offered to extend the government's borrowing authority for several weeks, temporarily putting off a default, while Obama was pushing to also reopen government operations that have been closed since October 1.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew reiterated Thursday that the U.S. will reach its debt ceiling on October 17 and warned that the political crisis is starting to hurt the economy. The comments came during testimony to the Senate finance committee.  Google was expected to be in focus after the Financial Times reported late Thursday that the company funneled USD12 billion of royalty payments to Bermuda last year, a quarter more than in 2011.  Google shares were up 0.17% in pre-market trade.  In earnings news, Micron, the largest U.S. maker of memory chips reported fiscal fourth-quarter sales that exceeded market expectations. However, Wells Fargo & Co. lowered its recommendation on the stock to \"underperform\" from \"market perform\", sending shares down 2.17% in early trading.  Time Warner Cable was also likely to be active after it and Univision Communications, a media group that caters to Hispanic Americans, agreed to extend their partnership and deliver more content to Time Warner subscribers. The news sent shares in Time Warner Cable up over 6% on Thursday. Other stocks likely to remain in focus included JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, both due to report third quarter earnings before the open.  Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were higher. The EURO STOXX 50 added 0.14%, France\u2019s CAC 40 inched up 0.01%, Germany's DAX rose 0.28%, while Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.72%.  During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 1.16%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index rallied 1.48%.  Later in the day, the University of Michigan was to release preliminary data on consumer sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 10, "day": 10}

In Asian trading Thursday\u2019s Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 inched down 0.09% after the Economic and Social Research Institute said that Japan\u2019s core machinery orders were flat last month after a contraction of 2.7% in July. Analysts expected Japan\u2019s core machinery orders to rise to 2.4% last month. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose 0.24% and the Shanghai Composite nudged up 0.09%. Materials issues were among the leaders in Hong Kong, but that same sector was a laggard in Shanghai. Several global banks have raised their growth projections for China in recent days, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Nomura Holdings Inc., UBS AG, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan Chase. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.3% and continues to flirt with five-year highs even after the Australian Bureau of Statistics said the country\u2019s unemployment rate rose to 5.8% last month from 5.7% in July. Analysts expected that increase. The Statistics Bureau added that the Australian employment change fell by 10,800 in August after a July drop of 11,400. The July number was revised lower after an initial reading showed a decline of 10,200. Analysts expected an August increase of 10,000. New Zealand\u2019s NZSE 50 rose 0.13% after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand implied a rate hike could take place next year.  \"The extent and timing of the rise in policy rates will depend largely on the degree to which the momentum in the housing market and construction sector spills over into broader demand and inflation pressures,\" said RBNZ in a statement. South Korea\u2019s Kospi rose 0.23% while Singapore\u2019s Straits Times Index added 0.53%.

Those minutes will be published during Wednesday\u2019s U.S. session. In Asian trading Wednesday. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell 0.73% even after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he would quickly deploy additional stimulus measures if macroeconomic risks increase. Those risks include Japan\u2019s plan to raise a consumption tax and global economies. Kuroda indicated that the central bank has the capacity to ease policy to achieve its price target, Reuters report. The Kuroda comments come as investors are jittery about what to expect out of the Fed.

The first-quarter growth rate was revised to 3.8%.  \"As for the outlook, personal consumption is expected to continue rising moderately. But given capital investment is weaker than personal consumption, we must support a recovery in capital expenditure,\" said Japanese Economics Minister Akira Amari in a statement. In a separate report, the Bank of Japan said that Japan\u2019s Corporate Goods Price Index rose 2.2% in July after a 1.2% increase in June.

Proving that point, the U.S. dollar traded higher against most of its major rivals except for the yen. In Asian trading Monday, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell 0.97% as the yen gained steam against the greenback. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose 0.21% while the Shanghai Composite added 0.13% after the HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the services industry for July read 51.3, the same reading as June. Readings above 50 indicate expansion. The official government reading for non-manufacturing PMI in July was 54.1 compared with 53.9 in June. Property developers and consumer staples names were among the leaders Monday in China. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.2% after the Australian Bureau of Statistics said that Australian retail sales remained unchanged last month following a 0.2% increase in June. Analysts had expected Australian retail sales to rise 0.4% last month. The Reserve Bank of Australia meets Tuesday. New Zealand\u2019s NZSE 50 inched up 0.06% even after China and Russia said they halt imports of New Zealand milk powder. Shares of dairy giant Fonterra also plunged after the company confirmed it had sold contaminated whey protein to eight different buyers in China, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Saudi Arabia. Almost 90% of China\u2019s USD1.9 billion billion in milk-powder imports last year originated in New Zealand, and economists said that a prolonged ban could produce a shortage of dairy products in China, the New York Times reported.

In Asian trading Wednesday, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell 0.58%. Earlier Wednesday, official data showed Japan\u2019s trade balance was in deficit for a 12th consecutive month. Japanese exports rose 7.4% last month, but that was below the 10.3% increase analysts expected.  Exports to China rose 4.8% while exports to the U.S. surged 14.6% compared with 16.3% in May, according to the data. China and the U.S. are Japan\u2019s two largest export markets. Imports rose 11.8%, but that was below the 13.6% increase analysts expected. Japan\u2019s overall trade deficit was JPY180.8 billion. Analysts expected a deficit of JPY160.6 billion. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dropped 0.45% while the Shanghai Composite slid 0.92%. after the flash HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 47.7 for July. Last month, the HSBC PMI fell to a nine-month low of 48.2. Readings below 50 indicate contraction. The July reading is an 11-month low. The HSBC reading comes a week before the official government data. The employment index fell to 47.3 in July, the lowest level since March 2009. That index has been below 50 for four straight months. The new orders sub-index fell to its lowest level in 11 months, and stayed below 50 for a third straight month. Output declined to 10-month low and remained in contraction for a second month, according to Reuters. Despite the glum China data, Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.2%. China is Australia\u2019s largest export market. New Zealand\u2019s NZSE 50 rose 0.23% after New Zealand reported a June trade surplus of NZD414 million, far better than the NZD100 million analysts expected. NZD/USD slid on the China news as New Zealand also sends the bulk of its exports to China. Singapore\u2019s Straits Times Index inched down 0.02% while South Korea\u2019s Kospi rose 0.16%. S&P 500 futures nudged down 0.04% a day after the benchmark U.S. index fell 0.19%.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 23}

In Asian trading Monday, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell 0.11% after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party scored, as expected an easy victory in the weekend\u2019s elections that decided control of Japan\u2019s upper house of parliament. Media reports said Abe\u2019s LDP and its partner, the New Komeito party, had won at least 74 of the 121 seats up for grabs in the 242-seat upper house, according to Reuters. It marks the first time since 2007 that Japan will operate without a split parliament. Jefferies raised its year-end target on the Nikkei to 15,500, roughly 1,000 points above current levels. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng inched down 0.02% while the Shanghai Composite fell 0.14% after Chinese policymakers put a floor on lending rates there, but limits on mortgage rates will remain in place in an effort to cool real estate speculation. The Shanghai Composite is off 13% year-to-date, making it one of Asia\u2019s worst-performing major indices. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 1% after China\u2019s central bank said on Friday that it was removing the lower limit on interest rates for banks, in an effort to help lenders attract more borrowers and spur economic activity. Still, China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, is seeing slowing economic growth and that could factor in the equation for long-term bullishness for the Aussie because China is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner. New Zealand\u2019s NZSE added 0.26% while Singapore\u2019s Straits Times Index climbed 0.59%. South Korea\u2019s Kospi jumped 0.69% even after the won and South Korean bonds gained following the end of the G-20 meeting. Like Australia and New Zealand, South Korea counts China as its largest export market. S&P 500 futures rose 0.10%. The benchmark U.S. index added 0.16% last Friday to close at another record high.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 21}

Japanese markets are closed today for a national holiday. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose 0.35% while the Shanghai Composite added 0.52% after official data showed China\u2019s second-quarter GDP grew 7.5%. The country also said it will nearly double investment quotas for the qualified foreign institutional investors program to $150 billion supported market, according to Bloomberg. The GDP reading out of the world\u2019s second-largest economy appeared to be enough to boost markets and could be a sign that the Chinese economy does have a chance of reaching the government\u2019s target of 7.5% GDP growth this year. Various global banks have recently been paring estimates on China GDP growth for 2013 with some even trimming forecasts below 7%. Recently, Macquarie Group slashed its 2013 forecast for Chinese GDP growth to 6.9% from 7.5%. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.39% while New Zealand\u2019s NZSE 50 added 0.36%. Both Australia and New Zealand count China as their largest export market.  Elsewhere, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said new vehicle sales there rose 4% last month to a seasonally adjusted 97,687 in June, from 93,927 in May. The year-to-date increase is now up to 7.1%. Toyota, General Motors, Hyundai and Ford were the top-four sellers in Australia last month. South Korea\u2019s Kospi rose 0.30% after opening lower. While South Korean shares are among Asia\u2019s worst performers this year, investors there have shown an appetite for foreign stocks, having pumped $11.8 billion into foreign stocks in the first half of 2013, an almost 25.3% increase from the year earlier period. Singapore\u2019s Straits Times Index rose 0.43% while S&P 500 futures added 0.22%. The benchmark U.S. index hit a record closing high last Friday.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 14}

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.04% dip, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.14% slip, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.12% fall.  Investors trimmed back expectations that the Fed will soon start to unwind stimulus measures ahead of the central bank\u2019s June meeting minutes and a closely watched speech by Ben Bernanke later Wednesday.  Meanwhile, market sentiment found some support after weak Chinese trade data for June prompted speculation over the possibility of further monetary easing by Beijing.Official data earlier showed that Chinese exports fell unexpectedly last month, fuelling concerns over a slowdown in global demand. Imports were also lower, indicating that domestic demand was weakening.  FedEx was expected to remain in focus amid speculation that billionaire William Ackman would make a big investment in the company, sending shares up 0.29% in after-hour trade. Also in company news, Health Management Associates has reportedly attracted takeover interest from Community Health Systems and other rivals about buying the hospital operator. DirecTV and a partnership of Chernin Group and AT&T were said to have each offered about USD1 billion for online video service Hulu LLC. In the tech sector, Google was likely to be active amid reports the company's chromebooks snagged 20% to 25% of the U.S. market for laptops that cost less than USD300 in the past eight months.  Other stocks expected to be in focus included Family Dollar, Fastenal and Yum Brands, due to report second quarter earnings later in the day.  Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were lower. The EURO STOXX 50 dropped 0.57%, France\u2019s CAC 40 retreated 0.53%, Germany's DAX slid 0.33%, while Britain's FTSE 100 shed 0.32%.  During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 1.07%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index fell 0.39%.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 9}

Those remarks implied that the end of U.S. monetary easing is not as near as previously thought, which was enough to send the dollar into a tailspin. In Asian trading Thursday, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 255 inched down 0.03% as USD/JPY traded lower. Earlier Thursday, data showed Japan's core machinery orders rose 10.5% in May following an 8.8% decrease in April. The May reading easily topped economists\u2019 expectations for a 1.3% increase. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng climbed 1.94% while the Shanghai Composite added 1.35% after Bernanke said the Fed\u2019s accommodative monetary policy is needed over the near-term, quelling speculation that the central bank could begin tapering its USD85 billion-per-month easing program as soon as September. While data from the U.S. labor market, manufacturing sector, housing industry and other sectors of the economy have come in better than expected recently, Bernanke noted the U.S. unemployment rate of 7.6% may belie the job market\u2019s actual strength, indicating that last week\u2019s stronger-than-expected June jobs report did not factor into his comments. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained more than 1% after the Australian Bureau of Statistics said that employers there added 10,300 jobs last month following the loss of 700 jobs in May. The June reading easily beat economists\u2019 estimates that called for the loss of 2,500 jobs. The Bureau of Statistics added that Australia's unemployment rate rose to 5.7% from 5.6% in May. The May reading was revised from 5.5%. Analysts had expected Australian unemployment rate to rise to 5.6% last month. New Zealand\u2019s NZSE 50 inched down 0.02% while Singapore\u2019s Straits Times Index rose 1.31%. South Korea\u2019s Kospi climbed 2.14% after the Bank of Korea left interest rates in Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy unchanged at 2.5% for a second straight month. S&P 500 futures rose 0.89% a day after the benchmark U.S. index inched up 0.02%. \n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 7, "day": 10}

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.86% increase, S&P 500 futures signaled a 1.01% jump, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.92% climb.  Global stocks gained ground after Bernanke said the Fed will continue to maintain accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable future, citing low levels of inflation and the high unemployment rate.The comments came after the minutes of the central bank\u2019s June policy meeting showed that Fed policymakers remain divided over when to begin tapering its USD85 billion-a-month asset purchase program.  Around half of Fed policymakers believe the bank should start to scale back bond purchases by the end of the year, while many others believe the labor market still remains too weak.  Tech stocks were expected to be active, following reports personal-computer shipments dropped for a fifth straight quarter, marking the longest losing streak on record, as consumers continued to favor touch-screen tablets and smartphones for getting online.  Microsoft shares were still up 1.21% in pre-market trade, while Apple gained 0.69%.  Discount chain Family Dollar Stores slid 0.44% in early trading however, after surging over 7% on Wednesday thanks to strong quarterly earnings.  After the closing bell on Wednesday, Yum Brands reported a drop in June sales at restaurants in China, although the decline was not as steep as the month before. Shares were still up 0.88% in extended trading.  Nabors Industries was also likely to be in focus after the owner of the world's largest land-drilling rig fleet, up 0.07% pre-market, warned earlier in the week that its second-quarter operating profit would fall short of market expectations.  Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were higher. The EURO STOXX 50 advanced 0.80%, France\u2019s CAC 40 climbed 0.71%, Germany's DAX jumped 1.31%, while Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.67%.  During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged 2.55%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index rose 0.39%.

During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.47%, the S&P 500 index advanced 0.49%, while the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.43%.  In a report, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the U.S. economy added 195,000 jobs in June, more than the expected 165,000 increase, after 195,000 jobs were created in May.  However, the report also showed that the U.S. unemployment rate remained unchanged at 7.6% last month, disappoiting expectations for a decline to 7.5%.  The data added to speculation that the Fed may soon decide to unwind its USD85 billion-a-month bond-buying program after a report on Wednesday showed that the U.S. private sector added 188,000 jobs in June, more than expectations for an increase of 160,000. Financial stocks were broadly higher, as shares in Bank of America jumped 1.17% and JP Morgan rallied 1.29%, while Citigroup advanced 1.34%. In the auto sector, Tesla Motors surged 2.52% after saying it received sufficient orders for its new Model S sedan to double the number of electric cars in Hong Kong. The company, headed by billionaire Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, has forecast it will sell 21,000 units of the Model S this year and is preparing to begin deliveries to Europe and Asia in the second half.  Elsewhere, Onyx Pharmaceuticals was up 0.04% amid reports the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit accusing unnamed defendants of insider trading in Onyx call options before the drugmaker publicly rejected a takeover bid by Amgen and put itself up for sale. Among tech stocks, Apple saw shares edge 0.13% higher, even as downbeat numbers from rivals Samsung and HTC earlier in the day sparked concerns that the market for smartphone makers may be reaching saturation. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were lower. The EURO STOXX 50 dropped 0.85%, France\u2019s CAC 40 slid 0.39%, Germany's DAX plummeted 1.41%, while Britain's FTSE 100 shed 0.31%.

In Asian trading Monday, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 lost 0.48% despite bullish tankan manufacturing data. Earlier Monday, the Bank of Japan's tankan survey showed surprisingly positive sentiment among large manufacturers in the world\u2019s third-largest economy. The sentiment reading for large manufacturing enterprises jumped to 4 from a previous reading of -8. Economists expected readings ranging from 3 to 4. The reading applies to the second quarter and is the first positive reading in two years. Sentiment among large non-manufacturers jumped to 12 from 6 in the first quarter. The survey also showed sentiment among mid-sized manufacturers improved to -4 from -14. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was closed for a holiday while the Shanghai Composite inched up 0.10% after China\u2019s official June PMI reading came in at 50.1 compared with the expected reading of 50 and 50.8 in May. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.  However, the HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for June fell to 48.2, the lowest level since September 2012 and below the May reading of 49.2. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 1.1% following the Chinese data. China is Australia\u2019s largest exporter partner. Earlier Monday, a media report said that Macquarie, Australia\u2019s largest investment bank, could increase its earnings 1.4% for every one cent AUD/USD declines. The bank derives nearly two-thirds of its revenue from outside of Australia. New Zealand\u2019s NZSE 50 fell dropped 0.18%. That country also counts China as its largest export market. South Korea\u2019s Kospi shed 0.28% after the Korea National Statistical Office said that South Korea\u2019s trade balance fell to a seasonally adjusted 5.50 billion won in the second quarter from 5.92 billion won in the first quarter. That is still better than the decline to 5.26 billion won analysts expected. Singapore\u2019s Straits Times Index fell 0.44% while S&P 500 futures dropped 0.24%.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 30}

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.32% rise, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.33% gain, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.42% increase. On Monday, Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said the central bank was committed to continuing its bond purchase program until the U.S. unemployment rate falls further.Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher also downplayed market jitters over tapering as overdone.Global stocks had weakened after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said last week that the bank could begin slowing asset purchases by the end this year if the economy continues to pick up. Tech stocks were expected to be active, after Microsoft and Oracle announced a tie-in to garner advantage against newer, web-based cloud computing companies. Microsoft shares were up 0.22% in pre-market trade, while Oracle climbed 0.46%. Aircraft manufacturer Boeing was also likely to be in focus, after the company said it posted orders for 232 aircraft in May, up from 51 the month before, marking an 85% seasonally adjusted month-on-month surge. Among Internet-related companies, Google shares gained 0.37% after hours, as an adviser to the European Union\u2019s top court said the company can\u2019t be forced to remove material from its search engine that was legally posted on other websites.  Elsewhere, U.S. hospital operator Tenet Healthcare was slated to remain in the spotlight for the second consecutive session, after saying it will buy smaller rival Vanguard Health Systems for USD4.3 billion or USD21 per share including debt to expand into new locations. Other stocks likely to be in focus included Carnival, Lennar, Walgreen and Barnes & Noble, due to report quarterly results later in the day. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were sharply higher. The EURO STOXX 50 jumped 1.34%, France\u2019s CAC 40 surged 1.44%, Germany's DAX rallied 1.56%, while Britain's FTSE 100 advanced 0.90%.  During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 0.21%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index dropped 0.72%.

In Asian trading Monday, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell 0.21% even as USD/JPY flirted with its highest levels in two weeks. The greenback got a bid against the yen Monday after Japan\u2019s ruling political party raced to easy victory in Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly elections on Sunday. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dipped 1.48% while the Shanghai Composite plunged 2.12% after Goldman Sachs pared its estimate for China\u2019s 2013 GDP growth to 7.4% from 7.8%, citing tighter monetary policy and slack economic indicators. Just lat week China\u2019s HSBC preliminary manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index fell to 48.3 in June from 49.2 in May as new orders declined, indicating that the slowdown in manufacturing is worsening. China is Australia's largest export market. Not surprisingly, weakness in Chinese shares pressured Australian stocks. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 dropped 1.5% as weakness in financial services and materials shares weighed on stocks there. China is Australia's largest export partner. New Zealand\u2019s NZSE 50 was one of Asia-Pacific\u2019s lone bright spots, gaining 0.1%. That is something of a surprise as New Zealand also counts China as its largest trading partner. South Korea\u2019s Kospi fell 0.62% after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said Wednesday that the bank could begin slowing its USD85 billion-a-month bond purchasing program by the end of 2013 and wind it down completely by the middle of 2014 if the economy picks up as the central bank expects. South Korea, Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy, has identified the weak yen and QE tapering as the primary risks facing its economy. Singapore\u2019s Straits Times Index fell 0.63% while S&P 500 futures dropped 0.35%. The benchmark U.S. index lost nearly 2.5% last week.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 23}

During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 1.19%, the S&P 500 index plummeted 1.46%, while the Nasdaq Composite index declined 1.28%.  Stocks came under pressure after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said last Wednesday that the bank could begin tapering asset purchases by the end of 2013 if the economy continues to pick up.  Investors were also cautious after the International Monetary Fund on Friday said it would not suspend Greek funding and said Athens has until July to come up with an agreement on its bailout program.The comments came amid concerns over recent delays in the privatization plan Greece agreed to last year, which could threaten the country\u2019s performance on economic reforms needed to secure bailout funding. Apple shares tumbled 1.58% after announcing late Friday that it had changed the way senior executives, including CEO Tim Cook, will receive stock awards.  In the same sector, Oracle slipped 0.10%, after shares plunged over 9% on Friday as the tech giant missed expectations for software sales and subscriptions for a second straight quarter. Financial stocks added to losses, as Citigroup plummeted 2.86% and Bank of America plunged 2.84%, while Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan retreated 2.35% and 2.73% respectively. Citigroup was expected to announce on Monday that it will open an office in Baghdad, becoming the first U.S. bank to move into Iraq. Elsewhere, Allergan dove 5.64%, after Deutsche Bank downgraded the maker of the Botox wrinkle treatment to \"hold\" from \"buy\" and Leerink Swann LLC trimmed its recommendation to \"market perform\" from \"outperform\". On the upside, Tenet Healthcare surged 6.54% after announcing that it is acquiring Vanguard Health Systems in a deal worth nearly USD4.3 billion, including debt, in an effort to expand into new geographies. Shares in Vanguard Health skyrocketed 67.10% following the news. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were sharply lower.

In Asian trading Friday, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell 0.87% as traders wait on a speech by Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda. Kuroda is not expected to make any suprise announcements, but some traders do think it is only matter of time before BoJ makes another stimulus announcement. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng fell 1.02% while the Shanghai Composite dipped 0.55% after Thursday\u2019s spike in China\u2019s Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate, or SHIBOR, that country\u2019s equivalent of the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. That spike prompted an emergency $8.2 billion liquidity injection into the banking system by the People\u2019s Bank of China. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 Index gave up 0.2% amid speculation the Fed could taper later this year and have quantitative easing over and done with by 2014 with an eye toward an interest rate increase in 2015. HSBC said it sees AUD/USD trading down to 88 cents by June 2014. New Zealand\u2019s NZSE 50 dipped 0.77% a day after data showed that New Zealand's gross domestic product rose 0.3% in the first quarter, disappointing expectations for a 0.6% increase, after a 1.5% rise in the previous quarter.  South Korea\u2019s Kospi slid 1.52% to its lowest levels in nearly a year.

During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 1.12%, the S&P 500 index plummeted 1.25%, while the Nasdaq Composite index declined 1.15%.  The Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits last week rose by 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 354,000, a three-week high, compared to expectations for an increase of 4,000 to 340,000.  Stocks came under pressure earlier after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday said the bank could begin slowing asset purchases by the end of 2013 and wind them down completely by the middle of 2014 if the economy picks up as the central bank expects.  Sentiment was also hit after data earlier showed that China\u2019s HSBC preliminary manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index fell to a nine month low of 48.3 in June from 49.2 in May as new orders fell, indicating that the slowdown in manufacturing is worsening. Microsoft shares tumbled 1.45% amid reports the tech giant had planned to acquire Finland's Nokia, but talks broke down. Separately, Microsoft announced a major change to its Xbox One late Wednesday, saying it will no longer require an internet connection to play offline games. Adding to losses, Men\u2019s Wearhouse retreated 1.54%, after the company ousted its founder and exectutive chairman George Zimmer following repeated clashes over strategy with Chief Executive Officer, Douglas Ewert.  Elsewhere, Jabil Circuit plunged 4.09% after reporting late Wednesday a steep drop in quarterly profits. On the upside, Facebook added 0.25% as it was preparing to host a press event at its headquarters on Thursday. The social network giant was widely expected to announce a video function for its photo-sharing app, Instagram. Other stocks in focus included Oracle, scheduled to post earnings after the closing bell. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were sharply lower. The EURO STOXX 50 plummeted 2.51%, France\u2019s CAC 40 plunged 2.55%, Germany's DAX retreated 2.45%, while Britain's FTSE 100 tumbled 2.30%.  During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index sank 2.88%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index tumbled 1.74%.  Later in the day, the U.S. was to release data on existing home sales and the Philly Fed manufacturing index.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 20}

Some traders may already be looking ahead to the start of a two-day policy meeting by the Federal Reserve, which kicks of Tuesday. In Asian trading Monday, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose 1.2% after falling into a bear market last week. Japanese stocks got some relief as USD/JPY traded higher after METI said that Japanese tertiary industry activity index remained unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 0.0% in May after falling 1.3% in April. Analysts had expected Japanese tertiary industry activity index to rise 0.2% last month. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng advanced 1.06%, but the Shanghai Composite slid 0.66% after data released over the weekend showed China\u2019s electricity consumption rose 5% last month compared with a 6.8% increase in April.

On a year-over-year basis, the increase was a modest 0.2%. Passenger vehicle sales fell 1.2% while sales of sports utility vehicles fell 0.1%. Sales of other vehicles, including trucks, rose 3.5%. South Korea\u2019s Kospi inched down 0.05% after a Bank of Korea report to that nation\u2019s policymakers listed the end of quantitative easing by the Fed and the weak yen as the biggest economic challenges faced by Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy. New Zealand\u2019s NZSE 50 rose 0.23% after consumer confidence data there jumped to a three-year high. Singapore\u2019s Straits Times Index advanced 0.69% even after data showed exports fell 4.6% last month following a 1% drop in April. Economists expected a May decrease of just 0.2%.

Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng fell 0.57% while the Shanghai Composite dropped 0.36% after China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics said new home prices there rose 6% in May.

The Board also judged that the inflation outlook as currently assessed might provide some scope for further easing, should that be required to support demand,\" said RBA.

During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.99%, the S&P 500 index tumbled 1.19%, while the Nasdaq Composite index plummeted 1.29%.  At the end of its policy meeting, the BoJ refrained from implementing measures to ease volatility in the government bond market.  Meanwhile, speculation that the U.S. central bank will begin to taper its asset purchase program continued following last week\u2019s upbeat U.S. jobs data and after ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s revised its long-term outlook on the U.S. credit rating to stable from negative on Monday, citing an improving economic outlook. Texas Instruments plunged 1.91% after the company released a second quarter outlook that confirmed its PC and notebook sales are weak this quarter. In the same sector, U.S.-traded Sony shares jumped 1.24% and Microsoft tumbled 1.49% after the two companies released on Monday night the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One game consoles respectively. Sony's PS4 console was priced at USD399, undercutting the Xbox One by USD100. Adding to losses, aircraft manufacturer Boeing dropped 0.95% after the company raised its 20-year forecast for commercial jet demand by 3.8% as air traffic outstrips global economic growth and airlines refresh their fleets with USD4.8 trillion in new planes.  In the retailer sector, Lululemon Athletica dove 14.93% after announcing late Monday that its chief executive will step down. The announcement came three months after the yogawear retailer's recall of see-through pants.  Among Internet-related companies, Facebook plummeted 1.18%, even as Stifel Nicolaus raised its rating on the social networking company's stock. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were sharply lower. The EURO STOXX 50 plunged 2.18%, France\u2019s CAC 40 tumbled 1.89%, Germany's DAX retreated 1.80%, while Britain's FTSE 100 plummeted 1.72%.  During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled 1.20%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index plunged 1.45%.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 11}

In Asian trading Monday, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 jumped 3.05% after Japan revised its first-quarter GDP reading to show growth of 4.1%. The initial reading was 3.5% growth. In a separate report, the Ministry of Finance said that Japan\u2019s current account balance rose to a seasonally adjusted JPY850 billion from JPY340 billion in April. Analysts expected an increase to JPY390 billion. The Shanghai Composite was closed for a public holiday, but Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose 0.50% following the release of several important Chinese data points. After a crackdown by Chinese officials on manipulators that use currency conversions to boost export data, Chinese exports showed an increase of just 1% last month. Exports to the U.S. and European Union, China\u2019s two largest export markets, declined for a third consecutive month. Imports fell 0.3%, well below the expected 6% increase. China's consumer inflation dropped to 2.1%, below the expected reading of 2.5%, while producer prices fell 2.9%. Analysts expected PPI to drop 2.5%. Retail sales rose 12.9%, which met expectations. Fixed-asset investment and industrial production also met analysts\u2019 expectations with year-over-year gains of 20.4% and 9.2%. China\u2019s M2 money supply rose 15.8%, but that was below the expected 15.9% increase. New loans totaled 667.4 million yuan, but that missed expectations of 850 billion yuan and down from April's 792.9 billion yuan. Those data points sent the Australian dollar tumbling against its U.S. rival, but Australian markets are closed today in observance of the Queen's Birthday public holiday. New Zealand\u2019s NZSE 50 rose 0.61%, perhaps a surprise given that like Australia, New Zealand counts China as its largest trading partner.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.42% drop, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.53% decline, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.42% loss. Markets were focusing on the U.S. private sector jobs report by payroll processor ADP later Wednesday for clues on Friday\u2019s key nonfarm payrolls data.  Data on Monday showing that activity in the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted for the first time in six months in May dampened expectations that the Fed will scale back its asset purchase program later this year. Financial stocks were expected to be active, following reports JP Morgan agreed to forgive USD842 million of debt owed to it by Jefferson County, Alabama, where it took the lead in arranging risky securities deals that pushed the county into the largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy. Shares in the U.S. lender were down 0.28% in pre-market trade. Separately, Goldman Sachs accepted to lend USD500 million to Alibaba Group Holding as the company seeks USD8 billion of loans. Insurance companies were also likely to be in focus, as American International Group Chief Executive Officer Robert Benmosche raised doubt about whether the company will complete a sale of its plane-leasing unit to a Chinese investor group by a deadline this month.  Elsewhere, Salesforce.com shares surged 2.45% in early trading after saying it will pay USD2.5 billion for marketing software maker ExactTarget. Other stocks in focus included Brown-Forman and Hovnanian, due to report first quarter earnings before the start of U.S. trade. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were lower. The EURO STOXX 50 dropped 0.55%, France\u2019s CAC 40 retreated 0.61%, Germany's DAX slid 0.42%, while Britain's FTSE 100 tumbled 0.96%.  During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index retreated 0.97%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index dove 3.83%.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 6, "day": 4}

The previous month\u2019s figure was revised down to a gain of 113,000 from a previously reported increase of 119,000.The data fuelled uncertainty over whether the Federal Reserve will scale back its asset purchase program this year.  Financial stocks were broadly lower, as shares in Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan slid 0.27% and 0.28%, while Citigroup and Bank of America fell 0.20% and 0.15% respectively.

During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.36%, the S&P 500 index retreated 0.54%, while the Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.50%.  Official data showed that U.S. core durable goods orders rose 1.3% in April, beating expectations for a 0.5% increase, after a 1.7% decline the previous month.  Durable goods orders, including transportation items, rose 3.3% last month, more than the expected 1.5% increase, after a 5.9% fall in March.  The data came after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday that the bank could begin tapering its bond-buying program.  In testimony to the U.S. Joint Economic Committee, Fed Chairman Bernanke said a decision to scale back the Fed\u2019s asset purchase program could be taken in the \"next few meetings\" if economic data continued to improve.  In company news, consumer products maker Procter & Gamble was said to be replacing Chief Executive Officer Bob McDonald with his predecessor, A.G. Lafley, sending shares up 4.24%.  On the downside, Hewlett-Packard slid 0.88% after the stock soared over 17% on Thursday, a day after the world's largest PC maker raised its 2013 earnings outlook following quarterly results that beat expectations. Also in earnings news, retailer Abercrombie & Fitch reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss and said full-year forecast also fell short of estimates, sending shares down 10.50%. Among Internet-related companies, Google declined 0.72% amid reports the maker of the Android operating system is considering buying map-software provider Waze Inc., possibly leading to a bidding war with Facebook. Separately, Salesforce.com plunged 5.10% after the business software producer matched market estimates for first-quarter earnings. However, the company issued a disappointing forecast for the current quarter. Financial stocks added to losses, as Citigroup slipped 0.16% and Goldman Sachs fell 0.21%, while JP Morgan declined 0.28%. Other stocks in focus includedFootlocker, scheduled to report first-quarter earnings after the closing bell. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were lower. The EURO STOXX 50 dropped 0.54%, France\u2019s CAC 40 edged down 0.17%, Germany's DAX slid 0.68%, while Britain's FTSE 100 declined 0.65%.  During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slipped 0.23%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index climbed 0.58%. \n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 24}

Barring a reversal, Asian stocks could be headed for the fifth consecutive losing day. In Asian trading Monday, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 plunged 3.11% after minutes from the Bank of Japan\u2019s April meeting indicated some members of the central bank opposed the goal of 2% inflation within two years. The BoJ minutes show members are concerned about the rise in bond yields caused by the central bank\u2019s ultra-loose monetary stimulus efforts. Former economists Takahide Kiuchi and Takehiro Sato were among the members that expressed concern that targeting 2% inflation within two years was too much of a burden for an economy wracked by deflation dating back to at least the late 1990s. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng inched up 0.07% while the Shanghai Composite rose 0.11% after the National Bureau of Statistics said profits at Chinese industrial firms rose 11.4% through the first four months of this year. Last Thursday, China\u2019s HSBC Flash Purchasing Managers Index, the earliest indicator of the country's industrial activity, fell to a seven-month low of 49.6 in May from a final reading of 50.4 in April. S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.70% Barclays advised shorting the Aussie against the Canadian and New Zealand dollars. Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission show that short bets on the Aussie jumped to 32,409 contracts on May 21, up from 13,450 contracts a week earlier. New Zealand\u2019s NZSE 50 slid 1.12%. South Korea\u2019s Kospi rose 0.36% after the Bank of Korea said consumer confidence there jumped to 104 to 102 last month. Analysts expected a reading of 103. Singapore\u2019s Straits Times Index inched up 0.11%. S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.07%, but markets in the U.S. and U.K. are closed Monday for public holidays.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 26}

In Asian trading Friday, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose 0.68%, touching its highest levels since late 2007 after USD/JPY traded slightly higher. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng plunged 1.7% while the Shanghai Composite dropped 0.66% after HSBC said its flash reading of China\u2019s Purchasing Managers' Index for May fell to 49.6. HSBC\u2019s April PMI reading was 50.4. Readings below 50 indicate contraction and the May flash reading is the first time since October that China has slipped below the 50 level. The new orders index fell to 49.5, the worst reading since last September. China\u2019s official PMI data will be released next week. Following a tepid batch of Chinese economic data points last month, some analysts pared their 2013 GDP growth forecasts for the world\u2019s second-largest economy to 7.5% from 8%. That data point weighed on Australian equities because China is that country\u2019s largest trading partner. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 dipped 1.7%. Australian stocks also came under pressure after Ford Australia said it will shutter its Broadmeadows and Geelong plants in October 2016, leading to the loss of 1,200 jobs in the process. Although the Aussie has been sliding recently, it is still strong against the greenback by historical standards and that strength may have prompted the glum news from Ford. The company said its manufacturing costs in Australia are double that of its costs in Europe and nearly quadruple its costs in Asia. New Zealand\u2019s NZSE 50 fell 0.14%. China is also New Zealand\u2019s largest trading partner. South Korea\u2019s Kospi slid 0.64%. Singapore\u2019s Straits Times Index lost 0.47% after Statistics Singapore said that Singaporean GDP fell 0.2% in the first quarter following a 1.5% fourth-quarter increase. Analysts expected a first-quarter increase of 0.5%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.12% a day after the benchmark U.S. index settled lower by 0.83%.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 5, "day": 22}

In pre-market trade, JP Morgan tumbled 1.83%, while Bank of America shares plunged 2.78%. Tech stocks were also likely to be in focus, as Hewlett-Packard said earnings excluding some items will be in the range of 84 cents to 87 cents a share in the three months through July, above analysts' estimates. The news sent the maker of personal computers's shares soaring 11.63% in early trading. Among retailers, PetSmart rallied 2.37% in extended trading, after the retailer said late Wednesday that it predicted higher full-year earnings than initially forecast in March.  Elsewhere, Bristol-Myers Squibb added 0.32% pre-market after a Citigroup note highlighted excitement surrounding so-called immunotherapy, in the wake of positive results from clinical trials conducted by companies such as Bristol-Myers and Roche Holding.

Also Thursday, the preliminary reading of China\u2019s HSBC manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 49.6 in May, below the 50 level that separates contraction from growth down from a final reading of 50.4 in April.

That is the biggest drop since December 2011 and the first time since October 2012 the figure has fallen below 100. Readings below 100 indicate more consumers are pensive than are feeling optimistic.

During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.15%, the S&P 500 index rose 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite index edged 0.18% higher. On Thursday, John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said the Fed could begin reducing its monetary easing this summer and end bond buying late this year. Fresh concerns over the outlook for growth in the U.S. were sparked by a recent string of disappointing economic data. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said on Thursday that its manufacturing index fell to minus 5.2 in May from April\u2019s reading of 1.3, while the Department of Labor said the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. rose to a seasonally adjusted 360,000 last week, compared to expectations for an increase to 330,000.  Networking equipment company Cisco Systems added 0.07%, after surging over 12% on Thursday as it reported fiscal third-quarter profit that topped estimates.  Also in the tech sector, Dell edged down 0.15% after reporting a steep drop in quarterly profit after the closing bell as personal computer sales continued to shrink. Adding to losses, Applied Materials retreated 0.68%, as the largest producer of chipmaking equipment forecast fiscal third-quarter profit and sales that may fall short of some analysts\u2019 estimates.  Among retailers, J.C. Penney plunged 5.32% after saying late Thursday that operating margins plunged in the first quarter while total sales and same-store sales registered double-digit declines.  Elsewhere, financial stocks were broadly higher, as shares in Goldman Sachs climbed 0.51% and Bank of America advanced 0.45%, while Citigroup and JP Morgan gained 0.55% and 0.61% respectively. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were higher. The EURO STOXX 50 added 0.17%, France\u2019s CAC 40 advanced 0.40%, Germany's DAX edged up 0.04%, while Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.30%.  During the Asian trading session, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index retreated 0.39%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index remained closed for a national holiday.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.31% gain, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.26% rise, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.37% increase.  Investor confidence weakened on Wednesday after data showed that U.S. durable goods orders dropped 5.7% in March, much worse than expectations for a decline of 2.8%. Core durable goods orders, which exclude transportation items, fell 1.4%, compared to expectations for a 0.5% increase. But stocks remained globally supported after disappointing German economic data earlier in the week fuelled expectations over a possible rate cut by the ECB. Tech stocks were expected to remain active, after chipmaker LSI Corp reported quarterly results above analysts' estimates and forecast current-quarter revenue largely above expectation, sending shares up 1.57% in pre-market trade. Separately, hard disk drive maker Western Digital soared 3.97% in late trading, after forecasting current-quarter revenue largely above analysts' expectations.  On the downside, Citrix Systems saw shares plummet 11.27% after hours, as the cloud computing software maker forecast a lower-than-expected profit for the current quarter as its customers reduce IT spending and delay orders.  U.S. life insurer Aflac was also likely to be in focus after it reported a better-than-expected 13% rise in quarterly profit.  In company news, Verizon Communications was slated to move amid reports the company hired advisers to prepare a possible USD100 billion cash and stock bid to take full control of Verizon Wireless from joint venture partner Vodafone Group. Verizon shares were down 0.29% in extended trading. Other stocks in focus included Bristol-Myers Squibb, Exxon Mobil, UPS, Colgate-Palmolive, Dow Chemical, NY Times, Harley-Davidson, Southwest Air and United Continental, as well as 3M, all due to report earnings later in the day. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were mixed to lower. The EURO STOXX 50 retreated 0.45%, France\u2019s CAC 40 slid 0.30%, Germany's DAX added 0.11%, while Britain's FTSE 100 edged down 0.14%.  During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 0.98%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index gained 0.6%.  Later in the day, the U.S. was to produce the weekly government report on initial jobless claims.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 4, "day": 24}

Core durable goods orders, which exclude transportation items, fell 1.4% in March, compared to expectations for a 0.5% increase.  Stocks found support earlier, amid mounting speculation over a rate cut by the ECB after a report showed that the Ifo index of German business climate fell to a four month low of 104.4 in April from 106.7 in March.The data came one day after a report showed that Germany\u2019s manufacturing and service sectors contracted in April.  Apple saw shares plummet 2.74% after the tech giant on Tuesday bowed to investors' demands to share more of its USD145 billion cash pile. The iPhone maker also posted its first quarterly profit decline in more than a decade after market close. Shares were still up 0.19% in pre-market trade. AT&T shares dove 4.79% after the company reported a net loss of cellphone subscribers in the first quarter. Adding to losses, OPKO Health slipped 0.14% after announcing the acquisition of Israel-based biopharmaceutical company Prolor Biotech in an all-stock deal valued at USD480 million to expand its portfolio of specialty drugs. On the upside, Virgin Media gained 0.49% after the cable operator reported a 54% rise in first quarter free cash flow and announced a series of major business deals. Elsewhere, Yum Brands saw shares surge 6.84% after reporting late Tuesday that quarterly profit fell less than market expectations, despite a sharp drop in sales in its top China market.

Texas Instruments was also up pre-market, climbing 0.52%, after saying that first-quarter earnings and revenue slightly exceeded expectations as demand for its chips improved.

Meanwhile, investors remained focused on the yen, which weakened across the board after the Group of 20 nations said Japan's recent policy actions are aimed at beating deflation and not at competitively weakening the yen. Auto stocks were expected to be active, following reports General Motors is planning to add four new plants in the next three years in China to bring its production capacity to 5 million vehicles a year. Aircraft manufacturer Boeing is also likely to be in focus, as the company has started installing reinforced lithium ion batteries on five grounded 787 jets, in the hope that the first commercial Dreamliners will be ready to fly again in a week's time. In the tech sector, Dutch company Royal Philips Electronics reported first-quarter profit that missed analysts\u2019 estimates on declining sales at its lighting and health-care businesses, sending shares down 3.67% in pre-market trade. Separately, Blackstone Group reportedly pulled out on Friday of bidding for Dell amid concerns about a worsening global PC slump.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.59% increase, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.69% advance, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.64% gain.  Investors remained cautious as Thursday's downbeat U.S. economic reports added to concerns over the outlook for global growth.  The Philly Fed manufacturing index fell to 1.3 in April from 2.0 last month, compared to expectations for a reading of 3.0, while the Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits last week rose to a seasonally adjusted 352,000, compared to expectations for an increase to 350,000. Tech stocks were expected to be active, after IBM posted a quarterly earnings miss as the company struggled with the depreciation of the yen, sending shares down 4.47% in pre-market trade. Google shares rallied 1.34% in early trading, as the group's net revenue grew 23% in the first quarter, easing the effect of a sharp decline in its Motorola mobile phone division. Separately, a federal judge reportedly threw out Viacom's lawsuit accusing Google of posting its programs on YouTube without permission, a year after a federal appeals court had revived the landmark copyright infringement case. In addition, Microsoft surged 2.64% pre-market after CEO Peter Klein said he is leaving at the end of June, as the software company struggles with declining personal computer sales. In M&A news, J.C. Penney Co was reportedly speaking with Wells Fargo about a new loan to help it buttress its cash reserves. Shares in the retailer climbed 0.53% in after-hour trade.

Among earnings, General Electric plummeted 3.66% after the company reported results that beat estimates, but said weakness in the company's European operations dimmed optimism. Adding to losses, McDonald's tumbled 1.80% after the fast-food chain missed earnings expectations by a penny and said global comparable sales were down 1% for the quarter. In the tech sector, IBM plunged 6.25% after posting a quarterly earnings miss. The company added that it will accelerate the pace of job cuts after sales of software and mainframe computers slowed. In the financial sector, stocks were mostly lower. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America both dipped 0.01%, while Citigroup slipped 0.11%. JP Morgan overperformed on the other hand, adding 0.21%. Pharmaceuticals were also in focus, as GlaxoSmithKline was accused of market abuse by the U.K.'s Office of Fair Trading, alleging that Glaxo paid generic firms to delay launching cheap copies of its top-selling anti-depressant Seroxat. Nonetheless, shares in the company were up 0.18% at the open of the U.S. trading session. Vertex Pharmaceuticals was also on the upside, soaring 56.97% after the drugmaker reported a successful trial for its experimental cystic fibrosis drug.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.46% loss, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.56% decline, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.60% drop. On Tuesday, the IMF cut its 2013 forecast for global growth to 3.3%, down from its January projection of 3.5%. It also trimmed its 2014 forecast to 4.0% from 4.1%.  Sentiment remained mildly supported however, after data showed that U.S. industrial production and housing starts rose at a faster-than-forecast pace in March, easing concerns that the U.S. economic recovery is losing traction.  Airline companies were likely to be in focus, as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday examined whether to allow Boeing's 787 Dreamliner to resume long-distance, trans-ocean flights as part of its review of a revamped battery system. Consumer goods stocks were also expected to be active, amid reports Procter & Gamble plans to increase the time it takes to pay its suppliers by as much as 30 days, which could free up to USD2 billion in cash. Separately, a jury in Chicago rejected claims on Tuesday that the orthopedics unit of Johnson & Johnson inappropriately marketed an artificial hip recalled by the company in 2010.  In the auto sector, Ford shares edged down 0.08% in pre-market trade, as the company's European car registrations fell 15.9% in March, according to data published by the Association of European Carmakers.  Elsewhere, Tesco, Britain's biggest retailer, said it will exit its loss-making U.S. business, taking a USD1.5 billion write-off that caused its annual profit to fall for the first time in 20 years.

Financial stocks were broadly lower, as shares in JP Morgan retreated 0.95% and Goldman Sachs tumbled 1.74%, while Citigroup and Bank of America plummeted 1.80% and 3.75% respectively. Earlier in the day, Bank of America and Bank of New York Mellon, down 1.48%, posted results that that fell short of expectations. Adding to losses, Intel declined 1.14% after the chipmaker missed earnings estimates by a penny and said it expects a current-quarter revenue decline of as much as eight% due to a drop in PC sales. Elsewhere, aicraft manufacturer Boeing lost 1.16%, after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday examined whether to allow the 787 Dreamliner to resume long-distance, trans-ocean flights as part of its review of a revamped battery system.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.33% increase, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.32% rise, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.32% gain.  Investors remained cautious after weaker-than-expected first quarter growth numbers from China earlier in the week, along with recent disappointing U.S. data underlined fears over the outlook for global growth.On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund said continued monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan was expected to continue to support growth in the U.S. and Japan, while the euro zone still posed the greatest threat to a recovery in the global economy.Tech stocks were expected to be active, after a key Apple supplier, chipmaker Cirrus Logic , gave a disappointing revenue forecast on Wednesday, fueling worries about weakening demand for the iPhone and iPad. Shares in the tech giant were up 0.30% in pre-market trade. Among earnings, American Express, the biggest U.S. credit-card issuer by customer spending, reported late Wednesday a first-quarter profit that exceeded analysts' estimates as consumers boosted purchases. EBay plummeted 2.35% pre-market, after reporting first-quarter revenue that missed estimates and forecast disappointing sales and profit for the current period, as weakness in Europe weighs on growth at its PayPal unit. In the financial sector, Bank of America's revenue from fixed-income trading reportedly declined the most among peers in the first quarter, eroding the biggest profit source of the firm\u2019s Merrill Lynch investment bank.

During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.47%, the S&P 500 index shed 0.63%, while the Nasdaq Composite index declined 0.53%.  In the U.S., data showed that the Empire State manufacturing index fell to 3.1 in April, from a reading of 9.2 the previous month, compared to expectations for a decline to 7.0. Market sentiment weakened earlier, as official data showed that the Chinese economy expanded by 7.7% year-on-year in the three months to March, down from 7.9% in the fourth quarter and undershooting expectations for 8.0% growth.Separate reports showed that Chinese industrial production also came in below expectations, while retail sales rose slightly more than forecast.The data reinforced concerns over the outlook for global growth after data on Friday showed that U.S. retail sales fell 0.4% in March, the largest decline in nine months. Commodity-linked stocks were broadly weighed by global growth worries. Shares in Exxon Mobil tumbled 0.98% and Chevron plummeted 1.52%, while Iamgold and Kinross dove 10.92% and 9.18% respectively, as gold prices dropped. In the auto sector, General Motors declined 0.71% and Ford Motor retreated 1.42%, after the two largest U.S. automakers agreed to jointly develop a new line of nine- and 10-speed automatic transmissions. On the upside, Thermo Fisher Scientific surged 4.47% amid reports it was nearing a deal to buy genetic testing equipment maker Life Technologies for close to USD13 billion, marking what would be one of the year's biggest corporate takeovers. The news sent shares in Life Technologies up 7.79% at the open of the U.S. trading session. Financial stocks added to gains, as shares in JP Morgan added 0.10% and Goldman Sachs advanced 0.66%, while Bank of America and Citigroup jumped 0.74% and 2.32% respectively. Earlier in the day, Citigroup topped earnings and revenue expectations, thanks to improvements on loans and credit spreads. Elsewhere, Sprint Nextel soared 16.24% after Dish Network offered to acquire the company for USD25.5 billion in cash and stock. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were lower. The EURO STOXX 50 declined 0.45%, France\u2019s CAC 40 retreated 0.67%, Germany's DAX dropped 0.52%, while Britain's FTSE 100 lost 0.84%.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.10% rise, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.04% gain, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.14% fall.Market sentiment has been supported since the BoJ unveiled a massive monetary stimulus program last week, aimed at beating deflation in the world\u2019s third largest economy.Meanwhile, Wednesday\u2019s minutes of the Federal Reserve\u2019s March meeting, which were inadvertently released ahead of schedule, showed that that a few policymakers saw quantitative easing tapering around midyear, while several others believed it would be appropriate to slow later in the year and to stop by the end of the year.The impact of the minutes was muted as the meeting was held before nonfarm payrolls data showed that the U.S. economy added far fewer than expected jobs in March. Retailers were expected to be active, after Yum Brands said in a filing Wednesday that the latest deadly avian flu outbreak would have a \"significant, negative impact\" on sales at KFC stores in China in April, sending shares down 1.14% in pre-market trade. In addition, Costco Wholesale reported a 4% rise in March sales at stores open at least a year, missing market expectations, due to lower fuel prices and a strong dollar, which hurt the value of its sales overseas.  Energy-linked stocks were also likely to be in focus, after Chesapeake Energy won the dismissal of a securities class action lawsuit over allegations the company misled investors about its financial condition. Separately, Chevron slipped 0.27% in after-hour trade, after saying on Wednesday its production of oil and gas has declined from a relatively strong fourth quarter while work on two of its three biggest U.S. refineries cut into downstream performance. In the tech sector, Microsoft plummeted 3.43% in early trading amid reports it is developing a new lineup of Surface tablets, including a 7-inch version expected to go into mass production later this year. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were higher. The EURO STOXX 50 added 0.18%, France\u2019s CAC 40 climbed 0.45%, Germany's DAX advanced 0.46%, while Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.29%.  During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 0.3%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index rallied 1.96%.

The BoJ conducted its first government bond purchasing operation on Monday, purchasing JPY1.2 trillion of Japanese government bonds maturing in five years or more. Sentiment also improved as official data showed that the annual rate of Chinese consumer inflation eased to 2.1% in March from 3.2% in February and below forecasts for 2.4%.The data eased market concerns over further policy tightening by the Chinese government. Alcoa was expected to be in focus, as shares dropped 0.36% in pre-market trade, after the U.S. aluminum group posted a better-than-expected first-quarter profit on Monday evening, but said revenue slightly missed estimates. Retailers were also likely to be active, after J.C. Penney parted ways with Chief Executive Ron Johnson and rehired Johnson's predecessor, former CEO Myron Ullman, to revive the company, sending shares down 5.10% in early trading.  In the energy sector, Brazil's oil regulator, the ANP, said on Monday that it authorized Chevron to restart output from an offshore oil field more than a year after a November 2011 spill forced U.S. oil giant to stop Brazilian production. In addition, Bloomberg reported that Exxon Mobil will have to pay New Hampshire USD236 million in damages for contaminating its drinking water with the gasoline additive MTBE. Shares edged up 0.02% after hours.  Elsewhere, General Motors was reportedly planning to deepen cuts to output at one of its South Korean plants in April to cope with slowing sales in Europe. Also in company news, the U.S. Justice Department said on Monday it had reached a settlement with chemical companies Ecolab and the privately held Permian Mud Service Inc, allowing their proposed merger to move forward without one of Permian's subsidiaries.

In Asian trading Wednesday, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 is higher by 0.73%, although USD/JPY is trading slightly lower. Some traders expect it is only a matter of days before the pair hits 100. On Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister looked to assuage skittish investors about the potentially adverse effects of the weaker yen. Abe said \"We\u2019ll make efforts to prevent (the yen\u2019s sharp slide) from strongly exerting a harmful influence (on the economy).\" Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose 0.37% while the Shanghai Composite gained 0.06% after China\u2019s Customs Administration said the country\u2019s exports increased 10% last month, missing analysts\u2019 estimates of a 10.5% increase. The data showed China\u2019s imports surged 14%, well above the consensus estimate of a 5.2% increase, leaving the world\u2019s second-largest economy with a trade deficit of USD884 million compared with a February surplus of USD15.3 billion. Surprisingly, Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.2% on the China news. China is the largest destination for Australian exports and the Chinese import number should have, in theory, been good news for Aussie equities. BHP Billiton, the world\u2019s largest mining company, is among the better performers in Australia today. New Zealand\u2019s NZSE 50 climbed 0.42% despite NZD/USD climbing above 85 cents for just the third time in three decades. New Zealand stocks were obviously not affected too deeply by the China data. China is New Zealand\u2019s largest trading partner as well. Singapore\u2019s Straits Times Index fell 0.27% while South Korea\u2019s Kospi gained 0.80% despite continued aggression from the north.

Meanwhile, investors were waiting to see if the U.S. central bank discussed the possibility of an earlier-than-expected end to its quantitative easing program at its March meeting, after examining the possibility at its previous two meetings.  Financial stocks were expected to be active, as Goldman Sachs was preparing to face a lawsuit in which Prudential Financial accused the U.S. lender of defrauding it into buying more than USD375 million of residential mortgage-backed securities it knew were unsafe. Shares in Goldman Sachs slipped 0.10% in after hour trade.  Hospital operator Health Management Associates was also likely to be in focus, after it reduced on Tuesday its outlook for 2013 earnings and revenue, citing weak patient admissions in the first quarter of the year, sending shares down 13.42% in late trading. In the same sector, Reuters reported that a Nevada jury awarded USD500 million in punitive damages in a case against two affiliates of UnitedHealth Group stemming from a hepatitis C outbreak in the state.  In the tech sector, Thermo Fisher Scientific made a binding offer for Life Technologies on Tuesday, marking another step in the race to finalize a consortium to take the genetic testing equipment maker private.

In Asian trading Friday, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 surged 3.55% as USD/JPY plunged after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda delivered the goods in terms of new stimulus measures. BoJ said it plans to double its asset purchase program over the next two years and extend the maturities of the bonds it purchases.It also plans to bring forward the timing of open-ended asset purchases and said it was likely to buy JPY7 trillion in long-term Japanese government bonds a month. Leading up to the BoJ meeting, the yen showed some strength as traders began doubting Kuroda\u2019s ability to build a consensus among central bank members for immediate easing. Kuroda proved those detractors wrong when he unveiled what he called a \"new phase of monetary easing.\" Thursday\u2019s moves in USD/JPY and EUR/JPY were the largest for those pairs since 2008. The Shanghai Composite is closed today, but Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng is off 1.86%. Earlier this week, Chinese stocks fell to their lowest levels in three months. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell below 4,900 for the first time in two months on concerns about Friday\u2019s U.S. jobs report. That concern may be well-founded following Thursday\u2019s data point out of the U.S. In U.S. economic news, initial claims for jobless benefits rose by 28,000 last week to 385,000, the highest level in four months. That reading is well above the 353,000 claims economists expected. The less volatile four-week moving average increased by 11,250 claims to 354,250. The Labor Department delivers the March non-farm payroll report and U.S. unemployment rate Friday before the open of U.S. markets. New Zealand\u2019s NZSE 50 fell 0.19% while Singapore\u2019s Straits Times Index is lower by 0.25%. South Korea\u2019s Kospi plunged 1.64%, highlighting a now familiar inverse correlation between that country\u2019s stocks and a weaker yen. South Korean auto and electronics makers compete directly with those in Japan and a weaker yen is seen as a potential drag on South Korean exporters. S&P 500 futures slipped 0.13% ahead of the jobs report.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 4, "day": 4}

Official data showed that the number of people who filed for initial unemployment assistance in the U.S. rose by 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 357,000 last week, compared to expectations for an increase to 340,000.A separate report showed that U.S. gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 0.4% in the three months to December, lower than forecasts for a 0.5% expansion.The growth rate was the slowest since the first quarter of 2011, but was higher than initial estimates for growth of 0.1%. Investors remained cautious, as as banks in Cyprus reopened for the first time in almost two weeks with strict capital controls in place. Cypriot banks had been closed since March 16 amid fears of a bank run while bailout talks were under way. Financial stocks were broadly higher, as shares in JP Morgan and Bank of America added 0.17% and 0.25%, while Citigroup and Goldman Sachs gained 0.25% and 0.73% respectively. On Wednesday, Citigroup won the dismissal of a lawsuit by Woori Bank over losses from mortgage-related investments, while a federal judge said JP Morgan must face a lawsuit by a pension plan that accused it of mismanaging its money by investing in Lehman Brothers Holdings notes before the bank filed for bankruptcy in 2008. In addition, Reuters reported that fifteen major banks sued by the Federal Housing Finance Agency over risky housing debt urged a U.S. appeals court on Wednesday to intervene, citing \"gravely prejudicial\" rulings by the trial judge coordinating the litigation.

Sentiment weakened on Monday following news that a one-time tax was to be imposed on bank deposit holders as part of a EUR10 billion bailout deal for Cyprus.The agreement marked the first time since the onset of the euro zone debt crisis that depositors have been forced to take a haircut in return for financial aid.  Meanwhile, investors were looking ahead to the outcome of the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy meeting on Wednesday after data on Friday showing that U.S. inflation was contained in February left the way clear for the bank to continue its asset purchase program.  Financial stocks were expected to be active, after Citigroup said it agreed to pay USD730 million to settle a class action lawsuit on behalf of investors who said they were misled by the lender's disclosures.  Separately, BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, was reportedly preparing to cut nearly 300 jobs, or about 3% of its workforce.  Aircraft manufacturers Boeing was also likely to remain in focus, technical workers voted to ratify a new four-year labor agreement with the company, ending the possibility of a strike that could have cut production.  Among pharmaceuticals, drugmaker Affymax was slated to move lower, following a more than 57% drop on Monday, after it said it was considering selling itself or filing for bankruptcy, as it struggles to stay afloat following the recent recall of its sole commercial product, the anemia drug Omontys.  Elsewhere, the head of Valero Energy said on Monday his company is not pursuing a sale of its two California refineries, putting an end to months of speculation.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.01% dip, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.04% loss, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.06% gain. On Thursday, the Department of Labor said the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. fell by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 332,000, last week compared to expectations for an increase of 8,000 to 350,000.The unexpectedly strong data, together with recent stronger-than-forecast data on nonfarm payrolls and retail sales fuelled optimism over the durability of the U.S. economic recovery.  Tech stocks were expected to be active, after Samsung Electronics challenged rival U.S. company Apple on its home turf, as the South Korean technology giant premiered its latest flagship phone, the Galaxy S4, which sports a bigger display and unconventional features such as gesture controls.  Apple shares were up 0.73% in pre-market trade.  Separately, IBM and EMC were said to be among the parties in talks to buy privately held database web hosting company SoftLayer Technologies, in a deal that could fetch over USD2 billion.  Aircraft manufacturer Boeing was also likely to be in focus, after the company expressed confidence that it could have its grounded 787 Dreamliner jets flying again in a matter of weeks.  In addition, Boeing unveiled its proposed fix for the aircraft's battery system that should eliminate the risk of fire. In the financial sector, Bloomberg reported that JPMorgan paid Achilles Macris USD31.8 million in the two years before the firm piled up at least USD6.2 billion of losses on a portfolio he oversaw, more than his boss Ina Drew and among the most at the bank. In addition, a Senate report outlined on Thursday JPMorgan's efforts to hide trading losses, which could ignite debate over whether the largest U.S. bank is too big to manage, adding pressure on CEO Jamie Dimon to surrender his role as chairman. The news sent shares in the U.S. lender tumbling 1.49% in early trading. Separately, media reports revealed that Morgan Stanley could be sued by Singapore\u2019s Hong Leong Finance in a New York court over claims it deceptively sold instruments designed to fail.

During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.22%, the S&P 500 index added 0.11%, while the Nasdaq Composite index edged up 0.09%.  The U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits fell by 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 340,000 last week, compared to expectations for an increase of 8,000 to 355,000.A separate report showed that the U.S. trade deficit widened to a seasonally adjusted USD44.5 billion in January from a deficit of USD38.1 billion the previous month.  Meanwhile, speaking at the ECB\u2019s post-policy meeting press conference, Draghi said monetary policy will remain firmly accommodative and added that confidence was returning to financial markets.  Among earnings, Smithfield Foods surged 6.05% after the pork producer posted quarterly results that topped market expectations, thanks to higher sales of its packaged products.  Financial stocks added to gains, as shares in Goldman Sachs climbed 0.47% and JP Morgan rose 0.30%, while Bank of America jumped 0.92%. Citigroup underperformed on the other hand, slipping 0.16%.  In company news, Bloomberg reported that Time Warner will spin off its magazine business later this year, turning the nine-decade-old publisher of Time, People and Sports Illustrated into a separate publicly held company.  The report sent Time Warner shares up 1.91%.  Elsewhere, Johnson Controls rose 0.37% as the auto-parts maker was said to be exploring a potential sale of its automotive electronics business, but has no \"current intention\" to sell its automotive interiors unit.  In the retail sector, Costco Wholesale gained 0.76% after posting a 6% rise in comparable sales in February, beating marketexpectations, thanks to higher fuel prices. On the downside, Dell shares dipped 0.05%, following reports investor Carl Icahn built a stake of around 100 million shares in the personal computer maker and wants it to conduct a leveraged recapitalization, complicating founder Michael Dell's effort to take the company private. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were higher. The EURO STOXX 50 rose 0.36%, France\u2019s CAC 40 advanced 0.39%, Germany's DAX added 0.19%, while Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.34%.

In Asian trading Friday, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 surged after a report showed that Japan\u2019s GDP rose 0.2% in the fourth quarter following an initial reading that showed a contraction of 0.4%. Japanese shares also benefited from a weaker yen with USD/JPY rising 0.56% to the highest levels in nearly four years. The Nikkei is in position for its best weekly performance of 2013. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng jumped 1.15%, but the Shanghai Composite fell 0.18% after a report showed hina\u2019s January and February combined exports jumped 23.6%, easily topping analysts\u2019 expectations for a 17.6% increase. The Shanghai Composite may be trading lower due to the import data, which rose just 5% last month, well below the 10% increase economists expected. Industrial output data for January and February is expected to show a 10.5% increase when that number is published. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.3% while New Zealand\u2019s NZSE 50 added 0.47%, gains that indicate stocks in those countries are benefiting from AUD/USD and NZD/USD trading lower. Traders are bidding Australian and New Zealand stocks higher despite the Chinese import data. China is the largest trading partner for both Australia and New Zealand. South Korea\u2019s Kospi is off 0.09%, arguably do in large part to the weaker yen. South Korean electronics and automobile makers are major competitors to Japanese equivalents and a weaker yen is seen as damaging to South Korean shares. Singapore\u2019s Straits Times Index is lower by 0.19%. S&P 500 futures are lower by 0.07% head of the February non-farm payroll report due out from the U.S. Labor Department later today. Economists expect the U.S. economy, the world\u2019s largest, to show the addition of 160,000 jobs last month. \n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 3, "day": 7}

During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.46%, the S&P 500 index climbed 0.40%, while the Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.25%.  The U.S. Department of Labor Statistics said the economy added 236,000 jobs in February, far more than the expected 160,000 increase, after a 119,000 rise the previous month.  The U.S. private sector added 246,000 jobs, beating expectations for a 167,000 increase, following January's 140,000 rise.  The report also showed that the U.S. unemployment rate ticked down unexpectedly to 7.7% in February, from 7.9% the previous month. Analysts had expected the unemployment rate to remain unchanged last month. In the tech sector, Google dipped 0.01% amid reports the company's Motorola Mobility unit is preparing to cut another 1,200 jobs or 10% of its workforce, as the smartphone maker tries to return to profitability. Separately, a judge ruled on Thursday that Apple must show in detail how it\u2019s complying with court orders to turn over evidence in a privacy lawsuit, sending shares in the iPhone maker down 0.32%. According to Bloomberg, U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul S. Grewal in San Jose, California, issued the order after the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers claimed Apple withheld documents it had previously been ordered to produce. On the upside, insurer American International Group jumped 0.97% after saying it will redeem USD1.1 billion of debentures as the company seeks to reduce debt before reinstating a dividend.  Elsewhere, Pandora Media soared 22.76%, after posting stronger-than-expected quarterly results. The company also said CEO Joseph Kennedy is stepping down in a surprise announcement. In the financial sector, stocks were mixed. Bank of America advanced 0.57% and Citigroup rallied 2.20%, while JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs slid 0.57% and 0.76% respectively. Other stocks in focus included Ann Taylor and Foot Locker, due to report earnings later in the day. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were higher. The EURO STOXX 50 jumped 1.52%, France\u2019s CAC 40 rallied 1.44%, Germany's DAX gained 0.82%, while Britain's FTSE 100 climbed 0.72%.

During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.67%, the S&P 500 index retreated 0.71%, while the Nasdaq Composite index slid 0.79%. Investors remained cautious as the \"sequester\" of USD85 billion of automatic spending cuts was set to hit at midnight on Friday. U.S. President Barack Obama was to meet with Congressional leaders at the White House during the day to discuss ways to avoid sequestration striking, but hopes were low for a deal as Democrats and Republicans have so far failed to reach a compromise.  Meanwhile, disappointing data from the euro zone sparked fresh concerns over the outlook for growth in the bloc. A report earlier showed that the unemployment rate in the euro zone rose to a new record high of 11.9% in January from 11.8% the previous month.  Among earnings, Gap rose 0.76% after the clothes retailer said that fourth-quarter profit beat estimates, thanks to higher comparable store sales in North America. Adding to gains, consumer electronics group Best Buy surged 5.67% after posting quarterly results that topped expectations.  Earlier in the day, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company ended talks with founder Richard Schulze over a deal in which he and a group of buyout firms were proposing to take a minority stake in the firm in exchange for three seats on the board.  Elsewhere, Groupon rallied 2.19% after the company fired on Thursday Andrew Mason as CEO for failing to put an end to the gradual erosion of the company's main daily deals business.  Financial stocks trended broadly lower on the other hand, as shares in JP Morgan tumbled 0.96% and Goldman Sachs plummeted 1.47%, while Bank of America and Citigroup plunged 1.69% and 2.14% respectively. Bank of America said in a securities filing on Thursday that the New York State Attorney General was investigating the bank over its purchase, securitization and underwriting of home loans.  Also on the downside, Boeing slipped 0.13% amid reports it is preparing to cut hundreds of jobs at a South Carolina plant that makes 787 Dreamliners over the course of this year. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were sharply lower. The EURO STOXX 50 plummeted 1.58%, France\u2019s CAC 40 tumbled 1.54%, Germany's DAX retreated 1.33%, while Britain's FTSE 100 dropped 0.55%. During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 0.61%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index advanced 0.41%.  Also Friday, official data showed that U.S. personal spending rose 0.2% in January, in line with expectations, after a 0.1% rise the previous month.  Later in the day, the U.S. was to release a report from the Institute of Supply Management on manufacturing activity and revised data on consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 3, "day": 1}

During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.58%, the S&P 500 index climbed 0.41%, while the Nasdaq Composite index added 0.11%.  Italy\u2019s center-left coalition, led by the Democratic Party's Pier Luigi Bersani, won the majority of votes in the lower house and was likely to receive the mandate to form a government.However, projections indicated that no party would be able to form a majority in the upper house, leading to a deadlock.  Meanwhile, market participants were looking ahead to congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke later in the trading day, after last week\u2019s minutes of the central bank\u2019s January meeting showed that some policymakers favored an early end to the Fed's monetary easing measures. Among earnings, Home Depot surged 4.65% after the home improvement retailer posted results that topped expectations and said it would buy back as much as USD17 billion of its own shares. Department store retailer Macy's added to gains, rallying 4%, after it reported quarterly results that exceeded analysts' expectations.  In the tech sector, Intel jumped 1.64% after it agreed to make chips on behalf of Altera, taking a step toward opening its manufacturing technology to customers on a larger scale. Financial stocks were broadly lower on the other hand, as shares in Bank of America retreated 0.36% and JP Morgan tumbled 1.01%, while Goldman Sachs and Citigroup plummeted 1.47% and 2.58% respectively. Goldman Sachs was set to begin its annual job cutting process as soon as this week, according to a Bloomberg report.  Separately, JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon was reportedly preparing to lead his new team of managers in an annual day of presentations to Wall Street about the outlook for businesses operated by the U.S. lender. Facebook was also on the downside, with shares plummeting 1.29%. The social media giant agreed on Monday to take harassing postings off tribute pages for victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting after meeting with Connecticut\u2019s attorney general about the sites. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were sharply lower. The EURO STOXX 50 plunging 2.11%, France\u2019s CAC 40 plummeted 1.72%, Germany's DAX tumbled 1.55%, while Britain's FTSE 100 retreated 1.10%. During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled 1.32%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index plunged 2.26%.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.14% increase, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.11% rise, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.09% gain.  Markets were jittery after the Italian election ended on Tuesday with no party or coalition in control of the Senate, raising the threat of a prolonged period of political instability and potentially reigniting the crisis in the euro zone.Meanwhile, investors were looking ahead to a second day of Congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke later in the trading day. Bernanke defended the bank's easing program on Tuesday, saying that the benefits outweighed the possible costs.  Aircraft companies were expected to be active, after Airbus parent EADS predicted higher profit this year, thanks to stronger-than-expected 2012 earnings and lower costs.  Separately, U.S. aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney said it is 99% sure the fan blade problem that grounded the Pentagon's 51 new F-35 fighter jets was not caused by high-cycle fatigue, which could force a costly design change, according to a Reuters report. Among earnings, Priceline and Edison International reported fourth-quarter results that beat analysts' projections, sending shares in both companies up 4.25% and 4.08% respectively in pre-market trade. In the tech sector, Guidewire Software, a developer of software for insurance companies, surged 14.27% in early trading after the company raised its full-year revenue target to a range of USD286 million to USD292 million, exceeding analysts's estimates. Elsewhere, hospital billings and collections firm Accretive Health was also likely to be in focus, after it withdrew its financial guidance and postponed its quarterly earnings report, previously scheduled for release on Wednesday, sending shares diving 13.29% pre-market. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were higher. The EURO STOXX 50 climbed 0.45%, France\u2019s CAC 40 advanced 0.71%, Germany's DAX rose 0.25%, while Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.24%. During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index edged up 0.25%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index tumbled 1.27%.

In Asian trading Thursday, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell 1.25% amid a volatile session for USD/JPY. The yen is currently trading modestly higher against the greenback after a Japanese newspaper reported that former Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Kazumasa Iwata and Asian Development Bank leader Haruhiko Kuroda are seen as the leading candidates to become the next BoJ governor. That media report would also, though indirectly, confirm speculation that former BoJ Deputy Governor Toshiro Muto is no longer a top candidates to lead the central bank. Muto appears to fallen off the government\u2019s list of candidates in recent days. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Sang tumbled 1.81% and the Shanghai Composite plunged 2.74% after China said it will initiate property curbs aimed at cooling what some there see as an overheated property market. China has taken similar steps in the past and is again looking to temper real estate speculation. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 Index slid 1.7% following a glum profit outlook from energy retailer Orion Energy. AUD/USD weakened as traders dumped riskier currencies following the FOMC minutes. Indicating that risk on assets are not in style today, New Zealand\u2019s NZSE 50 slid 1.04% even after Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler sounded a positive tone regarding the central bank\u2019s possible intervention in the currency market to weaken the kiwi. Wheeler was clear to note he wants any intervention efforts to make a difference and that RBNZ would intervene \"when circumstances are right.\" Wheeler made the remarks on Wednesday before the Manufacturers and Exporters Association. Elsewhere, South Korea\u2019s Kospi fell 0.56% a day after what was one of its best performances of 2013. Singapore\u2019s Straits Times Index dropped 0.58%. S&P 500 futures gave up 0.09%.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 2, "day": 20}

Sentiment weakened on Thursday, after official data showed that euro zone gross domestic product contracted by 0.6% in the three months to December, compared to expectations for a 0.4% decline, after a 0.1% contraction in the third quarter.It was the fastest rate of decline since 2009 and marked a third consecutive quarter of contraction.In addition, Germany\u2019s economy, the euro zone\u2019s largest, contracted by 0.6% in the in the fourth quarter, more than expectations for a 0.5% drop on declining exports and investment.

Separately, DirecTV warned that Venezuela's recent currency devaluation will crimp its results this year and said it was still considering buying Brazilian telecom operator GVT, sending shares down 0.26% pre-market.

During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.32%, the S&P 500 index fell 0.22%, while the Nasdaq Composite index edged 0.14% lower.  Market sentiment weakened after the European Central Bank said last week that it would monitor developments in the markets to see if the stronger euro had an effect on the inflation outlook. Investor confidence was also hit by uncertainty ahead of upcoming elections in Italy and renewed political tensions in Spain where the government has become embroiled in a corruption scandal.  In the U.S., official data showed on Friday that the trade deficit narrowed more-than-expected in December, moving to USD38.5 billion from a deficit of USD48.6 billion.  Analysts had expected the trade deficit to narrow to USD46 billion in December.  Google dropped 0.76% following reports Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt is selling roughly 42% of his stake in the company.  Tech stocks were also in focus, as three of Dell's largest investors joined Southeastern Asset Management on Friday in objecting to a USD24.4 billion buyout of the PC maker led by Chief Executive Michael Dell. The news sent shares in Dell down 0.66%.  On the upside, Apple added 0.22%, after the New York Times reported that the tech giant is experimenting with the design of a device similar to a wristwatch that would operate on the same platform as the iPhone and would be made with curved glass.  Elsewhere, Boeing retreated 0.40%, even as it ompleted what it called an uneventful flight on Saturday of a test 787 Dreamliner. It was the aircraft's first flight since the Dreamliners were grounded more than three weeks ago after a series of battery-related problems.  Among earnings, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners reported that its fourth quarter earnings surged by 26%, beating analysts' estimates and sending shares up 0.11%. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were mixed. The EURO STOXX 50 slipped 0.11%, France\u2019s CAC 40 rose 0.26%, Germany's DAX fell 0.25%, while Britain's FTSE 100 edged up 0.20%.  During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index remained closed for national holidays.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 2, "day": 11}

The data further support the notion that the world\u2019s second-largest economy is performing well. In Asian trading Friday, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 sank 1.11% as traders were seen taking profits in USD/JPY following the yen\u2019s recent weakness.  The yen move higher today after Japan reported a December current account deficit of JPY264.1 billion, well above the consensus estimate of JPY144.2 billion. That pared the full-year current account surplus to JPY4.7 trillion. A weaker yen, which is believed to be boosting Japanese exports, is seen as helping the current account situation. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose 0.11% while the Shanghai Composite added 0.4% after China said exports surged 25% last month while imports jumped 28.8%. Analysts expected the January export number to rise just 17.7%. China\u2019s Statistics Bureau is set to release inflation data later today with analysts expecting a 2% increase following a 2.5% rise in the prior month. The Hang Seng will be closed three days next week and the Shanghai Composite will be closed all week due to Chinese New Year festivities. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.3% even after the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered its 2013 GDP growth and inflation estimates. Earlier today, RBA pared its 2013 GDP growth outlook to 2.5% from its November forecast of 2.75%. RBA also trimmed its inflation estimate to 3% from 3.25%. The central bank also said the Aussie dollar\u2019s strength impact on inflation may be longer-lasting than expected.

During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.19%, the S&P 500 index dipped 0.03%, while the Nasdaq Composite index inched up 0.04%.  In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending February 3 fell by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 366,000, compared to expectations for a decline of 11,000 to 360,000.Jobless claims for the preceding week were revised up to 371,000 from a previously reported gain of 368,000.  The data came after Draghi said the recent appreciation in the single currency reflected growing signs of a return of investor confidence in the euro zone. He added that economic weakness in the euro area would persist during the early part of 2013 but said the economy should start to recover \u201clater\u201d in the year. CVS Caremark slipped 0.18% after saying it bought Drogaria Onofre, Brazil's eighth-largest drugstore chain, marking the first time the drugstore and pharmacy services company has ventured outside the U.S.  In the tech sector, Michael Dell and his investment firm are reportedly putting up USD750 million in cash toward the USD24.4 billion purchase of Dell Inc. Shares in the company dropped 0.35% at the open of the U.S. trading session.  Akamai also trended lower, diving 18.11% after the Internet content delivery company handed in a disappointing current-quarter revenue outlook.  On the upside, Herbalife surged 1.98% as it disclosed more information on Wednesday about how much its U.S. distributors earn, looking to provide more clarity as it defends its business model from critics.  DeVry added to gains, skyrocketing 21.71% after the for-profit education company blew past earnings expectations and JPMorgan raised its rating on the firm to \"neutral\" from \"underweight.\"  Meanwhile, financial stocks were mixed.

In Asian trading Tuesday, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 surged 2.41% after Haruhiko Kuroda, believed by some traders to be a leading contender to be the next BoJ governor, said Japan has the room to deploy additional monetary stimulus in 2013. Those comments jibe with what Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants: Unlimited and immediate easing aimed at weakening the yen and curing Japan of its deflationary ills. Kuroda is currently head of the Asian Development Bank. Last month, BoJ said it would commit to Federal Reserve-style asset-buying, but that it would not engage in that program until 2014, disappointing traders that were expecting more immediate stimulus. Japanese markets were closed yesterday. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and the Shanghai Composite are closed again today in observance of the Chinese New Year. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 Index added 0.1% as traders appeared to be increase their wagers that the the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut interest rates by nearly 50 basis points.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.18% rise, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.20% increase, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.18% gain. Market sentiment weakened after the European Central Bank said last week that it would monitor developments in the markets to see if the stronger euro had an effect on the inflation outlook. Investor confidence was also hit by uncertainty ahead of upcoming elections in Italy and renewed political tensions in Spain where the government has become embroiled in a corruption scandal.  In the U.S., official data showed on Friday that the trade deficit narrowed more-than-expected in December, moving to USD38.5 billion from a deficit of USD48.6 billion.  Analysts had expected the trade deficit to narrow to USD46 billion in December.  Software companies were expected to be active, amid reports Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt is selling roughly 42% of his stake in the company, sending shares down 0.87% in pre-market trade.  Tech stocks were also likely to be in focus, as three of Dell's largest investors joined Southeastern Asset Management on Friday in objecting to a USD24.4 billion buyout of the PC maker led by Chief Executive Michael Dell. Shares in the company climbed 0.59% in early trading.  In addition, Apple advanced 0.63% pre-market, after the New York Times reported that the tech giant is experimenting with the design of a device similar to a wristwatch that would operate on the same platform as the iPhone and would be made with curved glass.  Elsewhere, Boeing completed what it called an uneventful flight on Saturday of a test 787 Dreamliner. It was the aircraft's first flight since the Dreamliners were grounded more than three weeks ago after a series of battery-related problems.  Shares in the company were up 0.30% in pre-market trade.  Separately, US Airways Group and AMR Corp were reportedly nearing an USD11 billion merger that would create the world's largest airline and could announce a deal within a week.

The media sector was expected to be active, after Rupert Murdoch's News Corp on Wednesday reported higher quarterly revenue and profit on strong growth at its cable assets, including its Regional Sports and FX networks.  Pharmaceutical companies were also likely to be in focus, as CVS Caremark said it bought Drogaria Onofre, Brazil's eighth-largest drugstore chain, marking the first time the drugstore and pharmacy services company has ventured outside the U.S.  In the tech sector, Michael Dell and his investment firm are reportedly putting up USD750 million in cash toward the USD24.4 billion purchase of Dell Inc.

In Asian trading Tuesday, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 tumbled 1.13% as traders ran into safe-haven currencies such as the yen and U.S. dollar following some discouraging headlines out of Italy and Spain released Monday. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng plunged 1.7% while the Shanghai Composite slid 0.4% after Sinopec, China\u2019s second-largest oil company, announced a USD3.1 billion secondary share offering. While Sinopec said it will use the proceeds to bolster production assets, secondary offerings usually pressure stocks because the offerings dilute current shareholders.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.09% loss, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.14% fall, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.35% drop.  On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve said that it will continue its USD85 billion a month quantitative easing program \u201cif the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially.\u201dThe U.S. central bank also reiterated that it will continue to hold interest rates close to zero until the unemployment rate falls below 6.5%.  The statement came after data showed that the U.S. economy contracted 0.1% in the fourth quarter, confounding expectations for growth of 1.1% and a sharp slowdown from growth of 3.1% in the preceding quarter.  Facebook was expected to be active after it doubled its mobile advertising revenue in the fourth quarter, a sign that the social network giants is seeing early success in expanding onto handheld devices as more of its users migrate to smartphones and tablets. However, shares in the company plunged 5.89% in pre-market trade.  Among earnings, Electronic Arts tumbled 1.53% after hours, as the company slashed its fiscal 2013 earnings forecast after a weaker-than-expected holiday quarter, due to disappointing sales of its \"Medal of Honor\" title.  ConocoPhillips also slipped in after hour trade, down 0.15%, after reporting a drop in quarterly profit as oil and gas prices weakened and output from the third-largest U.S. oil and gas producer remained steady compared with a year before.  In the financial sector, Citigroup was said to be looking to pull out of consumer banking in a number of countries, with hopes of lowering costs and boosting profits. The news sent shares down 0.14% after hours. Elsewhere, Boeing edged down 0.28% in late trading after All Nippon Airlines said it lost more than USD15 million in revenue from having to cancel Dreamliner flights this month. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were lower. The EURO STOXX 50 retreated 0.97%, France\u2019s CAC 40 tumbled 1.03%, Germany's DAX declined 0.58%, while Britain's FTSE 100 slid 0.61%. During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 0.39%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index added 0.22%.

During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.37%, the S&P 500 index eased up 0.01%, while the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.50%.  Markets were eyeing U.S. budget negotiations after Republican leaders in the House of Representatives said they aim to pass on Wednesday a nearly four-month extension of the U.S. debt limit allowing the government to borrow enough to meet its obligations during that period. Among earnings, Google surged 5.35% after reporting on Tuesday, after the closing bell, that revenue from its core Internet business outpaced many analysts' expectations during the holiday quarter, while advertising rates fell less than in previous periods.  IBM also trended sharply higher, rallying 4.79%, after the company gave a better than expected 2013 outlook after a solid fourth quarter that analysts say has more to do with Big Blue's smooth execution than a vibrant tech spending environment. In addition, WellPoint jumped 1.03% after the second-biggest U.S. health insurer reported fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates as medical costs were lower than anticipated. However, the company gave a 2013 earnings forecast that was less than analysts expected. Shortly before the start of U.S. trade, United Technologies beat earnings expectations, even though profit actually declined, sending shares down 0.14%, while McDonald's topped earnings and revenue expectations, but warned that it sees sales lower early in the first quarter. Shares in the fast food chain added 0.20% after the open. Elsewhere, financial stocks were mixed, as shares in Bank of America inched up 0.09% and Citigroup rose 0.19%, while JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs declined 0.28% and 0.26% respectively.  Earlier in the day, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon apologized to shareholders for the USD6 billion loss caused by the so-called \"whale\" trade, calling it a \"terrible mistake,\" but said the bank has moved on and is still highly profitable.

Sentiment strengthened earlier, after data showed that China\u2019s preliminary HSBC manufacturing PMI improved to 51.9 in January, a two-year high, from a final reading of 51.5 in December, adding to signs of a rebound in the world\u2019s second largest economy. Tech giant Apple was expected to be active as the company announced, after the closing bell on Wednesday, that it misses analysts' revenue forecast for the third straight quarter, after iPhone sales came in below expectations. Apple shares dove 8.90% in pre-market trade. In addition, a U.S. trade panel that specializes in patent disputes was set to review a key decision in the patent fight between Samsung Electronics and Apple over smartphones and tablets. In the software sector, hard disk drive maker Western Digital's second-quarter results beat analysts' expectations, but shares plummeted 1.42% after hours.  Elsewhere, Netflix announced a quarterly profit after the video subscription service added nearly 4 million customers in the U.S. and abroad, sending its shares soaring 35.58% in early trading.  Commodity-linked stocks were also likely to be in focus, after Noble Corp reported on Wednesday a lower-than-expected quarterly profit as it struggled with maintenance for five high-end rigs, even as demand for its most capable units increased. Shares were down 0.48% in after hour trade.  Other stocks expected to be in the spotlight included Bristol-Myers Squibb, Lockheed Martin, 3M, Microsoft and Starbucks, due to report earnings later in the day.

Investors remained cautious however, as euro zone ministers were still seeking an agreement on how and when the euro zone bailout fund, the European Stability Mecanism, can bypass governments and provide direct help to banks.  Meanwhile, markets were also eyeing U.S. budget negotiations after Republican leaders in the House of Representatives said they aim to pass on Wednesday a nearly four-month extension of the U.S. debt limit allowing the government to borrow enough to meet its obligations during that period. Bellwethers such as CSX, Google, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, Texas Instruments and Verizon were all slated to release fourth-quarter earnings reports later Tuesday. DuPont was up 1.11% in pre-market trade, after reporting higher-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings per share on Monday and revenue of USD7.3 billion.  Retailers were also expected to be active after the Wall Street Journal reported that Wal-Mart Stores plans to cut ties immediately with suppliers who subcontract work to factories without the retailer's knowledge. The move is due to change the company's policy after a fire killed more than 100 garment workers in Bangladesh.  Elsewhere, Boeing was set to be in focus, as U.S. and Japanese aviation safety officials investigating problems with the 787 Dreamliner visited the headquarters of the plane's battery maker on Monday. Shares in the company tumbled 1.32% pre-market. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were lower.

Meanwhile, uncertainty over the U.S. debt ceiling deadlock continued to weigh after President Barack Obama urged Republicans earlier in the week to approve an increase in the borrowing limit without seeking policy concessions in return. Financial stocks were broadly lower after disappointing earnings reports. Bank of America plunged 3.65% after topping expectations but reporting a profit that was lower than a year ago. Citigroup wasn't far behind, with shares plummeting 3.63% after the U.S. lender posted a wide earnings miss, with the new CEO citing a \"challenging\" environment due to increased regulatory pressures and legal costs.  Meanwhile, shares in Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, who both posted results that beat expectations on Wednesday, retreated 0.75% and 0.68% respectively.

Separately, ARM Holdings, whose chips power Apple\u2019s iPhones, remained in negative territory for the second consecutive session, sliding 1.31%, after Sanford C.

On Tuesday, the stock was cut to equal weight at Morgan Stanley. In the U.S., equity markets pointed to a moderately lower open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.35% drop, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.23% fall, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.08% loss.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.14% fall, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.23% decline, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.18% loss.In a speech on the economy and monetary policy on Monday, Fed Chairman Bernanke said that he was still unsatisfied with the economy\u2019s progress, despite some recent signs of improvement. Earlier Monday, the president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank said he expected the Fed to continue its bond buying program \"well into the second half of 2013.\"  But investors remained cautious, as negotiations on raising the U.S. debt ceiling were coming up in February.  Financial stocks were expected to be active, after U.S. banking regulators on Monday ordered JPMorgan Chase to tighten its risk controls after the bank lost billions of dollars due to bad bets from a trader known as the \"London Whale\".  JP Morgan was down 0.39% in pre-market trade, while Bank of America dropped 0.35%.  The retail sector was also likely to be in focus, after RadioShack said it ended a mobile phone partnership with Target, as the two companies could not agree on a new deal that would be profitable for both companies. Shares in RadioShack surged 7.79% in early trading. Among tech companies, Dell rallied 3.66% pre-market, following reports the computer maker is discussing a leveraged buyout with private-equity firms TPG Capital and Silver Lake.  Elsewhere, U.S. cable group Liberty Global reportedly raised its stake in Belgian group Telenet to 58% from 50.2%. Liberty has been the controlling shareholder in the company since 2007. Other stocks in focus included homebuilder Lennar before the market open. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were mixed to lower. The EURO STOXX 50 fell 0.26%, France\u2019s CAC 40 dipped 0.04%, Germany's DAX edged down 0.20%, while Britain's FTSE 100 inched up 0.07%. During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slipped 0.14%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index climbed 0.72%. Later in the day, the U.S. was to publish government data on retail sales, as well as official data on producer price inflation and manufacturing activity in New York state.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 1, "day": 14}

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.06% fall, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.01% dip, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.04% gain. Sentiment strengthened after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Thursday that a gradual economic recovery would begin this year, as structural reforms and actions by the ECB to tackle the region\u2019s debt crisis continued to take effect.  Earlier Friday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe unveiled a JPY10.3 trillion stimulus package to end deflation and boost growth.  According to the Cabinet Office, about JPY3.8 trillion will go to disaster prevention and reconstruction, with JPY3.1 trillion directed to stimulating private investment and other measures. Retail-related stocks were expected to be active, after tycoon Carlos Slim's retail unit said it plans to relist on the Mexican stock exchange, offering a 15.2% stake to raise around USD720 million to fund expansion plans. Separately, Supervalu struck a USD3.3 billion deal to reduce its burdensome debt by selling five of its supermarket chains to an investor group led by Cerberus Capital Management.  Commodity-linked stocks were also likely to be in focus, as Exxon Mobil reported flaring at its 344,500 barrel-per-day Beaumont, Texas, refinery.

During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.09%, the S&P 500 index edged up 0.12%, while the Nasdaq Composite index slipped 0.15%.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the U.S. economy added 155,000 jobs in December, more than the expected 150,000 increase, after an upwardly revised 161,000 rise the previous month.  In addition, the U.S. employment rate remained unchanged at 7.8% last month, compared with expectations for a decline to 7.7%.  Markets were jittery after the minutes of the Fed's December policy meeting showed that officials began debating an end to bond-buying as early as this year even while preparing to boost stimulus to a new record.  Investors also remained cautious over the longer term outlook in the U.S., with negotiations on raising the debt ceiling still to come in February. Financial stocks were mixed, as shares in Bank of America eased 0.08% and Goldman Sachs fell 0.34%, while JP Morgan inched up 0.04% and Citigroup climbed 0.97%. Citigroup was added Goldman Sachs' \"conviction buy\" list, while JPMorgan was removed from it, though the brokerage still rates the stock a \"buy.\"  Qualcomm added to losses, with shares tumbling 0.82% after New York State's USD150-billion public pension fund reportedly sued the chipmaker, with hopes of forcing it to reveal its political spending. Also in the tech sector, Intel dropped 0.54% and Texas Instruments slipped 0.27%, even as the Semiconductor Industry Association reported that November sales were up 2% from a year earlier, marking 2012's first year-over-year gain for the industry. On the upside, Google advanced 0.86% after the Federal Trade Commission closed its investigation against the company for antitrust violations Thursday. The FTC investigated Google for nearly two years for various business practices, primarily concerning how the company displays search results. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were higher. The EURO STOXX 50 added 0.16%, France\u2019s CAC 40 inched up 0.04%, Germany's DAX edged 0.10% higher, while Britain's FTSE 100 climbed 0.48%. During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slipped 0.29%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index surged 2.82%.  Later in the day, the Institute of Supply Management was to release a report on U.S. service sector activity.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2013, "month": 1, "day": 4}
