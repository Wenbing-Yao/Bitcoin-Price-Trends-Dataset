Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 1.33% drop, S&P 500 futures signaled a 1.43% decline, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 1.40% loss.Sentiment weakened after U.S. House Speaker John Boehner pulled his so-called Plan B fiscal cliff option, which called for tax increases only on those Americans earning USD1 million or more per year, because his Republican colleagues did not support the legislation. Although U.S. financial markets were to open Friday, the U.S. House has adjourned for the Christmas holiday, fueling speculation that policymakers will not be able to avert the fiscal cliff.  Failure to prevent tax hikes from taking effect at the end of this year right when automatic spending cuts are due to take effect could tip the U.S. economy into a recession.  Tech stocks were expected to be active, after Research In Motion reported on Thursday the first ever decline in its subscriber numbers and outlined plans to transform the way it charges for its BlackBerry services. Shares in the company were down 9.63% in pre-market trade.  Meanwhie, in its ongoing legal battle against Samsung Electronics, Apple argued on Thursday that a U.S. appeals court should reconsider its decision to overturn a pretrial sales ban on Samsung for infringement. Apple shares dropped 1.74% in early trading.  The software sector was also likely to be in focus, as Red Hat posted higher-than-expected third-quarter revenue, boosted by strong growth in its subscription business. Shares surged 6.99% pre-market  Separately, Instagram, the photo-sharing service owned by Facebook backed down on some of the controversial changes in its terms of service that had prompted a fierce backlash from users earlier in the week. Pre-market Facebook tumbled 1.39% on the news. In addition, defense-related stocks were slated to move, after the U.S. House of Representatives approved the final version of the annual defense policy bill on Thursday. The bill authorizes USD633.3 billion in defense spending for 2013.  Oil giant ConocoPhillips edged up 0.03% in late trading after saying it will sell its Nigerian businesses to Oando Energy Resources for about USD1.79 billion. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were lower. The EURO STOXX 50 dropped 0.63%, France\u2019s CAC 40 declined 0.48%, Germany's DAX slid 0.73%, while Britain's FTSE 100 retreated 0.79%. During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index declined 0.68%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index tunbled 0.99%.

Investor confidence also strengthened after HSBC\u2019s December flash reading of the China purchasing managers index came in at 50.9, topping the consensus estimate of 50.8 and the 50.5 November reading.  Meanwhile, investor focus shifted back to negotiations to avoid the U.S. fiscal cliff, amid concerns that the automatic tax hikes and spending cuts due to take effect in early 2013 could derail the U.S. recovery.  Tech stocks were expected to be active, after Apple released its iPhone 5 in China. The company's shares dropped 0.65% pre-market, nonetheless.

The ECB expects the euro zone economy to return to growth only in 2014, expanding between 0.2% and 2.2%.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.12% rise, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.11% gain, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.16% increase.Sentiment was boosted after Greece on Monday launched a scheme to buy back its debt from private investors, while Madrid formally requested a bailout to recapitalize its banking sector. Meanwhile, investors continued to watch negotiations between Democrats and Republicans to avoid the U.S. fiscal cliff, a set of spending cuts and tax increases due to come into effect on January 1 if lawmakers cannot reach an agreement on reducing the budget deficit.  The White House dismissed a proposal from congressional Republicans on Monday that included tax reforms and spending cuts, saying it did not meet President Barack Obama's pledge to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans.  Tech stocks were expected to be active, after Qualcomm said it was preparing to invest as much as USD120 million in Sharp, a cash injection likely to make it the struggling Japanese TV maker's biggest shareholder, in addition to boosting Sharp's efforts to remain viable. Shares in Qualcomm edged down 0.11% in after hour trading.  The energy sector was also likely to be in focus, amid reports Chevron is to reveal this week a highly anticipated mark-up on the price tag for the Gorgon liquefied natural gas export complex on a remote island off Western Australia. Chevron shares fell 0.23% after hours.  Elsewhere in company news, U.S. agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland tightened its grip on GrainCorp, hiking its bid to USD2.9 billion and buying more shares, but may need to offer more to win over Australia's last major independent grains handler.  In financial stocks, Cerberus Capital Management LP was reportedly in talks to join Virtu Financial LLC's bid for U.S. brokerage Knight Capital Group Inc, according to a Wall Street Journal report.  Other stocks in focus included Autozone, the largest U.S. auto parts retail chain, due to post quarterly results later in the day. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were higher.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.09% rise, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.02% gain, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.16% increase.On Thursday, the Obama administration and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives reached a deadlock over how to prevent the country going over the so-called \u201cfiscal cliff,\u201d USD600 billion worth of sharp federal spending cuts and tax increases, in January 2013.  Sentiment strengthened earlier in the week, as U.S. President Barack Obama said Wednesday he hoped to reach an agreement with Congress before Christmas.  The Internet sector was expected to be active, as Facebook and Zynga revised a years-old partnership between the two companies. Shares in Facebook dropped 0.55% in pre-market trade, while Zynga dove 12.60%.  In the tech sector, Apple's latest iPhone received final clearance from Chinese regulators, paving the way for a December debut in a highly competitive market where the lack of a new model had severely eroded its share of product sales.  Shares in the company edged up 0.07% in early trading, following the news. Meanwhile, Microsoft fell 0.19% pre-market, amid reports the company plans to overhaul how it develops the flagship Windows operating system in a strategic shift aimed at keeping pace with rivals Apple and Google. U.S. lender Citigroup was also likely to be in focus, following news the bank's trading and investment-banking division plans to eliminate 150 more jobs while shrinking bonuses by as much as 10%.

During late Asian trade, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed 0.73%, Australia\u2019s ASX/200 Index dipped 0.07%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index remained closed for a national holiday. Market sentiment improved after a report showed that China\u2019s preliminary HSBC manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4 in November, up from a final reading of 49.5 in October. The data eased concerns over a slowdown in the world\u2019s largest economy. Investor confidence also strengthened after German Chancellor Angela Merkel said an agreement to unlock a delayed bailout installment for Greece was still possible when euro zone finance ministers resume talks on Monday.Talks between finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund ended without a deal on Tuesday, amid disagreements on how best to reduce the country\u2019s debt to sustainable levels. Shares in Hong Kong trended sharply higher, boosted by strong gains in insurance companies. China Life Insurance jumped 1.33%, while Ping An advanced 0.94%. Energy stocks also added to gains, as shares in China Shenua surged 1.67% and Sino Land rallied 1.03%, while China Resources climbed 2.66. On the downside, Jiugui Liquor dove 10% after being accused of having potentially toxic substances in its products. Shares in the company had been suspended since Monday. Elsewhere, Australian shares slipped lower, as financial stocks were in focus after chief executive of ANZ said banks will need a small capital increase to meet Basel III global banking regulations. Australia and New Zealand Banking dropped 0.59% and National Australia Bank dipped 0.04%, while Commonwealth Bank Australia and Westpac Banking advanced 0.48% and 0.44% respectively. Mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton were on the upside, with shares both rising 0.18%, while mining services company Ausdrill plunged 14.63% after saying its full year revenue was expected to decline by USD50 million. Looking ahead, European stock futures pointed to a mixed to higher open, as attempts to reach a new bailout deal for Greece were set to continue. The EURO STOXX 50 futures pointed to a 0.22% rise, France\u2019s CAC 40 futures added 0.16%, London\u2019s FTSE 100 futures slipped 0.08%, while Germany's DAX futures pointed to a 0.09% gain. Later in the day, Germany was to release a report on business climate, while European Union leaders were to hold a second day of talks in Brussels to discuss Spain and Greece and plans for greater integration of fiscal and monetary policy in the region. Trade volumes were expected to remain light on Friday, with U.S. markets closing early for Thanksgiving weekend.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2012, "month": 11, "day": 22}

Trade volumes were expected to remain light, with U.S. markets closing early for Thanksgiving weekend. Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.17% rise, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.13% gain, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.30% increase. Market sentiment improved amid growing optimism that Greece's lenders are nearing an agreement to tackle the country's debt pile, as talks between European Union leaders continued in Brussels for a second consecutive day. Talks between finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund ended without a deal on Tuesday, amid disagreements on how best to reduce the country\u2019s debt to sustainable levels. Investor confidence also strengthened after the German Institute for Economic Research said that its index of business confidence improved to 101.4 in November from a reading of 100.0 the previous month, beating expectations for a decline to 99.5. The tech sector was expected to be active, amid rising optimism around Research in Motion's soon-to-be-launched BlackBerry 10 devices that will vie against Apple's iPhone and Android-based smartphones. Research in Motion shares skyrocketed 15.20% in pre-market trade.  Retailers were also likely to be in focus, after the Indian joint venture of Wal-Mart Stores suspended its chief financial officer and other employees, as it investigates alleged violations of U.S. anti-bribery laws.  Elsewhere, Pfizer said it cut the Canadian price of its Viagra erectile dysfunction drug after the Supreme Court of Canada opened the door to sales of generic versions of the drug. In the energy sector, General Electric was said to be in talks to acquire Italian defense company Avio from buyout firm Cinven, which rejected a previous offer from two private-equity funds. The news sent shares in General Electric up 0.29% pre-market. Other stocks in focus included United Natural Foods, due to post third-quarter results before the start of the U.S. trading session. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were little changed. The EURO STOXX 50 fell 0.16%, France\u2019s CAC 40 dipped 0.03%, Germany's DAX inched up 0.03%, while Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.07%. During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed 0.79%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index remained closed for a national holiday. \n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2012, "month": 11, "day": 22}

In Tokyo, the Nikkei rallied after Japan's main opposition leader and possible next prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said that the upcoming election would be about which party could boost a stagnant economy. Mazda Motor soared 7.08%, thanks to a weaker yen and a bullish note from J.P.

Mining giant Rio Tinto saw shares edged up 0.14% on the other hand, while rival BHP Billiton retreated 0.57% and Whitehaven Coal plunged 1.79% after the company announced a decision to scale back its business development unit and Brisbane presence.

Markets were also jittery after the release of disappointing U.S. data on Thursday added to concerns over the strength of the country's economic recovery. The Internet sector was expected to be active, after the Wall Street Journal reported that Google held talks with satellite-TV provider Dish Network, in recent weeks, to partner on a new wireless service that would rival the networks of wireless carriers such as AT&T and Verizon VZ Wireless. Shares in Google were down 0.37% in after-hour trade. Tech stocks were also likely to be in focus, as Dell's third-quarter profit slid 47%, hurt by lower PC sales, weaker demand from large corporations and the shift to mobile computing, sending shares 2.51% lower in pre-market trade. Elsewhere, Sears Holdings was also expected to trend lower, as shares dove 7.32 in late trading after the retailer reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss, although poor demand for popular consumer electronic products took a toll on its same-store sales. On the upside, the Gap surged 3.61% after hours, as it posted a bigger quarterly profit on Thursday and quelled fears of a possible slowdown ahead of the holiday season after raising its profit view for the year.  Other stocks in focus included Hertz Global Holdings, up 2.39% in late trading, after it won approval from U.S. antitrust regulators for its USD2.56 billion bid for smaller car rental rival Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group.

Activision Blizzard was also higher pre-market, with shares up 2.34%, after the biggest U.S. video-game maker reported better- than-estimated earnings. The company posted a 53% increase in third-quarter net income to USD226 million and said it expects fourth-quarter sales, excluding changes in deferred revenue, to reach USD2.41 billion.  Concur Technologies plunged 6.87% after hours on the other hand, although the company reported on Wednesday a narrower loss for the fourth quarter, helped mainly by a healthy revenue growth. The company also provided an outlook for the first quarter as well as the full-year 2013, which are currently above analysts' expectations.  Consumer goods companies were also likely to be in focus, Whole Foods Market tumbled 1.49% in early trading, even as fiscal fourth-quarter earnings grew 49% as the natural-foods supermarket posted stronger same-store sales and margins. Meanwhile, Mondelez, the snacks business separated from Kraft Foods Inc., saw shares drop 0.95% in after-hour trade, as it forecast profit for its next fiscal year that trailed analysts\u2019 estimates after \u201cexecutional missteps\u201d in Brazil and Russia.

Concerns over Greece re-emerged after German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble on Thursday said next week may still be too early to make a decision on granting further aid to Athens, despite a successful vote on new austerity measures. European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi praised Greece for going ahead with austerity reforms, but he said the ECB was \"by and large done\" with helping finance Greece. Meanwhile, investors remained cautious amid concerns over the U.S. fiscal cliff, automatic tax hikes and spending cuts due to come into effect on January 1 unless lawmakers can reach an agreement, which could threaten U.S. and global growth. The Internet sector was expected to be active, after Groupon's results again fell short of expectations as the daily deal company failed to turn around a struggling European business, sending its shares to a record low. The news sent shares plunging 14.80% in pre-market trade. Meanwhile, Netflix saw shares climb 0.47% after hours, when activist investor Carl Icahn said he has considered a hostile takeover bid for the Internet streaming service but was uncertain he stood a chance of acquiring the company in which he holds a 10% stake. The financial sector was also likely to be in focus, after Merrill Lynch, part of Bank of America, on Thursday lost its bid to dismiss a federal regulator's lawsuit accusing it of misleading Fannie Mae and Freddie Macinto buying billions of dollars of risky mortgage debt. In tech stocks, Nvidia added 0.32% in after-hour trade, even as it forecast revenue below expectations due to a slowdown in tablet-processor shipments and a troubled PC market.

Market sentiment slightly improved after Greece\u2019s government approved a budget of spending cuts and tax increases for next year, just days after the parliament narrowly approved a EUR13.5 billion austerity package required to secure the country\u2019s next installment of financial aid.  But markets were jittery as euro zone finance ministers were to meet in Brussels later in the day to discuss whether to release a new tranche of funding to Greece. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told a German newspaper on Sunday that the troika of international lenders to Athens was unlikely to deliver its full report in time for Monday's meeting. Financial stocks were broadly lower, as French lenders Societe Generale and BNP Paribas saw shares decline 0.49% and 0.53%, while Germany's Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank dropped 0.72% and 0.38% respectively.

Tech stocks were expected to be active, after Apple and HTC announced on Saturday a global patent settlement and 10-year licensing agreement that ends one of the first major conflagrations of the smartphone patent wars. Apple shares were up 0.56% in pre-market trade.  The Internet sector was also set to be in focus, as China's Alibaba Group more than doubled its April-June net profit and grew sales by 71% for the period, proving the country's largest e-commerce firm has shrugged off intensifying competition in the sector. Yahoo, which holds 24% of Alibaba, saw shares jump 1.68% pre-market.

But investors remained cautious as euro zone finance ministers were to meet in Brussels later in the day to discuss whether to release a new tranche of funding to Greece. Without the next aid installment, Greece risks default on November 16, when Athens must repay EUR5 billion of debts. Apple saw shares climb 0.85% after it and HTC announced on Saturday a global patent settlement and 10-year licensing agreement that ends one of the first major conflagrations of the smartphone patent wars. Meanwhile, Research In Motion said it plans to introduce its BlackBerry 10 on January 30, sending shares surging 3.51%.  In the Internet sector, China's Alibaba Group more than doubled its April-June net profit and grew sales by 71% for the period, proving the country's largest e-commerce firm has shrugged off intensifying competition in the sector. Yahoo, which holds 24% of Alibaba, saw shares advance 0.72%.  Elsewhere, oil and gas major Exxon Mobil added 0.25% after saying it faces a USD3.3 billion spike in costs at its LNG project in Papua New Guinea, the latest Asia-Pacific project to be hit by cost overruns as competition is set to grow from new gas supplies coming on tap in North America and Africa. Also on the upside, financial stocks were mostly higher, as shares in JP Morgan added 0.12% and Goldman Sachs advanced 0.59%, while Bank of America and Citigroup jumped 0.64% and 1.04% respectively. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were mixed. The EURO STOXX 50 slipped 0.13%, France\u2019s CAC 40 fell 0.24%, Germany's DAX rose 0.32%, while Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.24%. During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.21%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index dropped 0.93%.  Later Monday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel was to travel to Lisbon to hold talks with Portuguese political leaders, amid public opposition to the country\u2019s austerity cuts. \n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2012, "month": 11, "day": 12}

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.32% rise, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.34% gain, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.51% increase. Investors remained cautious ahead of the start of voting in the U.S. presidential elections, with opinion polls pointing to a tight race between incumbent President Barack Obama and Republican contender Mitt Romney. Markets were also jittery ahead of Wednesday\u2019s parliamentary vote in Greece on new austerity measures required for Athens to get its next round of international aid. On Monday, European Union Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs Olli Rehn said the euro zone was on track to make a decision on unlocking Greece\u2019s next installment of financial aid at a meeting of the bloc\u2019s finance ministers next week.  Carmakers were expected to be active after Nissan Motor cut its full-year net profit forecast by 20%, although it posted a better than expected 3-month net profit. Shares in General Motors dropped 0.38% in after-hour trade.  Children's toymaker LeapFrog Enterprises was also likely to be in focus, after it raised its full-year forecast and said it will increase its advertising spending to attract more shoppers during the holiday season, sending shares up 4.49% after hours. In the pharmaceutical sector, Abbott Laboratories was slated to move after it reportedly sold USD14.7 billion of bonds on Monday in the largest dollar-denominated offering in more than three years as the drug and medical-device maker prepares to split in two.  Elsewhere, real estate website Zillow forecast fourth-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates after it lost one of its larger advertisers, Foreclosure.com, sending the company's shares diving 19.99% in pre-market trading.  Other stocks in focus included Cablevision, CVS Caremark Corp and News Corp, due to report earnings later in the day. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were higher. The EURO STOXX 50 climbed 0.73%, France\u2019s CAC 40 advanced 0.76%, Germany's DAX rose 0.66%, while Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.65%.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.02% loss, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.02% gain, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.02% rise. Sentiment slightly weakened after Markit research group earlier said that Spain's manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell more-than-expected in October, ticking down to 43.5 from a reading 0f 44.6 the previous month. Analysts had expected the manufacturing PMI to fall to 44.0 in October. Separately, Italy's manufacturing PMI fell to 45.50 last month, from 45.70 in September, disappointing expectations for a reading of 45.90. Meanwhile, investors remained cautious amid uncertainty over when Spain may request a bailout and whether Greece will secure the next tranche of its bailout funding. The Internet sector was expected to be active for the second consecutive session, after professional social network LinkedIn Corp beat Wall Street's third-quarter profit and revenue targets, as advertising rates increased and sales from its hiring services nearly doubled. The news sent shares in LinkedIn up 9.42% in pre-market trade. Meanwhile, Yelp, the website that lets users review businesses ranging from lounges to locksmiths, reported third-quarter sales that matched analysts\u2019 estimates, as the company benefited from overseas expansion sending shares up 1.42% pre-market.  Elsewhere, Starbucks was likely to be in focus after it raised its profit forecast for the current fiscal year, as sales in its top market of the U.S. beat expectations, giving the company optimism that has eluded much of the U.S. restaurant industry in recent months. Shares surged 7.25% in early trading.  In commodity-linked stocks, Newmont Mining tumbled 1.35% in after-hour trade, as the company reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit after a steep fall in production and a sharp rise in costs at its big Batu Hijau copper and gold mine in Indonesia.  Other stocks in focus included media group McGraw-Hill, Chevron, energy company Hess Corp and fashion group Ralph Lauren, all due to report quarterly earnings later in the day. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were moderately lower. The EURO STOXX 50 slipped 0.07%, France\u2019s CAC 40 fell 0.16%, Germany's DAX dipped 0.03%, while Britain's FTSE 100 inched 0.08% lower. During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged 1.33%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index jumped 1.17%.  Later in the day, the U.S. was to produce a government report on nonfarm payrolls, as well as data on the unemployment rate, followed by official data on average earnings and factory orders.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2012, "month": 11, "day": 1}

Markets were jittery amid uncertainty over the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s U.S. presidential elections, with opinion polls indicating a dead heat between President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Meanwhile, concerns over Spain's financial woes re-emerged after the country's Employment Ministry said the number of unemployed people rose by a seasonally adjusted 128,200 in October, above expectations for an increase of 90,500. The number of unemployed people in Spain rose by an unrevised 79,600 in September.  The financial sector was expected to be active, amid reports International Lease Finance Corp, the aircraft leasing arm of American International Group, shrugged off threats from a growing number of domestic players in China, its biggest single market, saying it has the \"first mover\" advantage with more than 200 planes on order.  Separately, Goldman Sachs said it cut the number of employees it lists as partners to help streamline expenses. Elsewhere, drilling contractor Transocean saw shares jump 1.82% in pre-market trade, after it reported a higher-than-expected adjusted profit for the third quarter as it made more efficient use of the world's largest offshore oil drilling fleet. Comcast and Amgen were also likely to be in focus, as they were reportedly preparing to ask the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to further limit class actions following a decision last year in the landmark Wal-Mart Stores discrimination case that restricted such group litigation.

During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.41%, the S&P 500 index advanced 0.36%, while the Nasdaq Composite index slid 0.29%. Data showed that manufacturing activity in the Chicago area contracted for the second consecutive month in October. Market research group Kingsbury International said its Chicago purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to 49.9 in October from a reading of 49.7 the previous month. Analysts had expected the index to improve to 50.0 in October. Sentiment stregnthened earlier after Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said earlier that his country needs the help of the European Union to meet its budget goals, and added that EU progress on a banking union would allow leeway on making a formal request for aid. Auto stocks were active, as Ford Motor surged 4.46% after saying on Tuesday that it posted a better-than-expected profit in the third quarter. Ford reported USD2.3 billion pretax profit in North America, its best performance since the company began reporting separate North American results 12 years ago. General Motors also added to gains, with shares rallying 3.99% after the automaker posted better-than-expected earnings and said it was targeting a return to breakeven levels in its money-losing European operations by mid-decade. In the tech sector, Advanced Micro Devices jumped 2.66% after introducing a new line of faster, more energy-efficient processors for handsets and to expand in the server market dominated by competitor Intel. Elsewhere, Home Depot saw shares advance 3.23% after announcing that it successfully closed the merger of U.S. Home Systems, Inc. The deal has been valued at approximately USD95.0 million and is expected to help build a better relationship with the customers by providing them improved home services. Also on the upside, U.S. lenders tracked their European counterparts higher, as shares in JP Morgan rose 0.39% and Bank of America climbed 0.88%, while Citigroup and Goldman Sachs surged 1.17% and 1.56% respectively.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.74% drop, S&P 500 futures signaled a declined 0.75% , while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.65% slump. Gloomy earnings and outlook statements from global giants such as Apple and Amazon, and European firms Renault and Gucci have steadily corroded the hopes of a recovery in the global economy. Investors wanted to see that recovery confirmed by the U.S. gross domestic product data, especially with uncertainty growing over the budget problems in Washington, known as the fiscal cliff, which could depress business activity early next year. Markets were also jittery amid ongoing uncertainty over when Spain will request a bailout and trigger the European Central Bank's bond-buying programme.  Tech stocks were expected to be active, after Apple delivered a second straight quarter of disappointing results and iPad sales fell well short of Wall Street's targets, sending shares down only 0.09% in pre-market trade.  The consumer goods sector was also likely to be in focus, amid reports Dean Foods Co's Morningstar business has attracted takeover interest from Michael Foods and Mexican dairy company Grupo Lala. According to Reuters, the deal could be valued in the USD1 billion to USD1.5 billion range.  Separately, Wal-Mart Stores said it plans to open 100 more stores in China and create 18,000 jobs there over the next three years, in a bid to boost its presence in China's booming but highly competitive hypermarket sector.  Elsewhere, Amazon.com Inc saw shares tumbled 1.30% pre-market, after the company reported its first quarterly net loss in more than five years on Thursday, as the world's largest Internet retailer spent heavily and suffered from an economic slowdown in Europe. Other stocks in focus included Comcast and Merck, due to report earnings before the bell on Friday. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were lower. The EURO STOXX 50 dropped 0.46%, France\u2019s CAC 40 declined 0.40%, Germany's DAX retreated 0.48%, while Britain's FTSE 100 slumped 0.68%. During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled 1.21%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index plunged 1.35%.  Later in the day, the U.S. was to release preliminary data on third quarter gross domestice product. In addition, the University of Michigan was to release revised data on consumer sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2012, "month": 10, "day": 25}

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.48% rise, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.62% increase, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.69% gain. In its rate statement on Wednesday, the Fed said the U.S. economy is improving moderately, but said job growth has been slow and the unemployment rate remains elevated.The central bank also said it planned to keep its benchmark short-term rate close to zero through mid-2015.Investors remained cautious however amid ongoing uncertainty over whether Spain is moving closer to formally requesting a bailout from its euro zone partners and activating the European Central Bank\u2019s bond purchasing plan.  Food stocks were expected to be active, after global consumer goods group Unilever beat expectations with a 5.9% rise in underlying quarterly sales thanks to strong demand from emerging markets. Shares were up 4.79% in pre-market trade. The advertising sector was also likely to be in focus after WPP, the world's largest advertising group, cut its revenue outlook for the second time in as many months, due to a sharp slowdown in September in North America and Continental Europe.  In the tech sector, Symantec reported results ahead of Wall Street expectations, sending shares up 10.47% pre-market, as the company's new chief executive took direct control of the company's sales force as part of an effort to turn around the maker of security software.  Separately, a U.S. trade panel judge said in a preliminary decision issued on Wednesday that South Korea's Samsung Electronics, the world's top maker of smartphones, infringed Apple patents to make its smartphones and tablets.  Elsewhere, Ford was set to announce later Thursday that it is closing its van factory at Southampton, ending more than a century of vehicle production by the company in the U.K. Meanwhile, General Motors reportedly said it plans to enter talks to buy a stake in its South Korean unit from the unit's second-biggest shareholder, Korea Development Bank.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.27% rise, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.35% increase, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.32% gain. Sentiment remained under pressure after preliminary data showed that manufacturing activity in the euro zone contracted at a faster-rate-than-expected in October, shrinking for the 14th consecutive month. Markit said that its preliminary manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index fell to a seasonally adjusted 45.3 in October from a final reading of 46.1 in September. Analysts had expected the index to ease up to 46.6 in October. A separate report showed that German business confidence in October deteriorated to the lowest level since March 2010. The chemical sector was expect to be active after Dupont warned that demand would be weaker going forward. Shares were down 0.22% in pre-market trade.  Separately, Chemical Co, the largest chemical maker in the U.S., said on Tuesday it plans to cut 5% of its workforce and shut 20 plants as part of a restructuring program aimed at countering a slowing global economy. Elsewhere, Facebook saw shares surge 16.82% pre-market, after the social media giant reported on Tuesday that sales rose 32% to USD1.26 billion in the third quarter, compared with the average estimate of USD1.23 billion. Also in the Internet field, social-game maker Zynga said it will cut 5% of its workforce, shut offices and end more than a dozen titles to compensate for slowing sales growth. The news sent shares climbing 5.45% in early trading. Netflix, the world\u2019s largest online video service, plunged 16.37% on the other hand, as domestic streaming growth missed analysts\u2019 projections. Other stocks in focus included Boeing,AT&T, Kimberly-Clark and Bristol-Myers Squibb, all due to report earnings later in the day. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were higher. The EURO STOXX 50 climbed 0.43%, France\u2019s CAC 40 advanced 0.45%, Germany's DAX rose 0.30%, while Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.22%. During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.31%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index dropped 0.67%. Also Wednesday, data showed that China's HSBC manufacturing purchasing managers' index came in at 49.1 in October, compared with a final reading of 47.9 in September. Later in the day, the Federal Reserve was to announce its benchmark interest rate and release its first monetary policy statement since the central bank announced a third round of quantitative easing in September. The U.S. was to release official data on new home sales.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2012, "month": 10, "day": 24}

Elsewhere, Boeing jumped 1.48% after it posted earnings that topped expectations and revenue that matched forecasts. In addition, the company lifted its forecast for the full year. Fellow Dow component AT&T was on the downside however, with shares dropping 0.57% even as the company reported a profit that beat expectations, helped by strong revenue from its wireless operations.

Market sentiment remained supported after official data showed that the Chinese economy expanded by 7.4% in the three months to October, matching economists' forecasts.The data came one day after a report showing that U.S. housing starts rose by 15% in September, the fastest pace since July 2008, adding to hopes that the U.S. economic recovery is gaining momentum.Investors were also looking ahead to the start of a two-day European Union summit, although no major announcements on Spain or Greece were expected.  Verizon Communications was expected to be active after reporting results early Thursday, posting revenue that was slightly above expectations. The company also said that it was on track to meet its 2012 goals.

In the mining sector, Gold Resource plunged 13% pre-market, after the company lowered its full-year production outlook to a range of 85,000 ounces to 100,000 ounces of the so-called gold equivalent which includes silver. In July, the company said it expects 2012 production of 100,000 ounces to 120,000 ounces of gold equivalent. Elsewhere, medical-devices company Stryker was slated to moce, after Oppenheimer & Co. downgraded the shares to market-perform, the equivalent of hold, from outperform.

In the tech sector, Intel shares plunged 3.09% and IBM dove 3.92% on signs the global economic slowdown is prompting companies to curtail technology spending and pushing consumers to favor mobile devices like Apple's iPhone over personal computers.

Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.38% rise, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.50% increase, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.66% gain. Sentiment improved after official data over the weekend showed that China's trade surplus widened in September as export demand increased, easing concerns over a slowdown in the world\u2019s second largest economy. But investors remained cautious as Madrid did not request financial aid over the weekend and a request for a bailout is now seen as increasingly unlikely ahead of regional elections on October 21.  Financial stocks were expected to be active, as Citigroup was to announce results later in the day, following Friday's earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, which sparked concerns over shrinking profit margins for big lenders despite both reporting stronger-than-expected profits. In the tech sector, Sprint saw shares jump 2.62% in pre-market trade on reports Japan's Softbank reached a deal to buy 70% of the U.S. mobile carrier for USD20.1 billion in the largest ever foreign acquisition by a Japanese company. Meanwhile, Amazon.com was said to be in advanced talks to buy the mobile chip business of Texas Instruments, sending the latter's shares up 1.50% in early trading. Apple was also likely to move higher, with shares climbing 0.54% pre-market, even as SNS Securities said the company could improve its iPhone maps function in a deal with TomTom. TomTom signed an agreement with the iPhone maker in June to supply maps information. Separately, Apple appealed a Tokyo District Court ruling that Samsung Electronics didn't infringe the iPhone maker's patents. Advanced Micro Devices also gained ground in early trading, as shares surged 2.19%, despite reports the company plans to cut as many as 2,340 jobs, or about 20% of its workforce. Last week, the firm said that third-quarter sales will decline about 10% from the prior period, a bigger drop than previously forecast. Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were higher. The EURO STOXX 50 jumped 1.13%, France\u2019s CAC 40 surged 1.33%, Germany's DAX rallied 0.79%, while Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.53%.

But concerns over the worsening of the euro zone's debt crisis re-emerged after top economists slashed their growth forecasts for Germany on Thursday, and warned that public support for financial aid for struggling countries was evaporating. In Tokyo, the Nikkei edged lower amid global growth concerns and after government data earlier showed that tertiary industry activity in Japan rose less-than-expected in August, ticking up 0.4% after a 1.9% decline the previous month. Samsung Electronics fell 0.60%, earsing earlier gains posted after A U.S. appeals court overturned a pretrial sales ban against the South-Korean compan's Galaxy Nexus smartphone.

Elsewhere, Australian shares inched higher, lifted by gains in mining stocks. Mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton advanced 1.77% and 0.87% respectively.

Market sentiment remained under pressure after the International Monetary Fund cut global economic growth forecasts for 2012 and 2013 on Tuesday, justifying the recent round of central bank stimulus which aimed to support to the world's fragile economies. Earlier in the day, the IMF said the crisis in the euro zone remains the greatest threat to the global economy and warned that policymakers need to urgently strengthen fiscal and financial ties within the euro area. Markets were also jittery amid uncertainty over when Spain will request a sovereign bailout and when Greece will agree with its international lenders on terms for the next tranche of funds.  Alcoa was expected to be in focus, after the aluminum giant kicked off earnings season late on Tuesday, posting a quarterly profit before exceptional items that beat analyst expectations, but warning about a \"slight slowdown\" in some regions and end markets. The news sent shares tumbling 0.99% in after-hour trade.  Oil and gas major Chevron was also likely to be in the spotlight, as shares plunged 1.26% pre-market after the company said that third-quarter profits would be \"substantially lower\" than the previous quarter's, as a hurricane and maintenance curbed its oil and gas output and a fire hit its refining arm.  In the retail sector, Costco Wholesale added 0.27% in early trading, after posting a 27% jump in fourth quarter profit, as sales continued to rise and it got a lift from higher membership fees.  Also on the upside, Yum Brands surged 4.47% pre-market, after raising its full-year outlook late on Tuesday, with sales in China holding up despite a cooling of economic growth in that market, the company's largest.  Elsewhere, FedEx was expected to be active after saying on Tuesday it plans to sharply cut costs at its underperforming express air freight and services divisions, seeking to improve profits at those operations by USD1.7 billion over the next four years.

During late Asian trade, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed 0.58%, Australia\u2019s ASX/200 Index jumped 0.94%, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index advanced 0.44%.  Speaking at the ECB's post-policy meeting press conference, Draghi said the central bank was ready to undertake Outright Monetary Transactions when the prerequisites are in place and reiterated that the ECB was acting strictly within its mandate in undertaking a bond buying program via OMTs.The ECB left rates on hold at a record low 0.75% earlier, in a widely anticipated decision.  Meanwhile, the minutes of the Federal Reserve's September policy meeting showed that the central bank is moving toward linking its outlook for near-zero interest rates to specific economic conditions such as a decline in the unemployment rate.  The move would represent a shift from the Fed\u2019s policy of tying low rates to the calendar.  Earlier in the day, the BoJ ended a two-day policy meeting by holding the benchmark interest rate close to zero, in a widely expected move.  The central bank held off from more easing after adding to stimulus last month, keeping its asset-purchase fund at JPY55 trillion, despite increased political pressure and signs of an economic contraction. In Tokyo, the Nikkei was higher following the BoJ announcement, boosted by gains in commodity-linked stocks. Nippon Steel jumped 1.28% and Japan Steel Works climbed 0.92%, while Toyota Motor tumbled 1.62% on the other hand, amid reports the automaker's sales in China dropped by about 40% in September from a year earlier to about 50,000 cars. Elsewhere, optics and imaging giant Nikon plunged 4.81% after the Nikkei newspaper said its interim operating profit would drop 43% on the year to JPY35 billion, signaling a slowdown in sales. Meanwhile, shares in Hong Kong advanced as oil-related stocks posted sharp gains. PetroChina surged 2.10% and China Shenua rallied 1.34%, while Sinopec soared 8.08%, on the back of rising oil prices. Meanwhile, Swire Properties added 0.26%, even as weak retail sales data pointed to lower spending by Chinese tourists. Elsewhere, Australian shares were lifted by mining and banking stocks. Mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton advanced 1.76% and 1% respectively, while Newcrest Mining rallied 3.12% after the gold price soared to its highest price in 11 months. In the financial sector, National Australia Bank gained 0.60%, while ANZ Banking and Westpac Banking climbed 0.79% and 1.21% respectively Looking ahead, European stock futures pointed to a higher open, following Mario Draghi's comments on Thursday. The EURO STOXX 50 futures pointed to a 0.54% gain, France\u2019s CAC 40 futures added l 0.10%, London\u2019s FTSE 100 futures rose 0.37%, while Germany's DAX futures pointed to a 0.32% gain. Later in the day, Germany was to release a report on factory orders, while the euro zone was to publish release final data on economic growth.The U.S. was to produce official data on non-farm payrolls and the unemployment rate, as well as a report on average hourly earnings.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2012, "month": 10, "day": 4}

During European morning trade, the EURO STOXX 50 fell 0.18%, France\u2019s CAC 40 dropped 0.34%, while Germany\u2019s DAX 30 edged down 0.10%.  Risk sentiment weakened after Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Tuesday ruled out a bailout request before this weekend, despite persistent speculation that Madrid was moving closer to requesting external financial aid.Separately, Moody's said it would announce the results of its review o Spain's sovereign debt rating some time this month, easing concerns over an imminent downgrade.  Meanwhile, official data showing that growth in China\u2019s service sector moderated in September sparked fresh concerns over a slowdown in the world\u2019s second largest economy.  Financial stocks were mixed, as shares in French lenders Societe Generale and BNP Paribas decline 0.58% and 0.11%, while Germany saw Deutsche Bank jump 1.39% and Commerzbank drop 0.97%.

During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.35%, the S&P 500 index advanced 0.39%, while the Nasdaq Composite index added 0.23%.  Official data showed that the U.S. gross domestic product increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.3% during the second quarter, down from a previous estimate of 1.7%. Analysts had expected the U.S. economy to grow at a rate of 1.7%.  A separate report showed that total durable goods orders sank by a seasonally adjusted 13.2% in August, compared to expectations for a 5.0% decline, after climbing at a revised rate of 3.3% in July.  In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending September 22 fell by 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 359,000, compared to expectations for a decrease of 7,000 to 378,000.  Meanwhile, investors remained cautious as Spain\u2019s government was due to unveil its draft budget statement for 2013, amid ongoing speculation over whether Madrid will seek a full-scale sovereign bailout, which would trigger the European Central Bank\u2019s bond buying program. Auto stocks were higher, led by Ford Motor, up 1%, as the biannual Paris Motor Show kicked off on Wednesday, with carmakers eager to show off the latest technologies to help them compete in a market that is looking increasingly crowded. General Motors rose 0.30% at the U.S. open. According to recent reports, European car sales slipped by 8.6% in the first eight months of the year, due to the effects of the euro zone's debt crisis. Ford saw European sales drop by 29% over the same period. In the tech sector, Hewlett-Packard dropped 0.58% after Jefferies cut its rating on the tech giant to \"underperform\" from \"hold\" and lowered its target to USD14 from USD17. In company news, Hartford rallied 2.57% after the Wall Street Journal reported that Prudential is near an agreement to buy the financial services company's individual life insurance division. Also on the upside, Starbucks rose 0.34%, as the world\u2019s largest coffee-shop operator was is preparing to open its first city-center stores in Sweden and Norway next year, with hopes of boosting sales in Europe. Elsewhere, U.S. lenders were broadly higher. Shares in JP Morgan added 0.10% and Citigroup rose 0.28%, while Goldman Sachs and Bank of America advanced 0.75% and 1.93% respectively.

The EURO STOXX 50 advanced 0.44%, France\u2019s CAC 40 climbed 0.68%, Germany's DAX rose 0.32%, while Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.21%.  During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 1.14%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index rose 0.48%.  Also Thursday, stocks strengthened amid reports the People\u2019s Bank of China injected a record CNY365 billion, or USD58 billion, this week into the Chinese banking system, easing liquidity conditions ahead of the end of the current quarter and before the Golden Week holidays next week.

The share was initially priced at USD38 a share as part of the initial public offering that valued the company around USD104 billion. Stocks were up overall as well. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was trading up 0.02% on Friday, the S&P 500 index was up 0.14% while the Nasdaq Composite index was down 0.01%. Demand for Facebook was heavy, with an estimated 15-25% of the pie seen going to retail investors, according to CNBC data. The price was trading in line with many expectations. \"A 15 to 20 percent pop is in the realm of possibility,\" said Tim Loughran, a finance professor at the University of Notre Dame, according to Reuters.  \"Given they already moved their IPO range up and increased the size, that's bullish to begin with.\" Facebook shares could see some selling in about three months, when the lock-up expires. Normally when companies go public, they require investors to hang on to stocks not sold in the IPO for six months, though Facebook is ending the period in only three months \u2014 91 days to be exact, according to company filings at the Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. stock market regulator. In early U.S. trading, leading Nasdaq gainers included Yahoo!, up 5.38%, Joy Global, up 4.08%, and Wynn Resorts, up 3.99%. Leading Nasdaq losers included Autodesk, down 15.55%, First Solar, down 3.89%, and Seagate Technology, down 2.65%. Leading Dow Jones Industrial Average gainers included Caterpillar, up 1.70%, McDonald's Corp., up 1.44%, and Wal-Mart Stores, up 1.28% Leading index losers included Coca-Cola, down 1.73%, JPMorgan, down 1.47%, and Hewlett-Packard, down 0.86%.

Agile Property Holdings soared 7.8%, Evergrande Real Estate Group jumped 4.1%, while shares in China Overseas Land & Investment rose 3.3%.The biggest gainer on the index was Alibaba.com Limited, which soared 42.7%, as it resumed trading for the first time since February 9, after its parent company Alibaba Group Holding bid as much as HKD19.6 billion to buy out minority shareholders and take the company private.But weakness in Hong Kong-based capped any significant gains. Shares in Esprit Holdings dropped 2.4%, Li & Fung shares retreated 3.3%, while computer-maker Lenovo Group slumped 1.8%.Elsewhere, the Nikkei closed above the 9,500-level for the first time since August on the back of a broadly weaker yen.Japanese exporters led gains, boosted by the outlook for export earnings. Consumer electronics giant Sony rose 1.5%, while automakers Toyota and Nissan added 1.8% and 2.2% respectively.Japan\u2019s largest mobile-phone operator by market value NTT DoCoMo gained 2.05% on a report that it expanded capacity to prevent service glitches.Looking ahead, the outlook for European stock markets was mildly upbeat. The EURO STOXX 50 futures pointed to a gain of 0.1%, France\u2019s CAC 40 futures added 0.1%, London\u2019s FTSE 100 futures eased up 0.1%, while Germany's DAX futures pointed to a 0.15% gain.Later in the day, the euro zone was to release preliminary data on manufacturing and service sector activity, followed by official data on industrial new orders.In the U.S., industry data was to be released on existing home sales as well as official data on crude oil stockpiles.\n\n\n\n\n", "year": 2012, "month": 2, "day": 21}
