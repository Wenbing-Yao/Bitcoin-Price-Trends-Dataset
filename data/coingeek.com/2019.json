McCormack has very publicly accused Wright of being a fraud for maintaining that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous identity behind the development and public release of Bitcoin technology.Last week, Wright\u2019s attorneys filed their particulars of claim against McCormack in the UK High Court of Justice, Queen\u2019s Bench Division. The document cites numerous examples of McCormack\u2019s official Twitter account calling Wright a fraud, initially in response to tweets from CoinGeek founder Calvin Ayre, who announced that Wright had begun taking legal action against individuals denying his Satoshi claims.McCormack proceeded to publicly invite Wright to pursue legal action against him, going as far as to publish a physical address to which legal documents could be sent. McCormack also encouraged his Twitter followers to retweet his accusations that Wright was (a) not Satoshi and (b) a fraud for claiming so.McCormack only doubled down from there, publicly \u2018demanding\u2019 a lawsuit be filed against him, while accusing Ayre of \u201cjust trying to bully people into silence with empty threats.\u201d When McCormack was served with legal papers from Wright\u2019s attorneys, McCormack tweeted that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d rejected the requirements specified in the correspondence, although he recommended that others not follow his lead.McCormack also claimed that Wright was a fraud for \u201cpromoting a fake version of bitcoin.\u201d That allegedly \u2018fake\u2019 version McCormack describes would be Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV), which Wright and Ayre support as the only blockchain-based technology with the on-chain scaling capacity required to become a truly global payment platform.In an April 16th interview with BlockTV.com, McCormack stated that he hopes the value of BSV \u201cgoes to zero\u201d and urged investors to ditch their BSV holdings before that devaluation occurs and buy into Bitcoin Segwit Coin (BTC), the technology that McCormack publicly supports.In the same interview, McCormack stated that if Wright were to sign a message from the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s Genesis block, it would give \u201cquite a substantial amount of credibility\u201d to Wright\u2019s Satoshi claims.But McCormack also stated that Wright signing such a transaction \u201cdoes not prove [Wright\u2019s claims] to me\u201d and making an analogy in which McCormack might \u201csteal my neighbor\u2019s keys and drive their car \u2026 and claim it\u2019s mine. But it\u2019s not my car; I stole the keys.\u201dIn other words, McCormack is daring Wright to provide evidence that supports his Satoshi claims while simultaneously admitting that this evidence wouldn\u2019t change McCormack\u2019s mind. McCormack appears to be hedging his bet so that he can claim to have emerged victorious regardless of how the case proceeds in court.McCormack also stated that Satoshi\u2019s true identity \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter\u201d and that, were this individual to emerge publicly without the Satoshi mask, his influence on the current cryptocurrency sector would be minimal.Here again, McCormack appears to be hedging his bets, undoubtedly with the knowledge that the general public\u2019s interest in Satoshi\u2019s identity would offer the individual behind that alias a major public platform to influence the crypto sector\u2019s future.And if this Satoshi were to publicly declare that BSV is the only technology that honors the vision of Bitcoin laid out in Satoshi\u2019s 2008 white paper, that would spell problems for the likes of BTC. So McCormack\u2019s claims that he has \u2018nothing to gain\u2019 from his attacks on Wright appear as accurate as his claims that Wright is a fraud.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

The work he has done on DACs was impressive enough to see Wright receive the \u201cBest Paper\u201d award at the ICICT and an edited version of his presentation is now available for viewing on YouTube.\u00a0It\u2019s a truly fascinating subject and one that should open the eyes of business owners and virtually everyone, regardless of industry. A DAC can be defined as a type of single corporation that spans multiple locations simultaneously; if one location or business point fails, the operations can continue without interruption.DACs offer the ability to create organizational structures that make optimal use of autonomous agents, artificial intelligence and other advanced technology. These technologies eliminate failure points and allow for the automatic implementation of certain policies and procedures in order to ensure their authenticity at all times.An autonomous agent is a computer system that is located in a certain environment, such as the Internet, and which is capable of autonomous actions in the environment in order to meet its design objectives. It is purely software that can receive and execute instructions, but cannot manufacture products, code or develop hardware.The agents work through secure multiparty computation (SMC) protocols. These allow a group of mutually distrusting parties to compute a joint function on their private inputs. They also provide a threshold group to safeguard confidential information.If it sounds like the idea is to create robotic industries, nothing could be further from the truth. On the contrary, the goal of DAC systems and autonomous agents is to put the control back in the hands of the people. As with all blockchain data and programs, every process, step, policy, contract and negotiating strategy is stored immutably. There can never be a question about the authenticity of the details surround a particular event, because all of the details are forever and indelibly engraved in the blockchain.This ultimately means that individuals will have the control. There wouldn\u2019t be a question over the legitimacy of a legal claim or of a news article, because everything is registered and visible on the blockchain.Blockchain technology has begun to receive a significantly higher amount of attention and this is undoubtedly going to continue as it continues to prove itself. As further adoption occurs, DACs could potentially be the future of business.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

We\u2019re 10 years in and Bitcoin is now starting to exhibit the properties that it was designed to exhibit. So its almost like a second birth of Bitcoin,\u201d Shadders told CoinGeek.com.In addition to educating delegates on the latest in Bitcoin, events like Bitcoin London\u2019s casual meet-ups are important for nurturing the Bitcoin ecosystem and creating a sense of physical comradery in an otherwise digital setting.\u201cWe just really want to be with people and network with people. At the CoinGeek Conference we met so many intelligent people, people that are building, people that are passionate. I just love being around people that are passionate about Bitcoin,\u201d shared Meet-up speaker $marquee Mark Allison, Enterprise Software Architect.How to engage \u201cregular people\u201d in everyday Bitcoin use was another topic of discussion on the night, covered by Rafa Jim\u00e9nez, Co-Founder of Handcash. Jim\u00e9nez explained the philosophy behind HandCash wallet development and how they strive to create wallets that the \u201caverage Joe\u201d can easily use.\u201cThe biggest thing that we found when we arrived to the ecosystem was to improve the backups, improve the way that we can send money to other people and having local currency [displayed], what the people are using to having. These were our biggest hypotheses at the beginning of the project,\u201d Jim\u00e9nez shared.Bitcoin London\u2019s Darren Eggenschwiler served as the evening\u2019s moderator and also took an active role in the overall organization of the meet-up, a unique opportunity to match names to faces.\u201cPutting something in a physical location makes it kind of real, right? I have a lot of internet friends\u2014a lot of people here have a lot of internet friends\u2014that develops the community in one way, but we\u2019re developing the community at a location in person. Its different face to face, its better,\u201d said Eggenschwiler.\u201cI think its important that we develop small communities all over the world that foster BSV building and BSV friend-making. I\u2019m here to make friends and business partners and we\u2019re going to build the future,\u201d he added.For those who want to take part in the building of BSV\u2019s future, the next opportunity to make a difference is May 29-30 in Toronto at the CoinGeek Conference. The benefits of massive on-chain scaling for businesses, developers, miners, consumers and more will be covered and anyone interested in learning more about BSV and the Satoshi Vision is welcome.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

The transition to a Bitcoin-based contract is the next logical progression for legal agreements, just as we have previously witnessed changes to authorize the use of electronic signatures, email communication and more in legal and binding contracts. However, Bitcoin is able to dramatically alter the legal scope of contracts and adherence because it provides permanent records that can never be altered, can never be forged and can never be lost.If Bitcoin contracts had been around before Bernie Madoff or Enron, billions of dollars of investors\u2019 funds could have been saved. The financial ruin brought about by both was made possible because of the ability to maintain\u2014and cook\u2014separate financial accountability records, with Madoff at one time having as many as eight. Depending on whom he was speaking with, a separate record was presented.There have been cases in the past where the courts have determined that even simple back-and-forth communication through email is enough to justify the legitimacy of an agreement to the point that it could be considering a legal contract. According to the UK Interpretations Act of 1978, \u201cin writing\u201d is defined as \u201cTyping, printing, lithography, photography and other modes of representing or reproducing words in a visible form and expressions referring to writing are construed accordingly.\u201d This means that any communication that is verifiable in court can be used to validate a contract between two parties.This is certainly possible with Bitcoin and, in particular, the use of OP_RETURN codes in a transaction. These codes allow the inclusion of text that can be mutually-agreed upon by both parties in a contract, and, with the inclusion of a digital signature, enable a binding and legal contract once uploaded to the blockchain.Wallets already exist to easily facilitate this capability. Both HandCash and CentBee allow a link between a transaction\u2019s identity and a signature and, as soon as a transaction is initiated, it becomes a part of the permanent Bitcoin history.Given that Bitcoin can legitimately cover all the requirements for a contract as established by current laws, there\u2019s no need for new legislation\u2014the technology is flexible enough to meet the laws as they\u2019re now written. This will ultimately make it simpler during the transition from current legal contract parameters to what is coming, a blockchain-based legal system that is more efficient and immutable.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

And this will enable the technology to play a greater role in autonomous systems and processes at a global scale.Early this year, Dr. Wright was awarded \u2018best paper\u2019 at the 2019 International Congress on Information and Communication Technology (ICICT) for his work on decentralized autonomous corporations. He presented the paper in a lecture at Brunel University in London, titled \u2018A Proof of Turing Completeness in Bitcoin Script\u2019 as part of the event.In the presentation, he explained that Bitcoin was incredibly efficient as a Turing complete machine. Dr. Wright said Bitcoin follows Turing\u2019s idea of a simple alphabet that acts as a predicate, which can be looped as required to perform desired functions.Dr. Wright said that the 1MB limit imposed by Bitcoin Core ignores the original focus of Bitcoin, and artificially limits these capabilities. When the artificial limits are removed, Bitcoin can perform as intended, including running more complex functions, which he said will enable Bitcoin to fulfill its true potential at mass scale.In the next 10 years, Dr. Wright expects Bitcoin will move to 3 billion transactions per second and beyond, which makes the platform ideally suited to mass consumer payments and beyond.In a subsequent presentation delivered at the University of Oxford on smart contracts and written agreements, Dr. Wright went further, arguing that Bitcoin will soon operate as a platform for commercial contracts and written agreements, offering independent, autonomous and immutable proof of agreement between contracting parties.In particular, he points to the case of convicted fraudster Bernie Madoff, who kept multiple different versions of \u2018cooked\u2019 accounts in order to defraud investors\u2014a practice which would have been impossible if agreements were handled by bitcoin at the time, as a result of the need for consensus and the immutability of bitcoin records.He said that with OP_RETURN transactions, agreements in writing between two parties can be given legal effect on an agreed basis, demonstrable in court as an enforceable written agreement.Dr. Wright, has proven beyond a doubt to ownership of CoinGeek that he was the main architect of Bitcoin, and that it was he who conceived and used the pseudonymous name of Satoshi Nakamoto, has said that only Bitcoin SV allows this functionality, which echoes the intention of the original Bitcoin white paper.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

The firm announced the discovery on Twitter, urging their users to be extra vigilant. The announcement read:\u201cWARNING: we\u2019ve detected a malware that locally replaces the Ledger Live desktop application by a malicious one. Users of infected computers are asked to enter their 24-word recovery phrase after a fake update.\u201dLedger further revealed that from its research, the malware was highly targeted, only infecting Windows machines. It had also not spread widely at the time of the announcement, only being detected on one computer. To be safe, Ledger users must not give their recovery phrase to anyone, the firm advised, \u201cIt cannot compromise your device or your crypto. It\u2019s only a phishing attempt tricking you in entering your 24 words (never do that).\u201dLedger assured its users that it has designed its wallets to withstand such attacks. They wrote, \u201cHardware wallets have been designed to protect crypto assets against this kind of attacks. Funds are safe unless users themselves give their recovery phrase to the hacker (through social trickery). Education of users is paramount to mitigate this.\u201dPreviously, the Paris-based startup issued guidelines that its users must stick to to protect themselves from such an attack. In its blog post, it warned users against ever giving their 24-word recovery phrase to anyone, even the firm itself. This phrase is meant to enable a user to recover their cryptos in the case of loss or destruction of the physical wallet. It also enables the user to clone the wallet onto a new device, giving them more freedom.Ledger users should also never store their recovery phrase on a computer or smartphone as hackers can easily compromise these devices.The firm has been immensely successful and has been earmarked to become Europe\u2019s first crypto unicorn. In 2017, the firm sold over one million devices, posting more than $25 million in profit. Its success has brought many investors on board including Samsung\u2019s venture capital arm, Siemens, Boost VC and the Digital Currency Group.The current malware isn\u2019t the first time Ledger\u2019s security has been called into question. Last year, a teen digital security expert, Saleem Rashid, reported on his blog that he had unearthed a critical flaw with Ledger\u2019s wallet. According to Rashid, malicious actors could exploit the flaw to steal users\u2019 crypto holdings. Ledger dismissed his claims, but went on to release an update.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

In a recent press release, the Bitcoin Association have announced the Bitcoin SV Scaling Test Network (STN) is now open for public use.The STN provides a valuable opportunity for enterprises to test the limits of their applications on the BSV blockchain, and prove for themselves that BSV\u2019s unlimited scaling can improve their performance. Massive blockchain scaling, only available on this network, provides the opportunity for businesses to switch to a faster, more secure network for their business applications.The Bitcoin Association\u2019s Bitcoin SV Node project is responsible for the STN initiative. It was developed by nChain, and had funding provided for it by CoinGeek. The Professional Stress Test team, nicknamed the Satoshi Shotgun, provides transaction traffic for the initiative, and any business that signs up can use that traffic to stress test whatever applications they are thinking of introducing.Currently, the BSV network is capable of handling 128MB blocks, already proven capable of handling 83,000 transactions in a single block, and Dr. Craig Wright, chief scientist at nChain, has said the plan is for 3 billion transactions per second or more. Steve Shadders, Director of Engineering at nChain and Technical Director of the Bitcoin SV Node project, said in the release:\u201cIn the coming months, we plan to increase the maximum block size of the Scaling Test Network to a massive 10 GB (10,000 megabytes) so that it can handle tens of thousands of transactions per second. We are moving past the era of filling up blocks and stepping into the realm of boundless growth. Our goal is not to push the limits, but to prove there are no limits.\u201dFor operators who are looking to handle thousands of deposits and withdrawals per minute, in addition to hundreds of thousands of game transactions every day, this network is capable of handling all of it, providing a high level of accountability while offloading the onerous costs of data centers to the blockchain. Blockchain and Bitcoin aren\u2019t just buzzwords anymore, you know have a safe testing environment to see how you can use them to work to your advantage.Jimmy Nguyen, Founding President of Bitcoin Association, said of the news:\u201cBig enterprises need a blockchain that can scale to handle their big transaction volume needs. The original Bitcoin, now back in the form of Bitcoin SV, always had that power, and we are now unlocking its massive scaling capability. We encourage businesses around the world to build applications on BSV, and are happy to provide the Scaling Test Network as a resource and safe environment for growing the BSV ecosystem.\u201dIf you\u2019re interested in testing out the network, visit https://bitcoinscaling.io/ or email stn@bitcoinsv.io to find out more and give it a try.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

Motherboard, an outlet of Vice, reports victims of the breach are discovering their cryptocurrency exchange wallets have been emptied.The original data breach allowed hackers to gain access to Outlook, Hotmail and MSN accounts. One user, John Ritmeester, talked about how the hackers used that opportunity: \u201cThe hackers also had access to my inbox allowing them to password reset my Kraken.com account and withdrawal [sic] my Bitcoin.\u201dThe way this worked was simple enough. The hackers used their access to set up a forwarding rule, sending any email with \u201cKraken\u201d mentioned in the email to their own Gmail address. They then would use the \u201cforgot my password\u201d feature on Kraken to send themselves a link to change the password to something new, gaining access to the Kraken account.Ritmeester discovered the whole thing when checking his email account\u2019s deleted items, finding both a password reset email and a withdrawal request. He lost 1 Bitcoin Core (BTC).Several other users have reported similar stories. Ritmeester noted that in his case, he did not have two-factor authentication turned on in his Kraken settings, which could have prevented the whole thing.In response to the new revelations, Microsoft wrote:\u201cCustomers who believe they have been impacted beyond what was outlined in the company\u2019s notification should contact the Microsoft support team for assistance.\u201dVictims of the hack feel like Microsoft is deliberately holding back full details of the hack to protect themselves from liability. Ritmeester told the outlet that he plans to file a police report, and is considering holding Microsoft liable for his lost funds.Questions should also be raised if Kraken shouldn\u2019t have a stronger security system around password resets. Considering money is at play, simply having a link sent to an email address, that might already be compromised, simply isn\u2019t enough when some customers have thousands of dollars saved in their exchange wallet. Some verification questions at a minimum would have helped save a few accounts from having losses.The lack of security on both of Microsoft and Kraken\u2019s part is alarming. Both companies need to prove they can do better, and be more professional about their customers\u2019 security.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

The New York-based firm also hailed the many benefits that accrue from blockchain implementation, especially for financial firms.The report, titled \u2018Blockchain Improves Operational Efficiency for Securitizations, Amid New Risks,\u2019 examined the differences between private and public blockchains, with each having its own set of benefits and risks.Public blockchains are easier to audit as well as collect and recover data. However, their decentralized nature makes them more susceptible to attacks. The firm thus advised firms that are exploring blockchain technology to consider private blockchains. However, they must be aware of the risks that come with it. These include a weaker consensus mechanism compared to public blockchains. The report added:\u201cPrivate/centralized blockchains are more exposed to fraud risk because system design and administration remains concentrated with one or few parties.\u201dDespite the risks posed by blockchain technology, its benefits are immense. The report looked at a number of industries which would benefit greatly by integrating blockchain technology, including the securities industry. The use of smart contracts could greatly streamline the creation and management of securities, the report deduced.We are still a long way from full-on blockchain integration, however. Currently, \u201capplications, in the near-term, will remain experimental, limited to pilot phases with a small number of participants and/or parallel processing with conventional technologies,\u201d the report concluded.In the future, smart contracts could revolutionize the legal industry, being applied in the development of legally binding agreements. In effect, this could replace law with code, at least partly. However, scripting language used to develop smart contracts means that they are less flexible than the current systems, the report explained:\u201cA full replacement of natural language contracts by computer code is unlikely, because of a lack of flexibility with regards to the scripting language. Furthermore, parties to a smart contract should consider governance and control mechanisms to ensure that modifications to the original contract can be made at a later stage without greater difficulties.\u201dDespite the hurdles that come with the new technology, institutions have greatly invested in its research and development.

In a Canadian province that already has attractive electricity rates, they will guarantee a reserved portion of their power grid for a few lucky companies.In an April 29 announcement, the R\u00e9gie de L\u2019\u00c9nergie (Energy Board) of Quebec have created a new client category for crypto miners, and guaranteed Hydro-Quebec (the local power company) would set aside 300 additional megawatts, on top of the 368MW already committed, for their use.To be eligible for this sweet deal, companies have to apply for the new client category and prove they are worthy. To get admitted, the R\u00e9gie will analyze the number of jobs the company creates, how much the plan to invest in the province, and how they will handle heat recovery from equipment that runs hot.They also rejected Hydro Quebec\u2019s preference that crypto miners bid on power supply. Instead, miners will continue paying a tariff, very much like manufacturers in the province have to pay.Quebec initially had an anti-mining stance, banning the activity for fear that it would drive up energy costs in the province. In May 2018, it reversed that stance, possibly to capitalize on its status as a low-cost destination, while other countries also added their own bans.Since July 2018, Hydro Quebec has charged CAD 0.15 ($0.11) per kilowatt-hour for cryptocurrency miners, which is double the rate that residential customers pay.As a result of those relatively low costs, Quebec has become a prime destination for crypto mining. Even in mid-2018, the province said that a quarter of all its energy was going towards the activity. Bitfarms has since made a major investment there, buying out Volta Electrique and installing 6,500 ASICs.Quebec\u2019s new policy of offering stability to mining firms, so long as their agenda lines up with that of the economic and environmental well-being of the province, looks like a win-win situation. Quebec gets a bunch of investment and well-paid jobs, and the miners get stable electricity costs, which can be difficult to come by otherwise.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

The phone, a second-generation blockchain device, is set to be commercially available by the second half of 2019, which the firm hopes will expand its presence within the global blockchain sector.Chen said that while blockchain technology was still developing, it was already changing the world, with the promise of \u201ctremendous commercial potential\u201d in the future.The HTC executive was quoted by the Central News Agency saying that the value of blockchain as analogous to the commercial value of petroleum from the early 20th century, in terms of the impact he expects blockchain to make on a global economic scale.He added that the core benefit of a blockchain phone was allowing access to data with absolute privacy, which Chen said underlined the value of the technology within the telecommunications sector.The launch follows HTC\u2019s original blockchain phone, the HTC Exodus, which was launched at the end of 2018. Since then, the firm reports sales have kept pace with expectations, prompting the decision to continue to invest in new blockchain products.In his speech, Chen also indicated the firm was looking beyond the blockchain phone to other technologies and innovation, including a broader portfolio of digital assets and investment in cryptocurrency applications.The move follows another recent announcement from HTC that the firm had set aside $50 million in a fund dedicated to developing their blockchain phone products.HTC is far from alone amongst smartphone manufacturers in exploring innovations around cryptocurrency. Samsung is now bundling some new phones with a crypto-based payments app, with some reports suggesting the firm may look to launch its own crypto token in the near future.With demand for the latest device fueled by the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies worldwide, the move looks set to position HTC as a leading manufacturer of blockchain-powered phones.\u2003Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

As with a number of Bitcoin\u2019s characteristics, the true story behind double hashes has been chopped up and put into a blender until a result was achieved that had nothing to do with the original design. Wright continues to publish bits and pieces to provide the real story and help to finally set the record straight on what Bitcoin is and what it isn\u2019t.Wright explains, \u201cWe can say that if we iterate a hash n times, it makes it n times as likely that a collision will occur. I am taking some liberty here, and the [math] involved in what I\u2019ve explained is not completely accurate, but it is true that for each time we rehash a function using the same hash function, we lose collision security for the function. In fact, if we look at how addresses in Bitcoin are created, we see that the double-hashing function increases the effect even further. In other words, the hash of the hash in the scenario is more likely to lead to a collision than a single hash or even the hash of the same hash function (a double hash).\u201dHe goes onto explain that the Wiki on Bitcoin Core (BTC) is completely wrong in its description of double-hashing. It isn\u2019t used to increase security, as indicated, although, in addressing, if one hash function is determined to be vulnerable, the other hash function will stay secure longer.One reason for the inclusion of the double-hash function in Bitcoin is to keep individual verification functions intact as Bitcoin Scales. Asserts Wright, \u201c[A] value [can be] sent to a miner in a way that doesn\u2019t allow them to broadcast a block without individual transactions. In a Merkle tree structure, we could have all of the block sent and solved apart from a single transaction. Doing so would allow us to construct an ASIC mining facility that does not host the data in blocks. The miner is now a distributed function.\u201dThe function also allows for the creation of a system that is able to be distributed and validated in accordance with laws. They can act in conjunction with local jurisdictions and \u201callows us to have immutable data storage that can be filtered with the hash being validated and a subsequent prune of illicit material being allowed in certain jurisdictions.\u201dNote: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

Through this platform, customers will be able to use the Ethereum and Hyperledger open source frameworks.Rahul Pathak, the General Manager, Amazon Managed Blockchain at AWS said:\u201cCustomers want to use blockchain frameworks like Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric to create blockchain networks so they can conduct business quickly, with a permanent record of transactions, but without the need for a centralized authority. However, they find these frameworks difficult to install, configure, and manage.\u201dThe blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) will reportedly allow businesses to develop their networks more quickly and at a lower cost. It eliminates the need for provision hardware, creates and manages certificates for access control, installs software, and configures network settings. Pathak added:\u201cAmazon Managed Blockchain takes care of provisioning nodes, setting up the network, managing certificates, and security, and scaling the network. Customers can now get a functioning blockchain network set up quickly and easily, so they can focus on application development instead of keeping a blockchain network up and running.\u201dIn addition, AMB provides simple APIs that allow customers to vote on memberships in their networks and to scale up or down more quickly.Amazon states that AMB can scale to support thousands to millions of transactions. So far, companies like AT&T Business, Nestl\u00e9 and the Singaporean investment market, the Singapore Exchange, have signed on to use Amazons Platform.AMB is available immediately in North Virginia and will soon expand to other regions hopefully next year. Additionally, QLDB will be generally available in the coming months.Last year in November when announcing the platform, Andy Jassy,\u00a0the Amazon CEO said that Amazon had spent a lot of time understanding why customers want blockchain rather than a database.Amazon combined the managed service with a centralized blockchain service, Amazon Quantum Ledger Database QLDB, that is reportedly a fully managed ledger database with a central trusted authority.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

Five of the biggest Canadian banks now allow users to digitally verify their identity through blockchain.The five banks are as follows: Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Scotiabank, Toronto-Dominion (TD) Bank and Desjardins Group. All five banks have partnered with an app called Verified.me, which is backed by Toronto blockchain startup SecureKey to offer safe and secure identity verification. According to a press release, additional financial institutions \u2013 such as National Bank of Canada, and Bank of Montreal (BMO), have signed on as well.The founder and CEO of Securekey, Greg Wolfond, spoke about the ever-increasing issues with cybersecurity when announcing the developments. Wolfond said:\u201cVerfied.me simplifies the sharing of personal information to help with identity verification in a safe way\u201d and described protecting our digital identity as \u201c\u2018one of the most enduring challenges of our time.\u201dVerified.me aims to empower individuals with control over their digital identity, by not only protecting personal information, but also allow individuals to control who to share their information with, and when. It is built on top of IBM blockchain technology. Customers download the mobile app, and it allows encrypted information to be shared without any actual information actually being stored within the Verified.me app. The idea is to allow users to safely and securely verify their identity from their smartphone to access various services.The app works because of a network built between various companies and organizations, including telecommunications agencies, financial institutions, and credit agencies. Wolfond wants his company to help allow individuals to access sensitive information in a verifiable and convenient manner.

The exchange promises to be privacy-oriented, which means, for all intents and purposes, that it\u2019s bound to test the anti-money laundering (AML) governance around the world.The exchange is called Local Bitcoin Cash, and it\u2019s the project of Roger Ver\u2019s Bitcoin.com. The P2P trading platform, once launched, will allow users to directly exchange their BCHABC holdings in a private manner. It boasts of three \u201ckey\u201d features: privacy, end-to-end side encryption, and security \u201cas the service never touches your funds.\u201dThe goal, according to Bitcoin.com, is to have \u201ca great resource\u201d for the BCHABC community and also \u201cto promote economic freedom to everyone across the globe by introducing them to the great benefits\u201d of the crypto coin. But do those so-called \u201cgreat benefits\u201d also apply to criminals trying to avoid AML laws?Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin is never intended to allow for anonymous transactions. Yes, it\u2019s\u00a0designed to incorporate privacy\u00a0in order to give users better control over their crypto activities. And while this feature is attractive to drug dealers, terrorists and hobbyists, it would drive enterprise businesses to more regulation-compliant options.It\u2019s also worth noting that cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets are now being required by many regulators around the world to report suspicious activities as well as identify anonymous users. Failure to comply with Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements could result in serious consequences\u2014from license suspension to severe penalty, and even jail time, such as in the case of Charlie Shrem who\u00a0went to prison in 2015\u00a0over his failure to report suspicious activities on his BitInstant crypto exchange.And yes, these AML directives also apply to anonymous exchanges. For example, Helsinki-based P2P crypto exchange LocalBitcoins announced in February that it\u2019s planning to introduce requirements for identity verification of its users. The move is\u00a0part of its effort to implement\u00a0the European Union\u2019s (EU) AML regulations, also known as the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD).The 5AMLD came into effect in July 2018, although EU member states have until January 2020 to update their regulatory framework so that it complies with the new requirements. By that time, anonymous crypto transactions will be\u00a0considered criminal in nature.This brings us to our earlier question: With its privacy-focused P2P exchange in the works, is BCHABC\u2014which is no longer Bitcoin as envisioned by the original Satoshi white paper\u2014gunning to become the criminal branch of the Bitcoin chain?Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

In other words, none of the women was \u201cpre-teen\u201d and all of the women were well above the legal age of consent.Ayre\u2019s attorneys noted that no one at Coin Rivet had approached Ayre for comment before the article was published. Furthermore, Coin Rivet\u2019s social media channels amplified the article\u2019s circulation by promoting it as \u201ctoday\u2019s most clicked article\u201d and \u201cour most clicked article over the weekend and currently occupying top spot in our Trending Now section.\u201dFollowing receipt of the attorneys\u2019 letter, Coin Rivet has taken the offending articles offline, but Ayre\u2019s attorneys aren\u2019t stopping there. The site had also claimed that Ayre had been referred to the likes of Interpol, various police departments and child abuse charities.But other articles reveal that it was Coin Rivet writer Helen Bennicke and one of her colleagues who had themselves \u201ccontacted the authorities after seeing what Calvin Ayre had posted,\u201d claiming that \u201cenough people are concerned that something needs doing about Calvin\u201d and that \u201cto do nothing would feel immoral.\u201dThis article, titled \u2018The seedy world of Calvin Ayre needs tackling,\u2019 has also been removed from Coin Rivet but copies remain posted to sites like Yahoo News due to Coin Rivet\u2019s deal to repurpose its material to sites with larger audiences.\u00a0(Please note the Yahoo News article has now been removed but to read a copy of the Coin Rivet\u2019s attack, click here).Ayre\u2019s attorneys have given Coin Rivet until April 8 to respond to their demands for redress, including publishing an apology to Ayre that acknowledges the falsity of the allegations. Failure to do so will result in proceedings against the site for libel.Ayre\u2019s attorneys are also currently monitoring a number of other groups and individuals who amplified Coin Rivet\u2019s libel and made libelous statements of their own. Anyone who leaves these ill-advised public utterances online or continues to engage in libelous activity will soon find themselves called upon to justify their actions in court.We reached out to Coin Rivet to allow them the opportunity to explain the true source of their antagonism towards Ayre but have received no response to date. Their silence speaks volumes regarding their newfound unwillingness to support these allegations when doing so might come at a personal cost.There\u2019s a growing consensus that the current plethora of crypto options will eventually narrow down to a single universally accepted coin. This winner-takes-all contest is increasingly being waged like an episode of Game of Thrones, with some proponents relying on the strength of their product while others resort to duplicity and backstabbing worthy of Cersei Lannister.The unfounded allegations made by the likes of Coin Rivet against Ayre have been eagerly adopted by crypto backers opposed to the Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) protocol that Ayre publicly supports.Ayre has also taken flak over his support for Craig Wright, nChain\u2019s lead scientist and BSV\u2019s chief architect. Ayre has publicly supported Wright\u2019s claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin, based on Wright having privately demonstrated unequivocal evidence to support such a claim.Ayre has also publicly voiced the view that the attacks against him are intended to damage BSV\u2019s standing in the court of public opinion and thereby elevate BSV\u2019s rivals to a position they don\u2019t actually deserve on their technical merits.Anyone wishing to learn the truth about BSV should attend the next CoinGeek Conference; in Toronto on May 29-30. There they\u2019ll discover a troll-free environment in which they can learn more about BSV\u2019s capacity for massive on-chain scaling, a feature that leaves House BSV well-positioned to vanquish the pretenders to crypto\u2019s Iron Throne.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

Elon Musk won by a landslide.What followed next amounts to proof that neither Dogecoin, which admits to be silly, nor Musk, should be taken seriously by crypto space. Musk proclaimed that the crypto might be his favorite, setting off a wave of hype, speculation, and memes. The Tesla CEO wasn\u2019t too proud to participate in the memes himself, tweeting a picture of a dog and captioning it \u201cDogecoin rulz.\u201dHe then updated his Twitter bio to indicate he was the CEO of Dogecoin, and retweeted an article from The Onion from late 2017 which satirized the industry, mocking its \u201cimaginary internet money.\u201dOne outlet then tied Musk\u2019s brief stint as CEO to a 30% rise in the cryptos price, which is fun to say, but is much more likely just part of a bigger bump in crypto prices. What that outlet, and many others miss, from this whimsical story, is the serious consequences it has on the greater goal of cryptocurrency adoption.The big goal in the crypto space is to convert the world over to cryptocurrency. That could be for Bitcoin Core (BTC), Bitcoin SV (BSV), or one of the many other altcoins on the market. None of that is helped by courting a CEO who just plain doesn\u2019t care about the industry, and instead makes a mockery of it.Musk has a huge social following. Many of his fans like Tesla cars, are excited about space travel with SpaceX, or find his Boring company amusing. A large number of his followers are not well informed cryptocurrency enthusiasts. What does it mean to them when he becomes the declared CEO of a joke coin, and shares a satirical article mocking all cryptos?What the cryptocurrency space needs is a true champion, who will show the world that with a digital currency, the world can be made a better place. Musk might have faith that cryptos will do that, but this recent silliness goes to show that he\u2019s a terrible spokesperson for the cause. That seems to be the case when he takes any interest that isn\u2019t electric cars or space travel, as the Thai cave rescue ordeal showed.\u00a0After the price of Dogecoin increased this week, Musk changed his Twitter bio to \u201cFormer Dogecoin CEO,\u201d before recently removing the reference entirely. That\u2019s for the best. The cryptocurrency space would be best served if Musk sticks to the things\u00a0he does best.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

Calvin Ayre claims crypto casualties - CoinGeek", "url": "https://coingeek.com/disinformation-campaign-v-calvin-ayre-claims-crypto-casualties/", "birthday": "2019-04-08T16:48:09+00:00", "date": "2019-04-08 16:48:09", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 8, "content": "The libelous disinformation campaign targeting Calvin Ayre is claiming more casualties, except this time it\u2019s the attackers who are paying the price.Last week, lawyers for CoinGeek founder Calvin Ayre launched a legal action against cryptocurrency news site Coin Rivet, which had published several articles alleging that Ayre was guilty of improper sexual conduct with underage girls during a trip to Cuba.On April 4, Coin Rivet editorial director Darren Parkin informed Ayre\u2019s attorneys that the site had pulled the offending articles offline, along with Coin Rivet\u2019s social media references to the articles, \u201cas a gesture of goodwill.\u201dIt\u2019s worth noting that, while Coin Rivet may have pulled its offending articles offline, partner content reposts of these same articles on mainstream news sites such as Yahoo remained online until Ayre\u2019s own media sites pointed out this discrepancy.Parkin also claimed that an article written by Coin Rivet\u2019s Helen Bennicke \u2013 who bragged about personally alerting law enforcement agencies regarding the allegations made against Ayre because \u201cto do nothing would feel immoral\u201d \u2013 was \u201cwithdrawn from publication within 15 minutes of being published.\u201d Parkin further claimed that Bennicke had \u201cleft the employment of Coin Rivet just days\u201d after the offending post was published.The removal of Bennicke\u2019s \u201copinion\u201d article doesn\u2019t negate the fact that someone \u2013 and given Parkin\u2019s status as editorial director, that dubious honor would appear to be his own \u2013 approved the article\u2019s publication in the first place. The fact that the article made it online at all suggests at least some tacit approval of the article\u2019s subject matter.Parkin\u2019s letter claimed that Coin Rivet now considers the matter closed, but the site has yet to address Ayre\u2019s pursuit of a public apology for spreading these false allegations, although such public contrition won\u2019t undo the damage caused by what Parkin referred to as this \u201cunfortunate episode.\u201dParkin and Coin Rivet CEO Sheba Karamat \u2013 as well as other individuals at crypto blogs that published similar articles \u2013 are about to discover that this \u2018episode\u2019 is anything but over, as Ayre\u2019s attorneys have responded with a new letter seeking more info on \u201cwhether others at Coin Rivet were driven by a dishonest agenda\u201d in deciding to publish these articles.Ayre is rightly outraged by the fact that these articles not only cast aspersions on his good name, they also sullied the reputations of the female members of the dance troupe in the social media images that sparked this unjustified uproar.Ayre has been publicizing similar \u2018lifestyle\u2019 promotional material for nearly two decades now, and the internet is awash in hundreds if not thousands of images and videos of Ayre with girls in bikinis. The fact that these recent images generated such controversy is both curious and revealing.Ayre is one of the major public proponents of the Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) protocol and its unique capacity for massive on-chain scaling. Ayre maintains that BSV offers the only real hope for a cryptocurrency becoming a truly global financial platform and not just another buy-and-forget form of \u2018digital gold.\u2019Ayre\u2019s support for BSV has made him an easy target for supporters of rival cryptocurrencies, who clearly hope that any mud that sticks to Ayre will simultaneously tarnish BSV\u2019s public image.Ayre\u2019s latest CoinGeek Conference is scheduled to kick off in Toronto on May 29-30. Crypto trolls are welcome to attend, but we suspect they won\u2019t, as spreading disinformation is a lot easier to do from the safety of one\u2019s basement. For more open-minded and less conflicted individuals, the future of money awaits in Toronto.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

While cramming in all of the reasons into a short article would not be possible, Bitcoin creator Dr. Craig Wright takes a stab at explaining some of the reasoning in a recent Medium post, discussing how laws are a solid foundation that can make the distinction between evidence and hearsay.In supporting his explanation, Wright refers to documents that carry his signature, as well as those of other individuals. These are samples of documents that some have tried to use against him, claiming them to be forgeries or falsifications, despite no evidence to support those claims.Wright explains, \u201cYou are responsible for what you say and print. When you make a false allegation claiming that someone has engaged in fraud and that you have proof of it because of a claim made over Twitter or some other source, you better check the probity of the source before you decide to repeat it.\u201dHe rightfully adds, \u201cWhen you take something that has not even been admitted as evidence, let alone proven to be true, and you decide to use it in defaming someone, you better have deep pockets, because in time, you who defame and slander and libel will face action.\u201dWright is about to start court proceedings related to charges against him. It\u2019s going to consume a significant amount of his time, but he knows he has law on his side and has the documentation to back it up. Those who have chosen to try and drag him through the mud will learn the hard way how their lack of ability to concentrate on the facts, and only chat based on supposition and hearsay, are now going to have ramifications.Wright adds, \u201cThere is a reason people in groups like Wikileaks seek to attack me, promote lies about me, and defame me. Such groups seek a world where they have power. (\u2026) They seek a world where records are altered, changed, and copied and where they can set the truth, come back, and change it at will. (\u2026) Anonymous and the other groups that support Wikileaks have hated me and everything I stand for a long time. They have hated me not for what they claim, but for a system that provides immutable truth that cannot be altered, a system that provides a single record that stops corruption, a system that makes fraud expensive and stops all they are supported by. With Bitcoin and Metanet, there is no reason for WikiLeaks and no way for such anonymous cowards to hide.\u201dNote: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

Crucially, he said Bitcoin Core (BTC) developers were trying to remove the key benefits of Bitcoin in pursuit of anonymity, effectively pushing its development in the wrong direction.In a post published on Medium, Dr. Wright said the Bitcoin ecosystem was being too prescriptive in shaping the future direction of the network. He wrote, \u201cHere lies the problem in the \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019 development community; they seek complexity, and end with chaos. Like many technocrats, they want to control the outcome and not let it evolve.\u201dHe argues that protocol must fixed, rather than flexible, and that any divergence was creating a competing protocol which is not Bitcoin as originally defined.\u201cMiners don\u2019t set protocol, rather the protocol is set in stone. If you change the protocol, you move away from Bitcoin. Protocol changes are not forks but rather new competing protocols with a possible airdrop,\u201d according to the nChain chief scientist. Wright has proven beyond a doubt to ownership of CoinGeek that he was the main architect of Bitcoin, and that it was he who conceived and used the pseudonymous name of Satoshi Nakamoto.He added, \u201cIf just over 50% of the miners want to increase the size of the cap, it will rise, and many miners who are rejecting the increase will go broke. It\u2019s how the system works. Hobby miners are forced to compete, and if they cannot, they are forced out of the network. Bitcoin was never a system designed to allow everyone to run a node. It was always destined for data centres.\u201dCriticising crypto developers for coveting anonymity over other features, Dr. Wright said this was completely at odds with the aims of Bitcoin.\u201cAs with all of such changes, the developers behind them are seeking to create an anonymous system. They are seeking to alter the protocol within Bitcoin and create something completely different. Bitcoin was never designed to be anonymous, and yet anonymity is what they are seeking,\u201d he noted.\u00a0He suggests those promoting anonymity are doing so with a view to using BTC for illegal transactions, such as buying drugs\u2014a strategy destined for failure long term. According to Dr. Wright:\u201c\u2026it is a false promotion of something that does not exist as an issue so that they can create a system that cannot be tracked easily by government and, more importantly, can lead to something they believe will act as an anonymous currency allowing drug sales. The flaw in their argument stems, as always, from the fact that in a legal system, such a desired currency is easy to stop. To have value, bitcoin needs to be easily exchanged. To be able to do so, it needs to be legal.\u201dNow that Bitcoin has been reborn as\u00a0Bitcoin SV,\u00a0it has once again taken its path as the blockchain that can revolutionize global industry through a stable protocol and massive blockchain scaling. If that\u2019s exciting to you, come to the\u00a0CoinGeek Toronto conference.

Wright.On April 11, attorneys for Wright, the individual behind the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym, launched a legal action against the individual behind the @Hodlonaut Twitter account. Wright\u2019s attorneys accuse @Hodlonaut of orchestrating a \u201ctargeted campaign\u201d to harass and libel Wright with \u201chighly defamatory and abusive tweets.\u201dLater that same day, the Hodlonaut account went dark, apparently spooked by CoinGeek\u2019s coverage of the legal tiff, which included two photos believed to be the individual behind Hodlonaut. The photos, both posted via @Hodlonaut, appear to show the individual behind the account and the distinctive tattoos on each of his arms.Hodlonaut\u2019s online supporters took exception to Wright\u2019s offer of US$5,000 in Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) as a reward for information that can help identify the individual behind the Twitter account. As a result, some of them have temporarily changed their Twitter avatars to match Hodlonaut\u2019s cat-in-spacesuit image, adding a hashtag variation on the \u201cI\u2019m Spartacus\u201d meme.Unfortunately, that analogy would only apply if Spartacus was famous for doing some really dumb things, like publicly accusing BSV supporter Calvin Ayre of being a pedophile without a shred of evidence to support that slur.Hodlonaut deleted those tweets \u2013 and others accusing Wright of being a \u201cvery sad and pathetic scammer\u201d and \u201cmentally ill\u201d \u2013 after attorneys reminded him that libel is still a crime. You know, just like Spartacus agreed to give up his quest and return to his life of slavery after learning that the Romans also had swords.And Spartacus tried to give himself up to the Romans in order to spare his men, which is the polar opposite of the road taken by Hodlonaut, who simply vanished rather than have to legally justify some of his more dubious public positions. Viewed in that light, it might be more apt for Hodlonaut\u2019s supporters to proclaim \u201cI\u2019m Osama,\u201d although that probably wouldn\u2019t offer them the specific rebel cachet they seek.Neither Wright nor Ayre seek to crucify Hodlonaut outside the gates of Rome, but they do want to set the record straight regarding Wright\u2019s rightful place in history at the birth of Bitcoin. They also want to ensure that other social media motormouths learn there is a price to pay for taking legally sketchy stances in public.This whole episode is further evidence of the perpetual immaturity that plagues this industry, an arrested development that needs to end if this industry is to be taken seriously. BSV is dedicated to enterprise use for this very reason.Hodlonaut is/was a public booster of the Lightning Network, the off-chain appendage intended to add slightly more transaction capacity to the irredeemably constricted Segwit Coin. So he has a clear self-interest in targeting Ayre and Wright in the hope of diminishing the public profile of BSV and preventing people from learning of its capacity for massive on-chain scaling.If you want to learn the truth about BSV and its role in the future of money in a troll-free environment, we encourage you to check out the latest CoinGeek Conference going down in Toronto on May 29-30.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

Wright is ratcheting up his legal fight against a defamatory campaign led by conflicted crypto critics.On March 29, Dr. Wright, the individual behind the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym and part of the team that created Bitcoin, filed legal papers targeting the individual behind the @Hodlonaut Twitter account. Hodlonaut was accused of waging a \u201ctargeted campaign\u201d to harass and libel Wright with \u201chighly defamatory and abusive tweets.\u201dOn April 12, Wright\u2019s attorneys issued similar legal papers to two individuals \u2013 Bitcoin podcast host Peter McCormack and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin \u2013 and to cryptocurrency blog Chepicap, all of which he accuses of making similarly defamatory claims that Wright is a fraud for claiming to be Satoshi.Conveniently enough, mere hours before his papers arrived, McCormack publicly (via Twitter) \u2018demanded\u2019 to be the target of such a lawsuit. McCormack subsequently told his Twitter followers that the letter from Wright\u2019s attorneys was \u201cnonsense,\u201d repeated his \u2018Faketoshi\u2019 slur against Wright and invited Wright\u2019s attorneys to \u201cplease proceed with court proceedings.\u201d As for that latter quote, word has it that McCormack\u2019s request will be granted on Monday.Buterin has so far said little publicly about receiving his letter, while Chepicap has posted a few dismissive articles that primarily referenced the other recipients. All of those who received letters on Friday have been given until April 23 to make formal responses, after which Wright will decide whether to proceed with libel and harassment suits.Wright\u2019s aim in targeting individuals and sites alleging fraud is to counter the ongoing dissemination of \u2018proofs\u2019 that purport to show the falsity of his claim to the Satoshi mantle. These incorrect or invalid proofs, often cherry picked from documents that may or may not have originated from Wright, along with other hearsay and fabrications, appear to be part of a deliberate effort to discredit Wright and thus diminish his influence on the Bitcoin sector.It\u2019s time for the Bitcoin community to finally emerge from its extended adolescence and start behaving as a serious force in the world of global finance. This isn\u2019t going to happen if the community continues to resemble a hyperbolic Reddit thread in which death threats are exchanged over whether Han or Greedo shot first.In a more adult world, the sector\u2019s focus would be on the technology, particularly the Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) protocol, the only one capable of the massive on-chain scaling necessary to meet the demands of a global financial platform. But until that magical day when tech trumps name-calling, here we are.Where you should be if you want to have an open and honest discussion about the future of money and blockchain technology is the next CoinGeek Conference in Toronto on May 29-30. The CoinGeek event is inclusive and welcomes everyone interested in learning about Bitcoin SV and the Satoshi Vision, even if you also support other cryptocurrency or blockchain projects. Whether or not any of Wright\u2019s adversaries make an appearance remains to be seen, but if they do show, they need to bring better arguments to support their respective alt-coins than they have to date.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

{"title": "Dr. Craig Wright calls out Adam Back, ready to prove he\u2019s Satoshi - CoinGeek", "url": "https://coingeek.com/craig-wright-defamation-suit-adam-back-blockstream/", "birthday": "2019-04-16T16:06:24+00:00", "date": "2019-04-16 16:06:24", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 16, "content": "On April 16, Dr. Craig Wright, the man behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto and a member of the team that created Bitcoin, continued his legal fight to defend himself against harassment by filing legal papers against Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, for defamation and libel.Back (pictured above left), who invented Hashcash in the 1990s and co-founded Blockstream, has said in the past that it\u2019s clear \u201cfrom a tech perspective\u201d that Wright (pictured right) was not Satoshi. He then tweeted on April 10 that Wright had published \u201cfake proofs\u201d and forgeries while also alluding to the idea that Wright had committed tax fraud.It\u2019s worth remembering that Back has long opposed Wright\u2019s efforts to expand the size of individual blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain. Back preferred limiting the number of possible transactions per block and forcibly herding users onto Blockstream\u2019s Lightning Network side-chain, a model that primarily benefited Blockstream, not end users.That\u2019s why Wright\u2019s attempt to prove he is Satoshi Nakamoto is so threatening, and why Back would attempt to deny it. With Satoshi himself providing guidance on what Bitcoin could be, Blockstream\u2019s plan appears all the more misguided.Wright\u2019s legal team\u2019s request is simple and exactly what he\u2019s requested of his other harassers. Back merely has to retract his statements, not make them again, apologize and acknowledge the statements were false. If Back doesn\u2019t comply, Wright will be happy to take him to court.That might be that the only way to settle all of this, and end the harassment of Wright. That\u2019s why Wright has turned to legal recourses not only against Back, but also against Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who has also alleged that Wright is not Satoshi. Wright is ready to stand up in court and prove that he\u2019s Satoshi, and he dares his detractors to be adults about the whole thing and face him in a court of law. It might prove to be an ugly affair, but it\u2019s the fairest way to end this mess once and for all.The question is if Wright\u2019s detractors will be willing to do just that. They have so much to gain by not allowing Wright to irrefutably prove his Satoshi identity that they may want to find a way out. As damaging as a market downturn would be, Satoshi revealing himself, and proving that his original vision, now reborn as Bitcoin SV (BSV), was the right course all along, would prove far more damaging to them in the long run.Wright will prove he\u2019s Satoshi, either by telling his story in his own time, or stepping up in court. Regardless, BSV, through its massive on-chain scaling, will prove to be a superior protocol than either Blockstream\u2019s Bitcoin Core (BTC) with its Lightning side-chain or Ethereum. BSV has already demonstrated that Satoshi\u2019s original vision of massive scaling is not only possible, but is a successful strategy for electronic cash and immutable data ledgers.If that original Satoshi Vision sounds right to you, even if you currently support other cryptocurrency or blockchain projects, then attend the inclusive CoinGeek Toronto conference, happening May 29-30. You can register to hear about the massive scaling plans that the BSV development team has coming, and the opportunities they will bring.

Yes, most by now understand that it is the original Bitcoin following the original design, protocol and vision of Satoshi Nakamoto based on the white paper and other sources. Most everyone smart also by now agrees that Craig Wright is the inventor of Bitcoin.However, the distraction caused by the endless trolling and cyberbullying of Craig and his legal efforts to stop them are not what is important. What is important is to understand the different between Bitcoin SV and all other copycat platforms and why they are all so scared of Bitcoin SV.Binance and a cartel of these altcoin-dependent exchanges just launched a delist attack on Bitcoin SV under the guise of it being about Dr. Craig Wright. I am sure the young and inexperienced leaders of Binance and the cartel think this is smart. It is not.They are right that Bitcoin SV is an existential threat for them all. Bitcoin SV is designed to be the \u201cpower everything\u201d platform, and can scale to do everything that all other blockchain and DLT project claim to do and far, far more. It can power Internet of Things Dr. Craig Wright\u2019s greater vision of the Metanet, where Bitcoin SV subsumes and powers the entire Internet and monetizing all data.This means that if Dr. Wright\u2019s vision comes to pass, the world will operate on a single global blockchain, just like we operate on a single public internet. There will be no other public blockchains or cryptocurrencies, and the only tokens other than BSV itself will be financial and other real world assets tokenized on top of BSV.The Bitcoin SV vision also means that the future of crypto exchanges will change. Currently, exchanges list far too many tokens in order to inflate fee revenue from trading as many cryptocurrencies as possible and generating casino-like fervor. This model will come to an end. The future is the model of FloatSV, a newly-launched and BSV-focused exchange. As stated on its website, FloatSV \u201conly supports tokenized real assets\u201d and does so \u201cby committing to list only blockchains running Proof of Work SHA256 and real assets such as commodities and currencies.\u201d The casino style speculative exchanges without banking will ultimately cease to exist.This is the real reason Binance and some other exchanges are afraid of Bitcoin SV, and why they illegally banded together to try to incite a mob mentality on social media to harm Bitcoin SV. Craig\u2019s legal actions to defend himself from trolling was just the excuse they choose to justify this. That and his prior social media conduct when Craig is not even on Twitter anymore.But this is the amazing part. None of these youngsters in this cartel understand that Bitcoin SV does not need the casino-style exchange to succeed. We are building a blockchain that has real utility for businesses and consumers, to enable massive amounts of real payment and data transactions, to support the BSV token with real long-term value. Therefore, its \u201cuse case\u201d is not trading against other cryptocurrencies to make money, like the speculative investment scheme for most other tokens. It is a utility platform for the BSV token to actually be used on BSV blockchain, so it only needs fiat on and off ramps. At some point, the BSV ecosystem will also need regulated secondary markets for security and commodity tokens of real world assets, such as FloatSV is anticipating. But at no point in its life does Bitcoin SV\u2019s ecosystem need casino-style speculative exchanges for trading against large numbers of coins that are not real assets. Bitcoin SV is a utility backbone to run everything and this makes it unique as no other blockchain platform has this plan or ability.This means that in launching this attack, all these exchange guys have done is sped up the inevitable march of regulation over their actions. This was coming anyway as on June 19th, 2018, the fifth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD 5) was published in the official journal of the European Union. Among other things, the EU Directive extends all the traditional anti-money laundering laws to virtual currency platforms and wallet providers. I can\u2019t wait for this Directive to be implemented in all EU countries. I\u2019m sure the crypto exchange landscape will quickly change.Meanwhile, all Bitcoin SV needs is to finish restoring the original Bitcoin protocol, keep it stable and keep massively scaling. If it does that, big enterprises will come build on BSV what they cannot do on other platforms, and BSV will consume \u2013 by its superior technology \u2013 the entire crypto ecosystem of the world. This is Dr. Craig Wright\u2019s vision and that is why it really does not matter who invented Bitcoin, because he sure as hell invented Bitcoin SV and in doing this he has changed the world for the better.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

Many reports have indicated that the number one reason cryptos are becoming popular in Africa is as an alternative financial service. This is partly true. Cryptos are helping millions of Africans find a cheaper and faster alternative to legacy money transfer services. However, surprisingly, Africans are using cryptos more for trading and speculative reasons than for transacting.As has been well documented, Africa is the most under-banked region in the world. According to the World Bank, 66% of Africans remain unbanked, the highest such proportion in the world. Due to this, the crypto gospel has found a fertile ground in the continent. Services such as Bitpesa, Centbee and Wala have been standout successes, utilizing cryptos to give their users seamless financial services platforms.However, a majority of Africans aren\u2019t looking at cryptos to make payments and for remittances. Instead, they are using it for speculative purposes. I recently had a talk with Eugene Madondo, an executive at Coindirect, a crypto exchange that operates in several African countries including South Africa and Kenya. According to him, a majority of Africans are using cryptos to trade and in some cases, diversify their investment portfolios. Whenever crypto prices increase ever so slightly, the activity on African crypto exchanges rises significantly. This indicates that a huge chunk of Africans who hold cryptos use them to trade.Madondo\u2019s observation is supported by the number and distribution of crypto payment options in the continent. In Kenya, the number of retailers that process crypto payments are just a handful. Those that have continued to accept crypto payments even during the crypto winter have also seen the numbers reduce by huge proportions in the past year. Betty\u2019s Place, a restaurant located 150 kilometers from the capital Nairobi, has been one of the standout cases. The proprietor, Beatrice Wambugu, has received global recognition for not only accepting cryptos, but for conducting seminars where she teaches about cryptos and blockchain technology.Kenya also presents a unique challenge for crypto payments. The country is the birthplace of M-Pesa, a mobile payments service that is used by over 75% of the adult population in the country. The service processes transactions in less than five seconds. Agents who facilitate the payments can be found in even the most remote locations. On the other hand, Bitcoin Core (BTC) transactions take upwards of 10 minutes on average. Sometimes, they can take up to 45 minutes. This makes paying in BTC unrealistic for most Kenyans. There are some blockchains that are much faster, such as Bitcoin SV, which processes transactions in a few seconds. Ripple\u2019s XRP and Dash are also fast; however, merchants accepting these cryptos aren\u2019t as popular as BTC merchants.Nigeria has done a bit better than Kenya. In the West African country, the number of stores that accept cryptos is a bit higher. In a conversation I recently had with Nathaniel Luz, an executive at Dash Nigeria, he revealed that more crypto enthusiasts are choosing to pay in cryptos. Dash Nigeria is an advocacy group that lobbies for the adoption of Dash cryptocurrency. However, Luz told me that the numbers are still quite low, with many crypto users deciding to hodl until their tokens hit peak prices again.It\u2019s still not a lost cause. Cryptos are making inroads in the continent that has traditionally lagged behind in terms of adoption. With the use of smartphones and internet penetration increasing with each passing day, cryptos will continue to become popular and in due time, they could become the predominant transactional method in Africa.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

It dropped by the Handlebar Grill in Makati, and Bitcoin fans came together to have a great time and share their appreciation for the reborn Bitcoin, Bitcoin SV (BSV).The event was hosted once again by John Goldberg, the mind behind the Bitcoin Jeepney and creator of the Pixel Wallet and Forever Fund. Food and drinks were available for rock bottom prices, and Goldberg provided free jeepney rides around the neighborhood for anyone who wanted to try the vehicle out.Goldberg said of the event:\u201cTonight\u2019s event was full of people having a good time, talking and using Bitcoin SV. We had many users get to experience Pixel Wallet which allows user to send Bitcoin SV encoded securely into an image. The platform works on popular sites like Facebook, Telegram, WeChat, Email and many others allowing users to connect globally.\u201dAll in all, 40 BSV enthusiasts showed up to the event, joining the 50 or so regulars at the bar. That\u2019s a pretty good turnout for an Easter Saturday in Manila, when typically, everyone tries to leave town and enjoy some time in smaller towns or at the beach.The organizers of the event convinced the bar to show an interview of Bitcoin Ambassador and CoinGeek Founder Calvin Ayre, talking to CoinGeek\u2019s own Becky Liggero.The enthusiasm of the BSV\u2019ers was overflowing, and got the attention of the regulars at the bar. Nearly all of the onlookers decided to sign up to either Handcash or Centbee.The event was made possible by many of the businesses that have already adopted the digital currency of the future. Goldberg said, \u201cWe would like to thank CoinGeek, Handcash, Centbee, MoneyButton, Fivebucks, SimplyCash and Streamanity. These platforms, services and wallets that we can use Bitcoin SV daily we thank everyone for coming out.\u201dThe next wish by the group was to see greater BSV adoption in the Philippines, namely by the country\u2019s biggest exchange platform, Coins.ph. \u201cWe hope to see companies like coins.ph to start accepting BSV in the Philippines,\u201d said Goldberg.If you missed out on the fun because you were a little too far away, maybe you can join the CoinGeek Toronto scaling conference, running May 29-30.

This is made impossible with logs immutably recorded on the blockchain, which can be used to trace the origins of hacks to a device, with no opportunity for cover-up or data manipulation.He also explained how private/public key pairs could be used in ECDSA personal device security, robustly protecting against unauthorized access through multiple authentication factors. This could be adapted to allow devices such as laptops and smartphones to automatically verify and authenticate users based on blockchain data.Dr. Wright explained that this could even be achieved without an exchange of data, eliminating the potential for \u2018man in the middle\u2019 style hacks and eavesdropping through encryption and decryption.Many of the features raised in the presentation can be implemented with standard functions, with OP_RETURN transactions an example of how this type of personal device security can be executed on the bitcoin blockchain.Brunel University becomes the latest high profile institution to host Dr. Wright, coinciding with another recent presentation at the University of Oxford.

This month, nChain Chief Scientist Dr. Craig Wright joined as a speaker, and he had a lot to say about Bitcoin, and his ongoing effort to prove his pseudonymous identity as Satoshi Nakamoto.He began his talk by discussing how much the development of Bitcoin has been set back by the Bitcoin Core (BTC) development team. Dr. Wright noted that, although he was not a public figure in 2013, he was working with a team to develop new things, but all of that was set back when BTC hijacked the protocol to take it in its own ways.\u201cWhat does money need?\u201d He asked the crowd. \u201cIt needs to be stable, right? \u2026 We want to build. It\u2019s that simple.\u201dThat\u2019s simply not possible with how the Core team has taken BTC. \u201cProblem with Core is that you need to check with them on what the roadmap will be because it\u2019s unstable,\u201d Dr. Wright explained. Developers can\u2019t build for the future because there is no way for them to know what the protocol will be a few months down the road. As a result, businesses can\u2019t grow, because no business can work on plans that need to change every few months.The plan for Bitcoin, now reborn as Bitcoin SV (BSV), is comparatively simple. \u201cWhat if we actually have something stable, and we have something that allows people to build,\u201d he explained. He also laid out a clear vision for how long this stability can last:\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is very simple. We\u2019re going to scale Bitcoin. And we\u2019re going to have the protocol so that a transaction that was written in 2009, and signed, will run in the year 2100, that hasn\u2019t been on the blockchain now, that can be sent then, and will still be accepted. Now you can say that\u2019s backwards.\u201dHe also talked extensively about how he\u2019s tried to maintain his privacy, and never really wanted to come out as Satoshi Nakamoto. It was demanded of him though, so now he\u2019s proving his identity his way. \u201cI, who didn\u2019t want to talk about my past, will do it the way I want to,\u201d Dr. Wright declared. \u201cIn court, the way people have real rules of evidence. Things that have been built up.\u201dHe very much understands that he might be his own worst enemy in convincing people of the truth, but he knows evidence is on his side. \u201cI\u2019m not a good marketer,\u201d Dr. Wright said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned to be better with people. I\u2019ve learned to be different. That\u2019s the world.\u201dUltimately, Wright is not focused on proving he\u2019s Satoshi to achieve any measure of power. He explains early in the video that he\u2019s content to be rich, he doesn\u2019t want to be famous. Instead, he is focused on fixing Bitcoin, and setting its protocol in stone, the way his white paper originally intended it to be.If you agree with that vision, and get excited when you think about the unlimited possibilities with Bitcoin SV, join the CoinGeek Toronto scaling conference.

And now, one cryptojacking malware is going a step further by shutting down the other cryptominers in a system. In doing so, it frees up more processing power for its own cryptojacking operation.Known as Shellbot, the malware targets Linux servers that are connected to the internet and that have a weak password. After locating its victim, it then uses the SSH brute force technique to break in. This is a technique in which hackers relentlessly try out thousands of common passwords until one of them pans out.According to a report by Boston-based cyber security firm Threat Stack, a new variant of Shellbot has added some new capabilities. Once the hackers install the malicious payload on a server, they can run commands remotely as well as check the status of the malware. Once installed, the malware begins mining Monero, a crypto that has proven popular with cryptojackers due to its ease of mining and supposed anonymity.The Shellbot malware, which was first discovered by cyber security firm Jask, sends the mined Monero tokens to a MoneroHash server. Threat Stack found that the malware was making $300 a day. As it infects more servers, this figure could skyrocket.The Threat Stack team also believes that the threat goes beyond cryptojacking. Shellbot\u2019s ability to evolve and add new features could allow it to target its victims in more ways than one.Threat Stack\u2019s chief security officer Sam Bisbee told TechCrunch:\u201cThe threat actors behind this campaign have shown the ability and willingness to update this malware with new functionality after it has gained a foothold on an infected system. They are fully capable of using this malware to exfiltrate, ransom or destroy data.\u201dThreat Stack found the malware on a Linux server belonging to one of its clients. It withheld the client\u2019s name, only revealing that it\u2019s a U.S company with international operations. The infected server was shut down after the security team realized that the hackers were using it to target other vulnerable machines.Just recently, a report revealed that over 150,000 Electrum wallets have been infected with malware. The hackers have already stolen over $4.6 million worth of Bitcoin Core (BTC).Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

The bill officially accords the same validity to blockchain records that all the other electronic records have in the state.The bill also provides legal definitions for the \u2018distributed ledger\u2019 and \u2018blockchain\u2019, further cementing the validity of the technology in the state. It defines blockchain as a \u201ccryptographically secured, chronological, and decentralized consensus ledger or consensus database maintained via internet, peer-to-peer network, or other similar interaction.\u201dThe bill, which was signed into law by Governor Jay Inslee, includes a clause that explicitly protects blockchain records from discrimination:\u201cAn electronic record may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because it is generated, communicated, received, or stored using distributed ledger technology.\u201dThe bill was introduced on January 25 by four Washington legislators. It sought to revise the longstanding \u201cWashington Electronic Authentication Act\u201d which guides the state\u2019s law in matters relating to electronic records. After going through the mandatory readings, it was voted into law by an overwhelming 96-1 majority.The new law is expected to go a long way in encouraging more companies in the state to implement distributed ledger technology in their operations. It assures these companies that any records they store on the blockchain are legally valid.Washington becomes the latest state that seeks to become the leader in the advancement of blockchain technology. Last month, lawmakers in the state of Utah tabled a bill that seeks to exempt blockchain companies from being classified as money transmitters. This would free them of the scrutiny that such businesses face, especially due to the Money Transmitter Act. The bill also sought to create a taskforce that would be solely responsible for drafting blockchain-related regulations.Utah joined other pioneering states such as Wyoming, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana, all of whom have kick-started processes that are meant to foster blockchain advancement.Wyoming in particular has taken the lead in blockchain regulation. The state passed five bills two months ago that seek to boost blockchain technology. The state even has a blockchain task force led by the former Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse executive Caitlin Long. Their efforts haven\u2019t gone unrewarded with startups like BeefChain, which recently acquired a USDA certification, springing up in the state.

Alex Shore, chief technical officer of BitBoss, told CoinGeek:\u201cWe built Keyring for our own needs while developing our online gaming ecosystem that runs on Bitcoin SV, however we plan to enhance this library in an effort to help the entire Bitcoin SV community of developers. All contributions of code, feedback, and feature requests are welcome. We will be using GitHub issues to track work and will monitor it closely.\u201dKeyring has been designed to work with BSV first and foremost, and it uses all of BSV\u2019s functionality, including support for larger OP_Return sizes. Their website states, \u201cWith KeyRing it is very easy to add new op returns and script templates because of how the library is designed to work with multiple chains.\u201dThis new addition to the BSV development community demonstrates once again the maturity and collaboration present in the Bitcoin industry. BitBoss are first and foremost game developers though, and their website has sneak peeks into several gaming innovations they are currently working on, including blockchain-based slots, lotteries and a sportsbook.This is a timely new resource for BSV, considering the Bitcoin Association recently announced the unveiling of the Bitcoin SV Scaling Test Network (STN). Developers and businesses now have easy to use code to help develop new applications with, and a professional test environment to fully stress test those applications for their business needs.

This has led to the finger of suspicion being pointed at Bitcoin SV proponents, specifically nChain Chief Scientist Dr. Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre, as well as the suggestion that the CoinGeek mining pool is somehow involved. Ayre, however, has confirmed that neither he nor Wright\u2014the real Satoshi Nakamoto\u2014is involved in this shenanigan.nobody working on real #Bitcoin #BSV even has time to think about the dogs breakfast Alphabet soup has forked to\u2026this is not me and I don't believe Craigs pool has that much hash.

Dr. Wright has proven beyond a doubt to ownership of CoinGeek that he was the main architect of Bitcoin, and that it was he who conceived and used the pseudonymous name of Satoshi Nakamoto.In late 2018, some group took it upon themselves to create a Craig S Wright coin\u2014clearly another attack on Dr. Wright by the Ethereum crowd. It\u2019s worth noting that Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, is already facing libel charges following his defamatory comments against Dr. Wright. Buterin has made several statements in the past, in which he called Wright a\u00a0fraud\u00a0and questioned why the industry allowed him to speak at conferences.It\u2019s evident that the attacks against Dr. Wright are primarily intended to trash the\u00a0Bitcoin Satoshi Vision\u00a0(BSV) protocol that the nChain chief scientist supports. Wright maintains that BSV is the real target due to its capacity for massive on-chain scaling, which represents an existential threat to the future of other cryptocurrencies.If you want to learn more about the future of cryptocurrency with no limits, join the\u00a0upcoming\u00a0CoinGeek Conference\u00a0in Toronto on May 29-30.

The company revealed in its report to investors that it had generated $65.5 million in BTC revenue in the first quarter of this year. The figure represents a 25 percent increase from the previous quarter where the company generated $52.4 million in revenue from BTC sales.However, the unaudited report revealed that the firm is still struggling with a small profit margin. From its $65.5 million in sales, it only generated $832,000 in profits. While the profit is still 70 percent higher than it was in the last quarter of 2018, it\u2019s yet to hit the figures many expect from the operation. The company also revealed that its total revenue grew 43 percent to stand at $959 million.The report by Square goes against the grim picture that many crypto skeptics have painted. According to them, interest in cryptos has fizzled out in the past year. However, it seems that it hasn\u2019t and interest is growing at a high rate. What\u2019s more, Square has recorded a rising interest in its BTC product for the past four quarters. In 2018, the company sold more than $166 million worth of BTC.Crypto researcher and analyst Ryan Todd took to Twitter to explain just how significant the announcement by Square was. According to him, accounting for the change in BTC prices, the volume on Square is up more than 70 percent.Square just reported a record $65.5m in quarterly bitcoin sales. Assuming average BTC prices in 1Q19 (not perfect) that translates to ~ 17K worth of BTC volume, up over 70% since 4Q and +5x volumes in 1Q18.

Recently, Jack announced that Square Crypto would hire engineers to develop a better crypto ecosystem. The engineers would report to him directly and would be paid in crypto.Despite all the efforts, not everyone has been impressed with Square\u2019s efforts. To some, Jack has managed to manipulate the crypto community into becoming die-hard Square fans. One of the people who share this opinion is Cobra Bitcoin, the anonymous owner of Bitcoin.org. He took to Twitter to criticize Jack and Square:Gotta respect how hard @sqcrypto is pandering to Bitcoiners. Very clever how @Jack has embedded himself in the community; in return the community promotes @CashApp, which gives that service a small but dedicated and activist group of early users.\u2014 C\u00f8bra (@CobraBitcoin) April 10, 2019Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

However, that positive movement of around 3% was not actually replicated in other currencies which continued showing signs of slow momentum. Ethereum (ETH) was up by around 2% to the $164 level, whilst Ripple (XRP) was practically flat at just over the $0.30 level. Bitcoin SV (BSV) was also up by around 2% to touch the $55 level on the back of increased interest and turnover.Other coins with larger market caps also demonstrated slight gains with BCHABC up by around 2% to the $275 level, whilst Litecoin (LTC) was up by around 3% to the $75 level. EOS rose by a similar percentage and seemed to be touching the $5 level quite soon where it was trading at around $4.90 at press time on Friday. NEO was up by around 2% to the $9.95 level and was poised to break the $10 mark at any time. Conversely, Stellar Lumens (XLM) was rather flat at just over the $0.10 mark on the back of a 0.7% increase. Cardano (ADA) was up by around 4% to the $0.071 level, whilst IOTA continued languishing after its massive rise at the beginning of the week on the back of its partnership announcement with Land Rover and was trading at around $0.286 at press time on Friday.Currencies with smaller market caps had mixed performances with most registering good increases although others fell behind. Amongst the best performers were ATOM and QTUM, which were up by 9 and 7% respectively, whilst BAT, MATIC and FET all dropped with their decreases ranging from 2% to 9% respectively.

It has had an extremely rough 12 months and has had to shutter many of its operations this year as its losses mount. It was also forced to back out of its planned initial public offering (IPO) over financial concerns, which hasn\u2019t left investors too happy, and the company still doesn\u2019t appear to be able to find its footing. Now, the architect behind its S7 and S9 mining rigs is out, which could signal another nail in the coffin for the company.According to Twitter user BTCKING555, who routinely provides the inside scoop on Bitmain\u2019s activities, tweeted, \u201cSources say Dr. Yang who led S7 and S9 and left to start Shenma has better chip on 8/10nm node. Letting Dr. Yang and his team go was probably as dumb as selling all of the [Bitcoin Core] and going all in for BCH [Bitcoin Cash].\u201dIf that is the case, Bitmain has lost one of its most important sources of talent. The move doesn\u2019t bode well for the future of the company.\u00a0BTCKING555 also made another telling revelation that could be a further example of the troubles Bitmain is experiencing. He said, \u201cBreaking: TSMC [Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company] did not give Bitmain capacity! All given to 5G customers. There is nothing until Q4. Bitmain has ruined reputation and TSMC puts it in \u201clow priority\u201d customer list. Antminer 17 will be in very limited capacity \u2013 OK yield wafers perhaps 1200 at most! That\u2019s peanuts.\u201dThe move isn\u2019t surprising, given that Bitmain at one point had an outstanding debt of $1 billion with the tech company. It took a year to make good on $700 million of the amount owed. TSMC has also reportedly run out of 7nm-capacity processors, which Bitmain needs for its rigs, because it sold them to companies that paid their bills\u2014Apple, Huawei, AMD, Qualcomm and others.Bitmain has been facing several lawsuits and is reportedly deep in debt. The company has allegedly been cherry-picking S15 miners, from a pool of 1,000, to try and show off its wares to investors in order to raise capital. That would mean that it doesn\u2019t feel comfortable trying to impress potential investors with any of its new stock.\u00a0Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, the company has begun to recruit financial firms and merchants to assist in the launch of its crypto payments system, which is reportedly being dubbed Project Libra.Facebook has been in touch with Visa and Mastercard, as well as First Data Corp, a payment processor, according to sources. It is also looking to receive around $1 billion in investment funds, which would be used to protect the company\u2019s new digital currency, the Facebook Coin, from volatility. The social media giant is also apparently in discussion with ecommerce merchants about accepting the coin and is willing to accept small investments from those merchants to help it reach its investment goal.How the system will play out isn\u2019t completely understood. Facebook has been relatively silent, offering only that it is exploring different options. There has been talk that users could earn crypto for their activity on the platform\u2014as well as for watching advertising\u2014and that the system would allow for crypto transactions across a variety of platforms owned by Facebook, including WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram.In a blanket statement offered by Facebook previously, it only stated, \u201cLike many other companies Facebook is exploring ways to leverage the power of blockchain technology. This new small team is exploring many different applications. We don\u2019t have anything further to share.\u201dOne of the biggest concerns being raised is whether or not Facebook will be able to manage a blockchain solution adequately. Its track record of protecting customer data is anything but stellar and it has repeatedly suffered breaches or internal glitches that have exposed the personal information of millions of its customers. There is nothing to say that the same wouldn\u2019t happen with a blockchain project such as Libra.However, some argue that the only way for Facebook to overcome its issues is by embracing the blockchain. One of these is Henry Liu, a former company employee who is now a managing partner of blockchain investment firm YGC. He argues, \u201cPayments and commerce are Facebook\u2019s only way out from its freemium, advertisement business model.\u201dNote: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

The campaign, #DropGold, has the World Gold Council (WGC) in a frenzy and the group has now responded in an effort to try and prevent any major switches from the precious metal to the precious currency.\u00a0The WGC most likely feels threatened by the solid arguments offered by Grayscale. For example, the DropGold website asserts, \u201cEver tried to pull your weight in gold? We\u2019re living in a digital world, a new financial era where bitcoin is displacing gold. While a gold bar weighs around 25.7 pounds, bitcoin is weightless and can be bought, sold, and transferred as easily as a text message.\u201dIn an effort to support Gold as the real king, WGC Manager of Investment Research Adam Perlaky penned a blog post entitled, \u201cCryptocurrencies are no replacement for gold.\u201d He starts off by saying, \u201cAlthough cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology look promising as a whole, they clearly do not represent a substitute for gold either in theory or in practice\u201d and provides several reasons to support his position. He points out that gold is less volatile, has a liquid market, is traded in according with established regulations and is a \u201csafe-haven investment.\u201dWhat he leaves out is that gold\u2019s value can be\u2014and has been\u2014manipulated time and time again. According to a report by NASDAQ from 2018, \u201cThere are several variations to the theory, but the general belief is that precious metals like gold and silver are under the thumb of central banks and other large banks, which use high frequency trading (HFT) as well as derivatives (aka naked shorts) to tamp down prices. There are also worries about discrepancies between paper gold and physical bullion in systems such as the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) Gold Price.\u201dThat same \u201ccentral bank\u201d is the one that manipulates fiat prices, as well. This was part of the reason Bitcoin was first conceptualized, allowing users to regain control over their money, without relying on central banks or governments that can change values virtually on a whim.At least Perlaky was nice enough to give credit to blockchains and crypto in his post. He concluded that the MGC continues \u201cto acknowledge the innovation taking place in the cryptocurrency and blockchain spaces and believe there will be a role for this technology in the future,\u201d but that they feel that \u201ccryptocurrencies are not a replacement for gold and gold should remain a component in all investment portfolios.\u201dNote: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

In their investigation, they found that hundreds of Samoans were scammed out of their money, and three in particular had lost NZ$28,000 (US$18,500).\u201cIt makes you happy and believe that this is a future for the family,\u201d said one woman, talking about the hopes and dreams their investment gave them. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe anything anymore.\u201dAnother victim told the outlet, \u201cI really want to just put it to a stop, just to the people that have been affected.\u201dSISDAC was tied to the scam because a OneCoin employee used the church \u201cto reach a vast network of would-be investors.\u201d New Zealand authorities specifically accused the church of participating in the scam. OneCoin was banned in Samoa in 2018, and much of the investment seen around SISDAC came after the ban went into place.SISFAC has fired back, publishing a letter on their Facebook page, denying that they knowingly participated in the Ponzi scheme. They denied any participating in the scam, writing:\u201cSISDAC has never knowingly participated or colluded in any way shape or form with any individual or organisation in this type of illegal activity.\u201dNot happy to just deny the accusation, SISDAC is also exploring legal action against the Samoan government for defamation.OneCoin investigations are happening around the world.

The FSC hopes the program will encourage firms with commercial potential by providing a more suitable regulatory environment for testing new products and technologies on consumers, whilst still operating in a live environment.The program, which was launched in January 2018, allows firms up to four years in the sandbox, and the lack of regulatory restrictions makes winning approval a significant advantage for blockchain companies.The regulator said some 105 companies had applied to take part in the program since its launch, and the news that blockchain firms are included within the cohort is another vote of confidence in the huge commercial potential of blockchain. As of May 2, 18 services have already been approved to be tested in the financial regulatory sandbox, according to the FSC.The specific companies included have not yet been specified, though further announcements are expected in the coming days.Regulatory sandbox schemes have become increasingly common, with regulators in jurisdictions worldwide choosing to use a similar, relaxed regulatory environment for blockchain startups.The news from South Korea comes just days after the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced the companies named in its latest regulatory sandbox cohort, where blockchain companies were again overrepresented.Among them, ecommerce payments firm Nuggets and Diro Labs, \u201can identity verification service that can verify any person or document online directly from the original source\u201d, were amongst the blockchain companies to win their place in the sandbox program.During the sandbox period, the Financial Services Commission will work closely with firms to determine the legal boundaries of their testing, while ensuring the firms have room to innovate freely in developing their products.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

Scott Hendry, Bank of Canada Senior Special Director, Financial Technology, said the trial could lead to reduced costs and improved traceability in central bank payments in future. He noted:\u201cThe world of cross-border payments is complicated and expensive: our exploratory journey into the use of DLT to try to reduce some of the costs and improve traceability of these payments has yielded many lessons.\u201cThe importance of international cooperation through projects such as this one cannot be underestimated. Only through continued collaboration and fundamental research will it be possible for this technology to mature and for policy-makers to fully understand its potential.\u201dSopnendu Mohanty, Chief FinTech Officer of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said the next focus was on global central bank cooperation around distributed ledger technology.\u201cThe next wave of central bank blockchain projects can make further progress by bringing technology exploration together with policy questions about the future of cross-border payments. It is challenging work, and we welcome other central banks to join us in this global collaboration, to bring benefit to consumers, businesses and the broader financial industry,\u201d he explained.Cross-border blockchain payments allow parties to transfer funds with quicker, at a lower cost and with more accountability, amongst the many other advantages afforded by the technology.With the first transaction now hailed a success, no doubt more central banks will be looking at their own blockchain research more closely.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

The suit alleges that Kip Warner, who worked briefly with the firm, made false and defamatory statements against the firm.Warner made the statements to one of his associates in the Vancouver Police Department. He also allegedly spread the false information to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The suit was filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. It alleges that Warner either made the statements knowing they were false or \u201calternatively, with reckless indifference to whether they were true or false, and for the main purpose of harming Kevin Hobbs, Lisa Cheng, and their company Vanbex.\u201dIn a press release announcing the suit, Vanbex further pointed to Warner\u2019s history of being a conspiracy theorist. In April last year, he was one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit that accused Google of collecting information on its users without their consent. He is also a 9/11 conspiracy theorist, having written a long public letter to the government accusing a group of bankers with the horrific attacks.The information that Warner gave to the authorities has caused great damage to the company, Vanbex further pointed out:\u201cWarner knew the information he gave them was false and misleading. The suit further alleges that based on false information provided and perpetuated by Mr. Warner, the British Columbia Director of Civil Forfeiture filed a claim against Vanbex. Hobbs and Cheng have vigorously denied the Director\u2019s allegations.\u201dDue to the investigations, Vanbex has falsely been portrayed a crypto scam.The founders, Hobbs and Cheng, concluded by reiterating that they would defend themselves and their employees against the malicious accusations:\u201cVanbex has great employees and great products. We will defend ourselves vigorously with the truth. We will defend our business and the right to do our business. Our company is entirely lawful. We have acted properly. This is an insult to our 26 employees and their hard work.\u201dLast month, Canadian police reportedly froze assets owned by the company as part of its investigation against fraud committed by the firm. As we reported, the founders of the firm were looking at spending time in jail if the fraud claims were proven.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.

The defendant, Reginald Fowler was arrested on April 30 in Chandler, Arizona. According to the two prosecutors, Fowler should be detained as he \u201cposes a serious flight risk and presents a risk of continued economic danger.\u201dIn a filing with the Arizona district court, the prosecutors stated that detention is appropriate since Fowler has significant resources and ties to other countries, has taken steps to impede the investigation and there\u2019s evidence of his involvement in other criminal schemes. The nature of his crime also warrants detention, the prosecutors, Elizabeth Strange and Gary Restaino, pointed out.As we reported on May 1, the New York District Attorney charged Fowler and his partner Ravid Yosef of operating a shadow banking ring for crypto exchanges. The two allegedly opened bank accounts for the exchanges, enabling them to offer fiat services. They failed to obtain money transmitting business license despite handling millions of dollars for the exchanges. Yosef is still at large.In making their case, the prosecutors claimed that the possible long sentence Fowler faces could serve as an incentive to flee the country. The evidence against him is also quite strong, further making him a big flight risk.The prosecutors also believe that Fowler has committed many other crimes for which he is yet to be charged. They include attempting to obtain bank loans by presenting fraudulent documents that inflated his worth. Fowler allegedly presented bond certificates worth billions of dollars which were later found to be fraudulent.In a twist, Fowler is reportedly involved in the $850 million Bitfinex and Tether scandal. A report by The Block alleged that Fowler\u2019s company, Global Trading Solutions was one of the agents linked to Crypto Capital. As we have reported, Crypto Capital is the company alleged to have either stolen or lost $850 million belonging to Bitfinex crypto exchange. The exchange ended up taking some of the cash reserves belonging to Tether, its sister company. The two companies are under investigation by New York\u2019s Attorney General (NYAG).The report further alleges that the investigation by the NYAG is the genesis of Fowler\u2019s indictment. If found guilty, Fowler could provide big clues on the mysterious Bitfinex and Tether case.Note: Tokens on the Bitcoin Core (SegWit) chain are referenced as BTC coins; tokens on the Bitcoin Cash ABC chain are referenced as BCH, BCH-ABC or BAB coins.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) is today the only Bitcoin project that follows the original Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, and that follows the original Satoshi protocol and design.
