What attracted you most to the concept of this digital currency? \nBobby Lee (BL): I first discovered Bitcoin in early 2011, through my brother Charlie. At the time, I remember thinking that this was a cool new concept, the idea of digital currencies. Immediately, I was perplexed as to why this hadn\u2019t been done before; that the simple concept of digital currencies didn\u2019t get invented until 2008. Through the next few months, I finally started to slowly learn about the concepts of decentralization, and challenges of double spending for a digital currency, and how it all finally came together in Bitcoin in 2008. As an investor in gold, I was immediately attracted to the similarities of Bitcoin with Gold, and then also started questioning myself what are the actual underlying reasons why gold is valuable. Is it the color, or properties, or just group-think; What actually made gold valuable? and likewise, what makes Bitcoin valuable?\nEM: Your tweet from earlier today was a bold statement. Can you share why you were prompted to push that out? Perhaps share your thoughts on the recent trends towards private blockchain. \nBL: What prompted that tweet was an event I attended during the day. \u00a0I went to yet another seminar that afternoon, organized by the banking sector, which had different speakers all extolling the virtues of blockchain, decentralized ledgers, and how revolutionary it was. \u00a0Yet almost all of them, either purposely or not, left Bitcoin on the sidelines while talking about blockchains and DLTs as world-changing. I thought to myself, this is mad! \u00a0\nYou can\u2019t blame them, that Bitcoin has had a rough start, with tainted media stories in the last few years. \u00a0However, I do think it\u2019s also the lack of understanding, that lead to this result of people embracing blockchains, wanting to take it private, and at the same time, sort of dismiss Bitcoin.\nFor me, Blockchain is only innovative if we\u2019re referring to its new features invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. \u00a0I believe that for something to qualify as Blockchain, it specifically has to be permission-less. \u00a0It is this permission-less aspect that makes blockchains \u201cpublic\u201d. \u00a0In other words, the innovation is the permission-less and \u201cpublic\u201d nature of blockchain. Consequently, Private Blockchains do not really qualify as \u201cblockchains\u201d by my definition, and therefore is not innovation in the \u201cinvented in 2008\u201d sense. \u00a0Private Blockchains are just merely distributed shared databases, that have been successfully deployed in production since the 1980\u2019s.\nEM: What is the current outlook for Bitcoin in China? \nBL: The outlook is quite exciting. \u00a0There\u2019s lots of interest in Bitcoin in several aspects, as a new technology in the growing space of FinTech, as a store of value in digital assets (in the cloud), as a source of income for businesses venturing into Bitcoin mining, and finally, also as a speculative trading vehicle. \u00a0And most importantly, the central bank itself has declared that they are closely studying the concept of digital currencies, and wants to apply it in practice.\nEM: What has been most significant in shaping your view to support Bitcoin blockchain solutions over private non-Bitcoin blockchain solutions? \nBL: The issue here, what most outsiders don\u2019t fully understand yet, is that you want Blockchain to be immutable. \u00a0Immutability is also a key tenant of the new Blockchain concept. In other words, it is the immutability that makes Blockchain special and different from anything that came before it. \u00a0Well then, how do you get immutability? \u00a0The way to do it is to have a very strong Blockchain, that is decentralized and very difficult for someone to take over. \u00a0Today, only the Bitcoin Blockchain satisfies that criteria, because it\u2019s the most dominant blockchain, in both market circulation value terms, as well as raw Proof-of-Work computational hashing power. \u00a0And what is unfortunate for all other blockchains and AltCoins, is that Bitcoin\u2019s lead here is insurmountable, and it\u2019s a self-reinforcing cycle. \u00a0Personally, I see no other outcome than Bitcoin being more and more as The ONLY Blockchain that matters. \u00a0All other interested and application-specific blockchains would (and should) need to anchor to Bitcoin, sort of like sidechain solutions. \u00a0\nEM: What must be done to keep Bitcoin current in a dialogue with more and more push towards private non-Bitcoin blockchains? \nBL: I don\u2019t think anything needs to be done per se. \u00a0If what I say is right, then those who venture off the path will eventually realize the mistakes, and come back and anchor their blockchains onto the main Bitcoin Blockchain. \u00a0Let them go figure it out. \u00a0I\u2019m just trying to improve awareness and do some education here, based on my observations and learnings over the past few years. \u00a0\n\nPrivate Blockchains reminds me of Private Intranets. \u00a0Private Intranets sound great, but they\u2019re ultimately really not useful unless they\u2019re connected to the Public Internet. \u00a0So for Private Blockchains, they should consider anchoring to the public Bitcoin Blockchain, to achieve real immutability.\n\nEM: What do you see as the killer use case for Bitcoin where private non-Bitcoin blockchains will not measure up? \nBL: The killer use case of Bitcoin is money. \u00a0Yes, transfer of value, digitally, using blockchain. \u00a0Over here at BTCC, we have a very exciting new wallet coming up, call Mobi. \u00a0We think this is the killer use case for Bitcoin, to use Bitcoin as real money. \u00a0Mobi will be global money: for Anyone, at Anywhere, in Any Currency. \u00a0\u201cBitcoin as Money\u201d, it\u2019s the killer use case that\u2019s been hiding in plain sight.\nSo Much Potential\nBitcoin community members and leaders like Lee caution a flight to more temporarily \u201cflashy\u201d concepts and to understand and grasp the potential of Bitcoin. There frankly is much-untapped potential that a public blockchain provides. During our interview Lee noted: \n\u201cPrivate Blockchains reminds me of Private Intranets. \u00a0Private Intranets sound great, but they\u2019re ultimately really not useful unless they\u2019re connected to the Public Internet. \u00a0So for Private Blockchains, they should consider anchoring to the public Bitcoin Blockchain, to achieve real immutability.\u201d \nAccording to Lee, Bitcoin just cannot be left out of the equation, especially when discussing blockchain solutions to change the world. Lee shared what prompted him to tweet: \n\nWhat prompted that tweet was an event I attended during the day. \u00a0I went to yet another seminar that afternoon, organized by the banking sector, which had different speakers all extolling the virtues of blockchain, decentralized ledgers, and how revolutionary it was. \u00a0Yet almost all of them, either purposely or not, left Bitcoin on the sidelines while talking about blockchains and DLTs as world-changing. I thought to myself, this is mad!\n\nOf course, anyone can develop a private blockchain solution, but Bitcoin continues to not only serve as an alternative currency but a public blockchain with the essential trait of immutability. \nWhat are your thoughts on private blockchains?

However it decided to temporarily remove the service in order to upgrade its blockchain.\nWhen the anonymous system\u2019s first iteration was running, the developers were so confident of its ability to disconnect the link between sender and receiver that they offered a bounty to\u00a0anyone who could trace a transaction.\nThe system was never cracked and so the bounty\u00a0remains unclaimed.\nNavTech\u2019s Quest for True Anonymity\n Navcoin recently brought back the anonymous send system called NavTech in an official launch on November 1, 2016. However, there is still 5 weeks of testing to go before the anon network is fully decentralized, the open source code is released and the public can add their own servers to the network.\nOn September 26, developers released the NavTech White Paper\u00a0which explains the technology in detail. The NavTech system boasts what developers said\u00a0is a groundbreaking dual-blockchain architecture that removes any link between coins the sender sends, to those that are received.\nThe Navcoin team believes they have found a way to create a digital currency as private as real cash. However, they openly admit that up until now, this doesn\u2019t mean much until the platform is fully decentralized.\nThe new NavTech Decentralization White Paper 2016 labeled The Unbreakable Code lays out why decentralization is so important \u2014 while banks would say otherwise.\nNavcoin operates as a self-sustaining entity providing open source code, freely distributed, with systems in place that reward and facilitate trust. Users are free to use and operate the network in whatever way they think best.\nIn the ever-increasing interest and demand for anonymous digital currencies, a\u00a0few have risen to the top and attained community acceptance. Anonymous currencies such as Monero, DASH, Zcash and ShadowCash SDC are at the top of the list. Now Navcoin looks to join these currencies in the quest to offer users a way to financially conduct anonymous transactions with 100% privacy.\nTransparency Key to Navcoin Philosophy\nSome still have reservations about\u00a0accepting\u00a0Navcoin, as\u00a0it has\u00a0been through four iterations since its inception. When we reached out to Navcoin community members about this, here was the response;\nNavcoin had a delay on the launch of anonymous features due to them being part of the plan to enhance the usability of the platform. Developers included some features in the code like bip38 allowing Navcoin to have \u201dthin\u201d wallets, Android wallet etc., in order to do that we had to hardfork\u2026\nWhen hard fork took place, it was done through Bittrex, price started to increase, then at Poloniex since people moved coins to Bittrex which created a large unrealistic spike in price, at that time it peaked at 16k satoshi, Poloniex then took a while to update to the new version, subsequently the price went down, eventually they updated their network.\nAdditionally there was a large spike in price when Monero XMR was \u201daccepted\u201d into \u201cDarkmarkets\u201d, peaking at around 11k satoshi, since then price has corrected.\nNavcoin was never PRE-MINED, it never needed an ICO to attract venture capital and supporters have never dumped, if you look at the rich list it remains unchanged.\nNavcoin Goes Where No Coin Has Gone Before\nAs with many digital currencies before it, Navcoin has faced some challenges. However, it now seems\u00a0developers finally have things ironed out, and are making progress. The are detailing the step-by-step actions required\u00a0to transform Navcoin into what they claim is one of the best privacy-focused digital currencies and technologies to date. It will have many new dynamic features including NavTech Anonymous Send, Subchain as a Service, a\u00a0GUI wallet, an\u00a0Ambassador Program, and much more.\nThe plan is for Navcoin to perform almost instant transactions at a rate of up to 13,000 per-second, with\u00a0blocks scalable to 20MB\u00a0and 30 seconds between blocks.\nNavcoin developers, along with dedicated community members, believe privacy in any financial transaction is an individual\u2019s democratic right. The NavTech White Paper\u00a0contains a complete technical breakdown of how this works, for interested readers.\nNavcoin has also been added to Coin Payments merchant gateway system, allowing online and offline merchants to accept Navcoin. Its\u00a0integration into the merchant gateway with NavTech System\u00a0allows\u00a0anonymous purchasing of products and services.\nNavcoin plans to\u00a0release its \u201cSubchain as a Service\u201d feature. The team is currently in talks with other project developers regarding \u201cNavTech\u201d and \u201cSubchain as a Service\u201d integration.\nMuch Progress So Far, but More to Come\nTo sum it all up, Navcoin aims to blaze\u00a0a new trail in the world of anonymous digital currencies and have come a long way since its beginning. The Navcoin team has faced some challenges along the way but have remained\u00a0steadfast. The result is\u00a0a seemingly impressive anonymous, decentralized currency \u2014 as well as resources for users to create a completely private and secure network environment.\nWhat do you think of NavTech, and anonymous cryptocurrency platforms in general?

The company boasts over 3,700 cars in Rome, providing more than 10 million cab\u00a0services each year.\nAlso read: France\u2019s Third Largest Bus Company Accepts Bitcoin\u00a0\nAbout RadioTaxi 3570\nCreated in November 1968 by a little more than 100 founding members, RadioTaxi 3570 is \u201cthe Roman radio cab cooperative belonging to Roman taxi drivers who want to be part of it,\u201d states its website.\nThe company claims to have the lowest price in all of Europe. Its switchboard receives roughly 30,000 calls daily, 7,000 of which are from foreign tourists.\nRadioTaxi 3570 is ISO 9001 certified and is the first taxi organization in Italy to obtain quality certification. It also received the ICT Innovation Prize 2010 and ICT Innovation Prize 2012. The company claims:\n\n\u201cIt [Radiotaxi 3570] is the largest Italian organization in the sector and the largest radio cab cooperative in Europe.\u201d\n\nBitcoin Accepted\nBitcoin is listed under \u2018Payment methods\u2019 alongside credit card, Bancomat, and PayPal as one of the \u201ccommitments that Cooperativa RadioTaxi 3570 takes towards its clients,\u201d according to its website.\nPayment in bitcoin is made possible, thanks to Chainside, a startup enabling businesses to accept bitcoin. In September, Chainside formed \u00a0a partnership with the Italian Union of Radio Cabs (URI) and its founder, Loreno Bittarelli, to offer wallet, invoice, and monitoring services. Bittarelli is also president of RadioTaxi 3570.\nThe Chainside platform is integrated into URI\u2019s booking app for smartphones and tablets, IT Taxi. RadioTaxi 3570 is also using this app. Users booking a trip connect to IT Taxi for price and route calculations. Customers paying in bitcoin are redirected to a page on Chainside. Once payment is received, confirmation is sent back to IT Taxi.\nTaxi Hackathon\nThe partnership with Chainside is not the first time that URI and RadioTaxi 3570 have explored a bitcoin payment option. In June 2015, they co-hosted a hackathon for the industry at\u00a0RadioTaxi 3570\u2019s media room in Rome. TaxiHack\u00a0was the first hackathon for innovations dedicated to taxi service. The 48-hour event was organized by URI in partnership with Codemotion.\nThe winner of the hackathon was BitTaxi, an app that allows customers to pay\u00a0for rides in bitcoin. \u201cOur team has been working to create an integrated module in itTaxi,\u201d the company\u2019s website states. Bittarelli commented after the hackathon:\n\n\u201cOf course, to think that everyone can accept being paid in Bitcoin is hard to imagine, but what we want to walk from this initiative is that we are not as conservative and opposed to innovation as we often describe. We have always seen innovation as a growth stimulus. We want to give a strong signal to our competitors.\u201d\n\nOnce BitTaxi\u2019s bitcoin payment module for IT Taxi is complete, URI and RadioTaxi 3570 will have more than one way to accept bitcoin. The app is used by both RadioTaxi 3570 and URI taxis. While the former\u00a0has 3,700 cars, the latter\u00a0has 12,000 members operating in approximately 50 cities throughout Italy. According to Bittarelli, IT Taxi app \u201chas now been extended to over 50 cities across the nation.\u201d\nWhat do you think of\u00a0RadioTaxi 3570 accepting bitcoin? let us know in the comments section below.\n\nImages courtesy of Shutterstock, 3570.it, IT Taxi, BitTaxi, URI\n\nThere are no bigger Bitcoin believers than the Bitcoin.com team.

Notaries are a kind of semi-centralized set of databases in\u00a0liberal democracies today. Importantly, they keep tabs on who owns what (or try to, anyway).\nWithout notaries, \u201cproperty rights\u201d \u2014\u00a0a\u00a0key tenet in\u00a0both free market-oriented societies and classical liberalism \u2014 would not be possible. For property rights to be respected, there must be\u00a0some way of proving\u00a0who owns what and making sure there is no\u00a0fraud or double spending. This includes verifying a user\u2019s identity in a viable legal manner, one of Signatura\u2019s focuses.\nHow Users Can Trust Websites \u2014 In Theory\nThe internet shares a similar infrastructure, with its\u00a0certificate authorities (CAs). These are organizations that streamline the credibility of other sites. Like a stamp of approval, organizations like Verisign put their name on the line to verify that your website\u2019s HTTPS encrypted tunnel actually is routing to your server.\u00a0That is their job, anyway.\nYour browser, in turn, looks at these certificates and decides whether to show you a green lock or a red warning. This is essential to user experience.\n\nCAs attempt to do for secure communications what Bitcoin\u00a0does for money. That is, provide a secure record of who owns what, so cheating becomes very difficult.\nIf a CA fails, man-in-the-middle\u00a0attacks become possible. It\u2019s likely websites with critical information flowing\u00a0through them, like banks, would suffer from impersonators.\n\nSome of these CAs are so big, centralized and vulnerable to government and corporate pressure that they even occasionally\u00a0comply with man-in-the-middle\u00a0attacks.\nBitcoin Blockchain Great for Managing Notary Services\nBitcoin\u2019s decentralization, immutability, and massive hashrate make it an obvious candidate for managing these services. The team at Signatura understands this.\nAnd\u00a0they are not the only ones. Blockstack, Factom, Emercoin and Ubiquity are also organizations developing Bitcoin or blockchain-based notarization and authentication.\nSignatura\u2019s focus seems to be towards individual and institutional authentication, particularly for\u00a0individuals in critical and official government roles.\nFranco Amati, Signatura co-founder, told Bitcoin.com:\n\u201cDigital signatures are used in a wide range of industries, from legal to financial services. But we also see potential in education, where we are already working with career diplomas, and in government, where transparency has an important role. In fact, we are already in talks with local counties to start using the platform.\u201d\n\nHow Signatura\u2019s Authentication\u00a0Works\nLike traditional digital signature authorities and CAs,\u00a0Signatura has its own\u00a0public key that it uses to sign documents its users want to authenticate. While this signature provides some credibility, at the end of the day it\u2019s\u00a0not the only thing that matters.\nUsers can choose who\u00a0co-signs their documents. This can be anyone they trust or is reputable, be it their\u00a0lawyer, their business partner\u2026 Or their mom. Anyone can create an account at Signatura.co and become cosigners.\nUser identity verification happens\u00a0with private/public key cryptography similar to Bitcoin\u2019s, as well as through connections with a user\u2019s social media \u2014 like Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin. In this sense, Signatura is\u00a0quite similar to Onename.com, one of the first to offer\u00a0a blockchain authentication service.\nFollowing the security model Blockchain.info pioneered, Signatura provides users a master seed and encrypts it with a password. If users forget the password they can restore from the seed. If they lose both,\u00a0however,\u00a0they will permanently lose access.\nUser Credits to Access Signatura Services\nSignatura is currently\u00a0developing an\u00a0API, to\u00a0serve institutional and larger organizations and not just small businesses and other independent users.\nIt is not open source either, at least not yet. When asked about it, Amati added:\n\n\u201cWe have plans to open source Signatura web platform itself, but not its API, at least not yet.\u201d\n\nNew\u00a0users will\u00a0receive\u00a0a positive balance of 10 credits. These are to access Signatura resources and sign transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. Users\u00a0can purchase further credits\u00a0to access more services later on. However, users cannot exchange credits with each other,\u00a0and so credits do not trade on the\u00a0open market.\n\u201cFurthermore, we plan to support current credentials, not only using ECDSA (secp256k1) as this beta but also RSA (like most existing certificates),\u201d Signatura told press. \u201cFor that, we are working with Rootstock (RSK Labs, our next-door office neighbors) to have RSA opcodes on their smart contract platform.\u201d\nWhat do you think of Signatura and blockchain notary services? Will this take off in the future? Let us know in the comments.\u00a0\n\nImages via Shutterstock, Signatura\n\nBitcoin.com is the most unique online destination in the bitcoin universe.

Meanwhile, interest in Bitcoin is growing, and volumes have been steadily rising in the Central Asian country.\nAlso read:\u00a0France\u2019s Third Largest Bus Company Accepts Bitcoin\nKazakhstan\u2019s Currency Problems\nThe Central Asian country was the last Soviet republic to declare independence back in 1991 when the USSR fell. With above-average oil reserves and a 2014 GDP of about $420 billion, Kazakhstan has the largest and strongest performing economy in Central Asia.\nWith strong economic outlook, Kazakhstan\u2019s local currency, the tenge (KZT) by all means should be doing better than its neighbors. However, it keeps falling year after year due to a variety of reasons, including corruption and oil prices.\n\nOver the winter, the KZT hit its record low against the dollar and lately it has been declining again. With the currency falling almost 70% since the 2008 financial crisis began, the citizens\u2019\u00a0savings have been hit hard, and many are looking for safer ways to save.\nKazakhstan Warming Towards Crypto\nFor centuries the Kazakhs have followed Russian culture and politics closely, and, when Russia tried to outlaw cryptocurrencies, so did Kazakhstan. Then-head of the National Bank of Kazakhstan, Kairat Kelimbetov, suggested in 2014 that the National Bank might \u201cdesignate Bitcoin a form of financial pyramid scheme.\u201d\nDaniyar Akishev\nThankfully, as Russia finds itself loosening their policy, it appears that Kazakhstan is\u00a0as well as\u00a0Kelimbetov\u2019s successor, Daniyar Akishev, is far more progressive on the subject.\n\u201cThis is a reality with which we will come up against in the very near future, and ignoring it is not possible,\u201d Akishev said in June, as he admitted that blockchains might be useful for the country. \u201cWe are considering the possibility of using the blockchain system, either on the stock exchange or in other areas of payment services.\u201d\nThere is no full Kazakhstan bitcoin exchange yet, but KZT trades on LocalBitcoins and a few smaller exchanges in the region. More importantly, a bitcoin advocacy center, Bitcoin Kazakhstan, has opened in the country\u2019s largest city, Almaty, to provide consulting, training, business networking, mining, and other services to any Kazakh in person or online. Their stated goal is \u201cto assist in promoting the use of Bitcoin in the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\u201d\nSet up by Boris Komarov in 2014, the center has been increasing its consultancy and intermediary services over time. Komarov told EurasiaNet:\nPeople are slowly getting to know Bitcoin and crypto-currencies, but very slowly. They need better education, which is why I created the first Bitcoin course in Russian for beginners and established First Bitcoin Center to help them. But so far, not many people are asking for help.\nThe bitcoin infrastructure is improving as well. In December, Almaty received its first Bitcoin ATM machine. Owner Kanat Amrenov admits that there isn\u2019t enough Bitcoin traffic for\u00a0it to be profitable yet, but his prime location in the business capital of the country should help boost its popularity, and he hopes to be profitable by fall before buying even more machines.\nDo you think bitcoin adoption will keep growing in\u00a0Kazakhstan?

And if it doesn\u2019t make you want to buy bitcoins (or wish you had more), then perhaps nothing will.\nAlso read: Leading Dark Net Markets to Support Monero\nEconomic Stimulus 101\nIn simple, easy to understand language, this video \u2013 which is just over one minute in length \u2013 gives a simple economics 101 lesson on how economic stimulus works; on the different schools of thoughts; and on when \u2013 and if \u2013 state intervention in the economy is necessary. Warning: the video might not leaving you feeling any better off about the economy than before.\nAs the video goes:\n\u201cCentral banks can try to stimulate the economy. Central banks do it by lowering interest rates in order to make it cheaper to borrow money, on one hand, and on the other hand they can even inject money directly into the system through monetary easing [. . .] The main question is, \u2018Should they?\u2019\u201d\nThe video goes on to explain the positions of two opposing camps of economic thought: the Keynesians and Austrians.\nKeynesian economists believe that central bank and government intervention can push a struggling economy into a real recovery, while Austrians believe that such intervention does more harm than good.\n\u201cQuite frankly,\u201d the video says, \u201ceconomists don\u2019t yet know what needs to be done after a crisis.\u201d\nBitcoins please\u2026\nThe Siliver Lining of the Financial\u00a0Crisis\nBitcoin, according to many proponents, was created in part as a solution to the uncertain mechanisms of the US and global economy. It\u2019s deflationary protocol ensures that, instead of losing value over time like many fiat currencies, Bitcoin increases in value over time as fewer coins are mined each block over decades. The fungible nature of Bitcoin allows users to easily trade bitcoins for goods and services. Like the video featured in this article, many other videos have been important to Bitcoin\u2019s history, such as one found here.\nThere are many nuances about how the global economy truly works. One of the most fascinating aspects of the global economics has been Bitcoin in recent years, and in many ways the digital currency \u2013 which was created\u00a0in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto \u2013 was created as a response to the problem described in this video. \nIn the 2016 election, Bitcoin has played a role, as Gary Johnson accepts Bitcoin on his campaign website, thus betokening the positive impact Bitcoin could have on everyday life.\nYou can watch the video here:\n\nIs Bitcoin the next phase in the evolution of money?

Stolfi wrote:\nSatoshi expected the number of transactions per day to grow less than 20% per year. Taking that as a measure of the value of all payments done using bitcoin, that prediction would imply that the price would increase less than 20% per year.\nAny comments recommending inflation or flexible money supply are likely to be anathema to Bitcoin traders and long-term holders \u2013 as well as sound-money economists, who see Bitcoin\u2019s 21 million BTC upper limit as integral to its value and viability as a currency.\nStolfi\u2019s comments received several replies in support and opposition, with one suggesting that if inflation were automated and kept very low (eg 1%) it would avoid the kind of government interference that has seen fiat currency buying power plunge over the decades.\nBane of Bitcoiners\nThe professor has made contentious comments about Bitcoin price speculation in the past, most recently when he opposed a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) listing in a written submission to the US SEC.\u00a0He said Bitcoin tokens are \u201cshares for a company with no assets, no products and no staff\u201d.\nHe has also suggested that Bitcoin is way overpriced even now, and that holders expecting long-term riches and wild price fluctuations make Bitcoin unattractive as money.\nIf You Were Satoshi\u2026\nStolfi\u2019s latest remarks were in response to a Reddit post asking readers how they would have improved Bitcoin and possibly avoided today\u2019s mining centralization, if they were Satoshi and could start from scratch.\nControversial suggestions from other readers included: making the original proof-of-work algorithm more resistant to ASICs (like Scrypt), and opposing views such as increasing block sizes or even setting the entire protocol in stone from the beginning, meaning it could never be altered.\nMany readers, however, said they were happy with the original Bitcoin as it is, and any improvements could be made in time if required.\n[Note: The views reported in this article are not necessarily endorsed by the author or Bitcoin.com.]\nDid Professor Stolfi make valid, if unpopular, suggestions? Could Bitcoin have been improved from the beginning, or is it perfect as-is?\n\nImages courtesy of\u00a0Pixabay,\u00a0topmeaning.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Share this story:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Tags in this story\n                \n\nCentralization, Jorge Stolfi, protocol \n\n\n\n                    Related\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCraig Wright Ordered to Produce a List of Early Bitcoin Addresses in Kleiman Lawsuit                    \n\n\n\t\t            NEWS | 23 hours ago \n\n\t\t\t\t\tOn April 28, the high profile Kleiman v.

Creditors, not Bitfinex, are the ones who get to decide whether to socialize losses.\u00a0\nAlso read: Is Bitcoin Ready for the Next Global Financial Crisis?\nSocialized Losses? Not So Fast\nBitfinex, a bitcoin exchange based in Hong Kong, was hacked last week and suffered a loss of roughly $70M USD. The company appears insolvent after announcing a loss of roughly 36-37 percent of its assets. Bitfinex has since stated that they intend to \u201csocialize\u201d these losses, meaning they expect creditors (anyone with any form of BTC funds at the exchange) to share in the losses equally.\nHowever, under Hong Kong law, Bitfinex will not be able to force creditors to accept its proposal.\u00a0Unlike in the US and Japan, Hong Kong does not have a system of bankruptcy protection to facilitate a Bitfinex reorganization. By arguing that Bitfinex is insolvent, creditor lawsuits could force Bitfinex into liquidation where creditors can take control.\u00a0\nHow Will Bitfinex Differ from MtGox?\nMtGox had more opportunities at restructuring than Bitfinex will.\u00a0 This is because Japan adopted a US-style system of insolvency protection, providing companies the equivalent to filing for \u201cChapter 11\u201d. A Chapter 11-style bankruptcy filing benefits companies in three basic ways: \n\nfiling activates the \u201cautomatic stay\u201d provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, which stops lawsuits and turns them into bankruptcy claims; \nnon-accepting creditors will be bound to the reorganization plan approved by the court and;\nmanagement remains in place. \n\nSimilar protections gave MtGox room to breathe when financial pressure became too great in 2014.\u00a0 With creditors held at bay, MtGox\u2019s management had some time to seek financing, formulate a plan to repay creditors and emerge from bankruptcy profitable.\u00a0 In March and April 2014 numerous parties approached MtGox and its court-appointed trustee with rehabilitation plans.\u00a0 But despite intense arguments favoring rehabilitation MtGox opted to liquidate the company instead. \nHong Kong, however, does not have a Chapter 11-style system, and as a result, Bitfinex is essentially at the mercy of creditors.\u00a0 Creditors owed at least $10,000 HKD can petition the court to wind-up (liquidate) Bitfinex if their debt remains unpaid for three weeks following written statutory demand.\u00a0 Unlike at MtGox, Bitfinex\u2019s creditors do not have to patiently wait in the dark while the CEO hears rehabilitation proposals for months.\u00a0\nWhat If Creditors Petition to Liquidate Bitfinex?\n\nOnce in liquidation, lawsuits against Bitfinex would be stayed, management removed, and a trustee appointed to preserve assets. Creditors would then have some time to organize and consider alternative proposals before deciding whether the court should handle the job.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nA competitor exchange might emerge,\u00a0offering distribute assets to creditors, as Kraken did with MtGox. It is possible for creditors to approve of such a plan and have the court appointed liquidator removed, speeding up the distribution.\u00a0\nBitfinex has one main legal mechanism to use against creditors seeking to liquidate it: petition the court for a \u201cscheme of arrangement\u201d, which is essentially a court-enforced agreement between the Bitfinex and the creditors.\u00a0 But 75% of creditors must agree on the scheme and the court must approve it.\u00a0\nDue to the associated legal expenses and complexity involved, smaller companies often just come to informal workout agreements with creditors.\u00a0Bitfinex\u2019s creditors are diverse and are scattered across the globe.\u00a0Unless Bitfinex can organize support for its socialized losses plan across a diverse set of creditors, dissenting creditors may be able to decide its fate. \u00a0 \u00a0\nWill Bitcoin\u2019s Unique Attributes Affect the Plan?\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nThe fluid nature of Bitcoin is a factor.\u00a0Despite the socialized losses plan, there is a risk that Bitfinex could repay aggressive creditors in full to stop their liquidation petitions and buy time to continue operations.\u00a0\nIn theory, payments by an insolvent Bitfinex to these creditors would be clawed back by court order once a creditor\u2019s petition to wind-up the company is accepted.\u00a0 But in practice, clawing back payments appears hard to enforce here.\u00a0 Most of the creditors are not located in Hong Kong, do not have assets there and know how to use Bitcoin to move their funds quickly. Aggressive creditors with minimal ties to Hong Kong might threaten liquidation to game the system and get a greater repayment.\u00a0\nUnless Bitfinex can give assurances they are dealing with all creditors at arm\u2019s length, this factor might eventually convince creditors and the court that it is best to have a court-appointed liquidator take custody of the assets. \nWhat Else Can Bitfinex Offer to Save Itself?\n\nWhen news of the scale of MtGox\u2019s insolvency first reached the Internet, things seemed hopeless.\u00a0My idea was for MtGox to perform a debt-equity swap with creditors: have creditors trade their claim for shares in a newly capitalized MtGox under new management.\u00a0 This was the fastest way to push the company to solvency and create a true incentive for creditors to want MtGox\u2019s survival.\u00a0The idea was well received and\u00a0could at some point be considered by Bitfinex. \nBitfinex was a successful exchange with fewer problems than MtGox.\u00a0We can\u2019t yet be sure, but the loss may have been caused by mistakes implementing BitGo\u2019s multi-signature wallet system and not due to ordinary exchange operations.\u00a0If this is the case, then Bitfinex does not appear to have suffered from systemic issues like MtGox, and perhaps returning to the previous cold-wallet system would restore consumer confidence.\u00a0 \nIf pressure from creditors builds over the coming weeks, offering some large creditors an option to trade their claim for shares in the exchange could be one way to balance Bitfinex\u2019s books and rally creditors behind the company.\nDo you think Bitfinex has a future?\u00a0Do you agree with its socialized losses plan?

Daily Mail\u00a0reports that he has been convicted and sentenced to 11 years behind bars. \nAlso read:\u00a0Coinsource Becomes Largest BTM Provider in the\u00a0U.S.\nRyan Kennedy: Crypto Scammer Turned Rapist\nThe 29 year-old was found guilty of controlling women via emotional manipulation, destroying their self-confidence and self-identity before violently raping them over nearly a decade.\nAs he raped her, one of his victims \u201cscreamed and cried.\u201d He then forced her to apologize for \u201cruining his fun.\u201d Kennedy brutally rapped another of his traumatized victims as \u201cpunishment.\u201d Kennedy threatened to hurt her more if she screamed.\nA third women said Kennedy threatened to leave her if she did not let him penetrate her.\nKennedy worked as an office worker in Bristol at the time of his arrest in February.\n\u201cThe phrase \u2018coercive control\u2019 was coined to describe a situation where one person in a relationship, over a period of time, overshadows and eventually takes over control of the other person,\u201d Judge Jamie Tabor QC said. \u201cThe premiere feature is that the victims are made to feel guilty if they don\u2019t do as they are told.\u201d \nHe added, \u201cCoercive controllers are often highly narcissistic and inevitably selfish.\u00a0If told by other[s] that is how they are viewed, they are always abrupt.\u00a0You are a controller, and like most controllers you pick on members of the opposite sex and those that are vulnerable.\u201d\n11 of the 14 charges Kennedy faced were for rape. A two-week trial saw Kennedy acquitted of three counts and eight were left to lay on file. The jury found him guilty of raping three women between 2008 and 2015.\n\u201cThese rapes took place within the context of what was described as controlling, abusive and manipulative relationships,\u201d prosecutor Fiona Elder said.\nOne victim described herself as screaming and crying during the intercourse. She said the intercourse was forceful painful. She asked him to stop. Kennedy, instead of stopping, criticized her for \u201cruining his fun.\u201d He made her apologize before she went to the bathroom.\nAfter having surgery, one woman told Kennedy she did not want to have sex with him.\n\u201cShe gave the reasons why she did not want to have sex at that time but she said it was a case of submission,\u201d Ms. Elder said. \u201cHe threatened to leave her if she did not submit to his sexual advances.\u201d\nKennedy, as he raped another woman as \u201cpunishment,\u201d told her that if she made too much noise he was \u201creally going to hurt her.\u201d\nKennedy\u2019s sadomasochistic ways were discussed in court. Kennedy used sadomasochistic sex as punishment. Often he grew angry for no apparent reason. He would forcefully penetrate victims so hard, they would bleed.\n\u201cShe tried not to make too much noise. She was told that if she screamed he was really going to hurt her,\u201d the prosecutor told. \nKennedy will serve two terms of four years and one of three years to all run consecutively.\nKennedy has a long history of crime, including of the white collar variety. Known as \u201cthe guy who ruined Dogecoin,\u201d he preyed upon cryptocurrency users in addition to women. Kennedy ran Moolah, a Dogecoin trading platform, where he was accused of stealing more than 750 bitcoins and over a million US dollars from Moolah customers.\nOperating under the alias Alex Green, Kennedy gave away dogecoin on Reddit and other forums. He often tipped people hundreds and even thousands of dollars worth of dogecoin to strangers for no reason. He apparently gave liberally to the Dogecoin charity campaigns. Kennedy gave $2,450 worth of dogecoin to a cancer charity and $2,927 to support the Dogecoin branded NASCAR.\nKennedy then asked Dogecoin supporters to invest in Moolah.

They also claimed that the company was rapidly expanding and that their development team was working on a prototype Doge ATM,\u201d one of Moolah\u2019s investors \u00a0told Motherboard. \u201cBecause the Dogecoin community was based so wholly on generosity, we were like sheep to the slaughter.\u201d\nWith partners fronting money, Kennedy purchased Mintpal, a crypto-currency exchange, but immediately it and Moolah had financial difficulties. Kennedy took Mintpal online citing a critical bug. Soon thereafter \u2013 as the internet began uncovering Kennedy\u2019s darker side, which includes spying on women\u2019s dressing rooms- users were out $2-$4 million in funds. Kennedy cited critical bugs.

The lawyers had been hopeful Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Mary Pooler would throw out the case after they filed a motion to dismiss in May.\nCentral to Espinoza\u2019s defense was the notion that Bitcoin is not defined as money or even a currency under Florida law.\nMoney Expert\u2019s Testimony\nAlso central was the expert testimony of Dr. Charles Evans, Associate Professor of Economics and Finance at Barry University, and Executive Director of the Conscious Entrepreneurship Foundation.\nCharles Evans\nDr. Evans was approached as a digital currency expert by Mr. Espinoza\u2019s attorney Rene Palomino. His history in the field goes back way further than Bitcoin, having been a promoter of projects like eCash in the early 1990s.\nA self-described \u201cmoneypunk\u201d, Evans\u2019 initial interest in digital currencies lay in their potential to allow developing countries to issue e-commodities backed by gold, oil or others.\nAlthough eCash never took off, he remained fascinated by its nature and what it or similar technologies could do. He continued his work in the field, studying Bitcoin after it emerged in 2009, publishing his research in peer-reviewed journals and speaking at various conferences on money transmission, banking and financial education.\nWhat the Ruling Means for the Future\nSpeaking to Bitcoin.com, Dr. Evans said things had improved since 2014. Espinoza\u2019s case had dragged on for two and a half years, and, although Evans was hired to testify in one other federal case involving Bitcoin in that time, he doesn\u2019t predict many other such money-defining trials in the near future. He said:\nIt seems to be getting better, step by step. FinCEN officials issued their Guidance in March of 2013, IRS officials in 2014; SEC and CFTC officials took positive steps in 2015\u2014I even have some Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) shares in my private pension account (IRA)\u2014and since then, officials at the Federal Reserve, IMF, Bank of England, Bank for International Settlements, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, etc. have had moderately positive things to say about Bitcoin.\nRegulators in other states, such as Texas, Kansas, New Hampshire, Tennessee and even Florida had also made statements since 2014 saying buying and selling bitcoins for one\u2019s own inventory is not money transmission. Florida, however, required an actual case to make a definite judgment.\nWhile the recent collapse of exchange Cryptsy could potentially be another interesting case for Florida, it would be contingent on the company\u2019s absent founder being located and returning to the US.\nGood News for South Florida Bitcoiners\n\nThe case is good news for bitcoin entrepreneurs in South Florida, who can use the case as a precedent \u2013 and also enjoy other local advantages, like proximity to several foreign countries and Miami\u2019s reputation as an international trade, transport, tourism and banking center.\nThe developing economies of Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Jamaica, Venezuela and others are close by and Miami is home to large expat populations of all.\nSouth Florida is now the place to be, Evans added, comparing it to other US technology centers.\nIf you like high taxes, expensive housing, and terrible traffic, Silicon Valley is ideal. Likewise, if you like being in the middle of a tornado-infested prairie, then Austin is a good choice. If, on the other hand, you like warm winters, amazing coffee, and no personal state income tax, then Miami or Fort Lauderdale might be more to your liking. It really is a matter of personal preferences.\nBitcoin skills are in increasing demand worldwide, he said, and places like Panama, the UK and even China could attract talent.\nIt\u2019ll Get Weirder, But Hold the Trolling\nDr. Evans said that \u201cmany 1990s moneypunks botched it\u00a0beyond redemption,\u201d eventually suffering under stifling laws like the USA PATRIOT Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Bitcoin\u2019s online\u00a0peanut gallery aren\u2019t helping today by appearing unprofessional and childish, though, and engaging in \u201ccringe-worthy\u201d public spats with those working in the industry.\nSimply being unorthodox, even strange, in\u00a0Bitcoin and\u00a0attitude to regulation,\u00a0will push boundaries\u00a0if participants are actually prepared to act.\n\u201cAs long as one has skin in the game, then one is justified saying whatever one feels like saying,\u201d he added.\u00a0\u201cErik Voorhees is probably the politest anarchist that I have met, and Roger Ver has more than paid his dues. One has to respect someone who actually leaves a place that one finds unpleasant, rather than wallow in a puddle of one\u2019s own unhappiness.\u201d\nAs Evans has told Federal Reserve bank examiners, bank executives, state legislators and academics, \u201cwelcome to the 21st century. It only gets weirder from here\u201d.\n\u201cMr. Espinoza\u2019s victory just might have made the slope a little bit slipperier.\u201d\nWhat are Miami\u2019s chances of becoming bitcoin capital of the USA? Would you move to a new city/country if it had friendlier bitcoin regulation?\n\nImages courtesy of\u00a0Pixabay,\u00a0miamiherald.com,\u00a0southflorida.pl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Share this story:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Tags in this story\n                \n\nCharles Evans, Espinoza, Florida, miami, Money Laundering \n\n\n\n                    Related\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCraig Wright Ordered to Produce a List of Early Bitcoin Addresses in Kleiman Lawsuit                    \n\n\n\t\t            NEWS | 23 hours ago \n\n\t\t\t\t\tOn April 28, the high profile Kleiman v.

In the subreddit r/BTC, he noted that this time he would speak to a JRE audience nearly double the size the last time he was on. \nHe wrote:\n\n\u201cI have been invited to go on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast for the fourth time. Please join me, live, on September 7th. The JRE podcast now has almost double the audience it had last time I was on, more than a year ago. Joe is as excited about bitcoin as ever and we have a lot to discuss.\u201d\n\nJoe Rogan, who does commentary for the UFC, has had an illustrious career in entertainment. He hosted Fear Factor, once appearing alongside Dave Chappelle in the short-lived but groundbreaking Chappelle\u2019s Show. Rogan does standup, as well, oftentimes highlighting peculiar realities of modern society, ranging from topics like politics, marijuana, hallucinogens and maybe, one day, Bitcoin also.\u00a0\nThe episode will be a must-see, and can be heard live in many places on the Internet, including YouTube and Stitcher. Many people first heard about Bitcoin on Antonopoulos\u2019 previous appearances on the show.\nMuch Has Changed Since Last Appearance\nAntonopoulos first appeared on Rogan\u2019s podcast early 2014 in episode 446, then quickly thereafter he appeared in 490. Antonopoulos then appeared in Episode 581, which took place in December\u00a02014.\nBut much has changed since. For instance, 2015, which some dubbed the \u201cYear of the Blockchain,\u201d saw many of the world\u2019s biggest businesses enter into cryptocurrency space to experiment with the technology\u2019s potential use-cases.\nAntonopoulos has even offered to set Rogan up with a wallet and send some bitcoin. Rogan replied:\u00a0\u201cNot so sure about that, not so sure about that\u201d.\nOver the years, Rogan has seemingly become more intrigued by the digital currency.\nHe said in the most recent episode with Rogan: \u201cIn a sense what these banks can use bitcoin\u2026 It\u2019s almost like an ability to send and exchange money without using the money itself, they send [value] through bitcoin and money can be transferred to whatever their local currency is or not.\u201d\nWill you be watching Antonopoulos\u2019 next appearance on the JRE podcast?

{"url": "https://news.bitcoin.com/storj-counterparty-instant-micropayments/", "title": "Storj & Counterparty Testing Instant Micropayments Channel", "content": "\n\n\n\n\t            Storj & Counterparty Testing Instant Micropayments Channel            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounterparty and distributed storage platform Storj have teamed up to develop off-blockchain \u201cpayment channels\u201d similar to the much-anticipated Lightning Networks.\nAlso read: Stolen ShapeShift Funds on the Move, Passing Through Coinjoin Mixers\nStorj &\u00a0Counterparty Developing \u2018Picopayments\u2019\nPayment channel technology, which allows users to transact instantly and settle on the Bitcoin blockchain at a later stage, will also power upcoming Lightning Networks \u2013 designed to make micropayments fast, cheap and commonplace.\nThis proof-of-concept implementation of a payment channel is called \u201cPicopayments,\u201d and will allow users to transact in Storj\u2019s token SJCX, or other Counterparty-based assets, with other users.\nStorj CEO Shawn Wilkinson said:\n\nPayment channels allow for instant, \u2018streaming\u2019 payments of SJCX, which is a Counterparty token, in exchange for storage space on our network.\n\nStorj (Storj.io) is an encrypted, distributed storage platform where users can securely store files and even apps in the cloud, with no central servers to attack or censor.\nIt launched a public beta in April and is now part of Microsoft\u2019s Azure blockchain-as-a-service platform.\nInstant Trading with Multiple Assets\nThe Picopayments concept is a stepping stone towards Counterparty\u2019s long-time stated goal, which is to allow bidirectional micropayments for Counterparty assets \u2013 that is, sending one asset in return for bitcoin or other Counterparty assets.\nPreviously, all Counterparty network transactions were settled directly on the bitcoin blockchain, making them subject to the same 10-minute confirmation times.\nOther Counterparty-based projects are watching the development of this technology, with a view to implementing it themselves in future.\n\u201cMicropayments technology can be a huge benefit to us, allowing us to create new features not possible before,\u201d said Shaban Shaame, CEO of Everdreamsoft, makers of the popular Spells of Genesis game.\nUnidirectional vs. Bidirectional\nPayment channels allow users to \u201cstream\u201d payments to each other almost instantaneously, avoiding Bitcoin\u2019s 10-minute block confirmation times and transaction fees. At present, however, the technology allows only for \u201cunidirectional\u201d payments \u2013 user A can pay user B as normal, but user B cannot pay user A back through the same channel.\nRuben De Vries, Lead Developer Counterparty Core\nIt means, at this stage, one asset can be sent to another user but cannot be swapped for another different asset.\nLightning Networks, which are still under development, are intended to be bidirectional. the Counterparty/Storj system is unidirectional for now, pending further testing.\nStorj developer Fabian Barkhau and Counterparty lead developer Ruben de Vries began collaborating a month ago on code to merge into Counterparty\u2019s reference client counterparty-lib. The code will undergo testing on the Bitcoin testnet for a month and, if successful, will be enabled on the Bitcoin mainnet.\n\u201cWe appreciate the initiative Storj took here,\u201d said de Vries, adding:\n\nThis is a huge step forward that will truly allow for rapid, almost frictionless Counterparty token payments, as well as eventual use of Counterparty tokens on the Lightning Network.\n\nCounterparty has published a Payment Channels and Lightning Network FAQ page for developers and other curious parties to find out more.\nThe Challenge\u00a0with Micropayments\nBitcoin\u2019s blocks have often been full lately, due to the 1MB block size limit. Together with increases in price, this has seen miner fees escalate to $0.50 or more per transaction.\nThis diminishes Bitcoin\u2019s utility as a micropayments platform, despite the fact Bitcoin has historically been touted as an enabler of internet commerce at this level. Settling every single micropayment directly on the Bitcoin blockchain is taxing for the network and its resources, and some have discouraged Bitcoin being used for this purpose.\nOther solutions therefore need to be developed to fulfill the micropayments promise. Uses for micropayments include: paying journalists, artists and other creators for their content, tipping and upvoting, in-game tokens for games like SoG or SaruTobi, or even for performing internet searches.\nAre payment channels and Lightning Networks the answer to bitcoin\u2019s micropayments\u00a0and fast-transaction problem?\u00a0\n\nImages courtesy of Counterparty, Storj,\u00a0keyword-suggestions.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Share this story:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Tags in this story\n                \n\nCounterparty, lightning network, Ruben De Vries, Shawn Wilkinson, Storj \n\n\n\n                    Related\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCraig Wright Ordered to Produce a List of Early Bitcoin Addresses in Kleiman Lawsuit                    \n\n\n\t\t            NEWS | 23 hours ago \n\n\t\t\t\t\tOn April 28, the high profile Kleiman v.

Home Credit provides non-cash loans through in-store financing, mainly for purchases such as electronics and computers, musical instruments, home appliances or satellite TV subscriptions.\nLoan payments are just the latest addition to an impressive list of daily bills Philippines residents can pay using bitcoin, via their Coins.ph wallets.\nThe drop-down list on the wallet\u2019s \u201cPay Bills\u201d section lists over 70 bill payment options, including electric and water utilities, telecommunications and cable TV, insurance and broadband internet.\nThere are also options for national social security contributions, tuition fees at some schools, and credit card payments at almost 20 banks.\nUsers can also use the wallets to top up pre-paid mobile phone accounts and purchase game tokens\u00a0like\u00a0Steam Wallet credits, Money Online (MOL) Points and Garena Shells.\nCoins.ph wallets are accessible via web browsers or mobile apps for\u00a0Android and iOS.\nOverseas Sending Options\nCoins.ph also functions as a regular bitcoin exchange, and international remittance service with its \u201cCash Out\u201d feature. Amounts in Philippines pesos can be collected by the receiver in at least ten different ways. These include bank deposits, cardless ATM withdrawals, cash pickups and cash cards, and even door-to-door delivery.\nOf course, expat Filipinos sending money from abroad can also use their bitcoins to pay any of the bills listed above, instead of remitting money directly.\nBitcoin at Home\u00a0in the Philippines\nThe Philippines offers a huge potential market for bitcoin. It has a foreign diaspora of over 10 million which includes both temporary and permanent expat workers, and other foreign-born citizens of Filipino descent.\nThe country also has a large population of unbanked or under-banked people, meaning simple bank transfers are often not an option for remittances.\nIts economy grew by 6.9% in Q1 2016, as household\u00a0spending and investment also increased.\nOverseas Filipinos also sent $6.56 billion in cash remittances home in the same period. There has also been a sharp increase in smartphone shipments to the country, surpassing most others in the region.\nOther services including Satoshi Citadel Industries\u2019\u00a0Rebit.ph are trying to capture a share of the remittance market with services aimed directly at overseas transfers.\nDoes bitcoin have more potential for adoption in \u2019emerging economies\u2019 like the Philippines?

The trading platform has been suspended\u00a0since the second week of May, when a breach saw 250 BTC and 185,000 ETH removed from its wallets. At the time, the total value of the theft was $2 million, and represented 15% of the company\u2019s crypto asset deposits.\nCustomers can log into their accounts and those wishing to withdraw BTC amounts have been able to do so since May.\nIn another update, the company has fired its CTO and hired a replacement with an extensive background in systems security.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin.com, Gatecoin CEO\u00a0Aur\u00e9lien Menant provided some interesting details on the situation:\n\nFirstly, once it became clear that the system breach was in large part due to his negligence and failure to uphold his responsibilities as a CTO, there was no question about terminating his employment. Secondly, as a potential suspect in the breach, we could not risk keeping him on. The criminal investigation is still ongoing and hopefully we will have some further details to share in due time.\n\nNeither the replacement CTO nor the name of the Japanese investor has been revealed yet.\nCustomers to Be Made Whole\nIn a statement mailed to account holders, Gatecoin said it is \u201coptimistic about the prospect of attracting a network of co-investors to pledge additional amounts, which will only be used to reimburse clients\u2019 ETH.\u201d\nA cooperation with multi-crypto exchange Poloniex has already seen the recovery of 5,000 ETH. Although Poloniex had offered to help Gatecoin out for free, the company insisted on paying a promised 25% bounty to anyone with useful information \u2013 after customers have been made whole.\nThe $500K investment will be used to bolster the security infrastructure of the exchange and keep the company operating while management negotiates ways to replace missing funds. As well as a new CTO, Gatecoin will hire additional engineering talent with experience in secure financial systems.\nTransparency\nGatecoin has been transparent about the breach and its recovery process from the very beginning, providing detailed updates. Management\u00a0has stated repeatedly its intention to reimburse all customers.\n\u201cWe believe that transparent communications are essential to maintain good relationships with our clients and the community,\u201d Menant said, adding:\n\nWhen customers\u2019 funds are at stake, it\u2019s important that we provide as much information as possible to avoid speculation and concern. We will continue to update our clients at each stage of the recovery process.\n\nGatecoin\u2019s statement said management understands\u00a0frustrations among clients, who have been patient\u00a0until a time\u00a0can be announced\u00a0when ETH withdrawals are possible again.\nGatecoin continues to work with the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau of the Hong Kong Police Force to investigate the breach, which is likely to continue for several more months.\nOther Fundraising Options\nGatecoin is \u201cnegotiating with several clients on the terms and procedures of USD multi-million block trades,\u201d in order to secure enough ETH to reimburse its customers.\nIt had initially proposed a debenture, which \u201chad very little interest from potential investors.\u201d As a result, the company is also open to other proposals from the community as to other solutions.\nThe recovery effort may be made slightly easier by the recent slump in the price of ether. At the time of the hack, it was worth just over $10, similar to the price today ($10.22 at press time).\nIt had topped $20 just three weeks ago, right before an exploit in ethereum based project The DAO saw over 3,000,000 ETH taken and ethereum\u2019s price begin an extended decline.\nAre you a Gatecoin customer? In your opinion, is the company\u2019s response to the crisis setting a good example?\n\nImage credit: Barry Chum, via Wikimedia Commons,\u00a0enterpriseinnovation.net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Share this story:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Tags in this story\n                \n\nBitcoin hack, bitcoin theft, Crypto theft, ETH, Ethereum, Gatecoin, The DAO \n\n\n\n                    Related\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCraig Wright Ordered to Produce a List of Early Bitcoin Addresses in Kleiman Lawsuit                    \n\n\n\t\t            NEWS | 23 hours ago \n\n\t\t\t\t\tOn April 28, the high profile Kleiman v.

{"url": "https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereum-government-dao/", "title": "Ethereum Is Not a Government, It Is a DAO", "content": "\n\n\n\n\t            Ethereum Is Not a Government, It Is a DAO            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernance is the new buzz word of blockchain tech. And perhaps with good reason. But does this mean that blockchain systems are a new kind of Government?\nAlso read:\u00a0HashOcean: Another Cloud Mining Scam?\nIn a recent LetsTalkBitcoin podcast with Andreas Antonopoulos, Pamela Morgan discussed the facts and challenges posed by the legendary DAO hack with Ethereum insider Taylor Gerring and Attorney Brian Klein.\nAll was well and good on almost everything, and in my humble opinion they did an excellent job of exploring game theoretical costs and benefits or this path of action, or that one.\nShould Ethereum soft fork? Should it hard fork? Who is in the wrong and was it really a \u2018hack\u2019? Are the \u2018Terms of Agreement\u2019 paperwork legally binding? If you want to get caught up on the details and exciting, yet foggy swamps of Ethereum\u2019s current fork in the road, then this show will serve you well.\nHere\u2019s where they dropped the ball, though. It\u2019s a somewhat tangential issue, but it matters. At some point during the second half of the show, an audience member asked something along the lines of:\n\nIf the Ethereum community has the power to undo a certain transaction or block, and effectively bailout a failing venture on top of its platform. The what is the difference between Ethereum and a Government?\n\nThe well-educated folk on the show had nothing. Pamela quite literally said, \u201cI got nothing.\u201d\nI was stunned and quite frankly, facepalmed for a moment. Isn\u2019t the cryptocurrency space mostly libertarian? Has the word \u2018Governance\u2019 become so prominent in this space that we\u2019ve forgotten the difference between a highly competitive technological space and the monopolistic nature of government?\nI think the question posed by the audience member is very important, and I think the lack of an answer by the hosts shows how new the territory is that we are exploring.\nI\u2019ve personally struggled with this issue. Blockchains are such a mind blowing, world-view changing technology that everything you thought you knew about systems and power dynamics, about communication and money, gets shredded by Satoshi\u2019s brilliant imagination and reconstructed with subtle yet deeper resolution.\nCryptocurrencies are not Gov\u2019ts, They\u2019re\u00a0DAOs\nAlright, let\u2019s get to it. Here\u2019s an answer that was not given.\nNeither Ethereum, Bitcoin or any other decentralized cryptocurrency, or relatively small company or human organization or corporation are governments. Because none of these function like cartels.\nGovernments are, at the end of the day, a protection racket. Ethereum is not. Bitcoin is not.\nGovernments pretend to offer us services. Want some security? Call 911. Want education? We have\u00a0public schools! Feeling sick? Have some \u2018free\u2019 healthcare.\nOh yeah, you have to pay for all of it, whether you use it or not.\nBut what if you don\u2019t want any of their services?\nSecurity? No thanks, I\u2019ll arm myself, or hire a security company. Public schools? Yeah, I think I\u2019ll just home school. Free healthcare you say? A waiting list you say? I think I\u2019d rather just pay for it up front or get some sane insurance (oh wait, that\u2019s highly regulated and monopolized as well).\nAnd don\u2019t even dream of competing with them, because you know what is going to happen.\nThe same armed goons\u00a0that would be allegedly protecting you, will come in through the back door wearing an IRS badge, and say: \u201cHey, you owe us some \u2018taxes.\u2019 You are going to pay whether you like it or not.\u201d \nAnd if you resist, you are off to the cages or worst, under the dirt.\nThis happened to Peter Schiff\u2019s dad, a very educated tax activist. \nIt\u2019s a fact and we all know it.\nEthereum does not have an IRS. Bitcoin Does not have an IRS. If you don\u2019t like what a cryptocurrency (DAO for short) offers, you just sell. And no one\u2019s the wiser. No one will come after you, making you an offer that you can not refuse.\n\nThat\u2019s a true story.\nMore than that, cryptocoins (or rather DAOs) are completely opt-in. There\u2019s no way to argue today that Bitcoin or Ethereum, are governments because they are highly esoteric alternatives to the mainstream financial system. They are voluntary and not coerced.\nThey are one option in a spectrum of many possible financial technologies, alternative investments and decentralized databases. If Ethereum became as mainstream as the USD one day and started hiring thugs to force people to use it as \u2018legal tender\u2019 then it would be a government.\nWhat Is Governance?\nAll that said, I get the confusion. And I get it because of what many cryptocurrency enthusiasts have recognized since Bitcoin\u2019s epic blocksize debate. \u2018Governance,\u2019 this thing that seems to look and sound so much like \u2018Government\u2019 really, really matters.\nBut what is governance? Well, the easy answer this: governance is the study and modification of systems, in order to reach a desired power dynamic.\nIn financial systems like Bitcoin, the ideal power dynamic is one that achieves censorship resistance (at the very least). That is best served by some amount decentralization. It is a balance between miners and mining pools. Between the needs and expectations of users, service providers, developers and the profitability of securing the blockchain.\nThe name of the game in this example is keeping mining pools with less than half of the mining power, etc.\nThis is why I say that Bitcoin, Ethereum and every other altcoin and 2.0 platform out there are DAOs. They are literally Decentralized Autonomous Organizations.\nEthereum is just one big DAO with smaller DAOs on top of it.\nSo is forking Ethereum a Bailout?\nVitalik Buterin\nWell, this question is tricky.\nNo matter what action the Ethereum community takes, even with consensus, the damage has been done by the DAO hack.\nIf Ethereum does nothing and lets the hacker take the money, then it will turn into an ugly mess of DAO wars, trying to hack each other like we saw the past few days. Until all the 140 million are completely drained. A nasty sight that would be.\nIf Ethereum keeps the soft fork and simply freezes the money forever, not letting the \u2018hacker\u2019 nor the investors have an incentive to make poor decisions, then that\u2019s a $140 million lesson.\nIf the Ethereum soft fork works the \u2018hacker\u2019 in the rear and returns the money to investors, by undoing a transaction in ETH\u2019s history, then its claim to immutability will be compromised. \nThis would also prove that under the right circumstances, Ethereum as a community might be willing to change history, and that could attract the wrong kind of powerful attention.\nNo matter what, Ethereum will pay some cost for this, as an asset and as a community. The question is how to pay it and what is less costly.\nIf Ethereum were the size of Bitcoin right now, I\u2019d opine that there should be no intervention. It\u2019s simply against the stated values of the Eth DAO.\nBut Ethereum is ten months old. It has not even matured into Proof of Stake, and having 5 to 14 percent of the total ETH controlled by an explicitly malicious party, could indeed spell doom for Ethereum\u2019s security or at least credibility. At the very least, it is a terrible way to begin a transition to proof of stake.\nSo Ethereum is still beta, it is still young and this is the only reason I can think of to soft fork and even hard fork that \u2018hack\u2019 out of history.\nThe lesson about how secure smart contracts need to be has been learned either way.\nDo you think Ethereum should be forked?

In response, companies are giving them more options to do so, including over-the-counter (OTC) trading.\nAlso read: OTC Trading: An Inside Look at How Whales Move Bitcoin\nThanks to increasing regulation and formal procedures required to set up an online exchange account, there has been a rise in OTC trading for regular people as well as large investors.\nServices like LocalBitcoins and Mycelium\u2018s Local Trader have grown in popularity over the years, and now others are joining the competition.\nChina\u2019s Answer\nIn countries like China, these services also help to overcome restrictions on how money can be transferred digitally\u00a0or moved in and out of exchanges.\nOne such facilitator\u00a0is China\u2019s BitKan\u00a0(formerly BTCKan), which added\u00a0OTC trading to its three-year-old mobile app at the end of May. Designed initially for the Chinese market, the app also has an English version available for iOS and Android on international stores.\nIn a month the app has now processed over 1,000 BTC in trades. That may seem small compared to investor-class OTC market, but it shows the beginnings of a burgeoning \u201cstreet market\u201d for bitcoins happening away from exchanges.\nOTC Trading screenshots courtesy BitKan.com\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s not to say BitKan is a gray market for bitcoins \u2013 if you want to trade more than 3 BTC per transaction, you\u2019ll need to provide ID and register it in the company\u2019s database to comply with international anti-money-laundering requirements.\nSmall amounts, though, can be traded\u00a0by anyone and that could be the cutting edge of bitcoin adoption.\nBitcoin Trading Goes P2P with OTC\nBitKan calls its app \u201cThe DIDI of bitcoin\u201d \u2013 DIDI is China\u2019s answer to Uber \u2013 making the comparison to ride-share services that spearheaded the push for mobile technology to create P2P marketplaces in almost every area of commerce.\nOperations manager Dan Li told Bitcoin.com most OTC trading is not face-to-face but online, thanks to China\u2019s easy payment networks on platforms like AliPay and WeChat.\n\nOn the BitKan platform, users don\u2019t have to look for local traders. Because online payment is still our primary method of payment right now. In China, online payment is very mature, so there are few needs of offline trading. Of course, in coming months, we will also support face-to-face transactions. Then, users will be able to find local traders base on location.\n\nThe app processes the bitcoin payment, but users arrange the fiat transfer themselves on the integrated messaging system.\nAt present, the app gives prices in CNY and USD, but there are plans to incorporate other local fiat currencies in future.\nLike other OTC trading apps, BitKan needs to increase its user base to benefit from a network effect. The app\u2019s directory lists only a handful of traders at the moment, though that is bound to increase as the service becomes more widely-known.\nAs well as up-to-date prices and OTC trading, BitKan\u2019s app also includes live news, prices for litecoin and other altcoins, and mining statistics. Users can set alerts when prices on their preferred exchange rises above or falls below set levels.\n\u201cWe hope that BitKan can help our global users to discover, possess, save and use bitcoin more conveniently,\u201d Li said.\nNew Crackdown on Online Payments Could Benefit Bitcoin\nThere are, however, current concerns that Chinese customers\u2019 access to fast and easy online payments could be under threat, with the introduction of new regulations drafted last year.\n\nMedium-to-large payments (above \uffe55000, or $750) must now go through bank accounts. Non-verified users can only transfer \uffe51000 ($150) maximum per transaction. Not only that\u00a0but Bank UKey or Bank Apps must be used for any online payment above \uffe5200 ($30).\nTwitter\u2019s @cnLedger later explained the policy move on Reddit, saying it was probably an attempt by banks to discourage people from using alternate payment systems.\nThat could indirectly, however, end up benefiting bitcoin.\n\nIt is clear that with this policy in effect, banks want to force people go back and use their already heavily criticized systems. But history never goes backwards. Without Alipay/Wechat-pay, Bitcoin is one of the only few promising choices left to the public. That\u2019s why I tweeted it.\n\nWith further restrictions on using regulated channels to make CNY payments, a platform like BitKan\u2019s will have even greater utility for moving users in and out of the bitcoin ecosystem.\nAnd once in, they may decide it\u2019s more convenient to stay in.\nWould you like to try BitKan\u2019s OTC trading app? Do you think apps like these are effective at introducing more newcomers to bitcoin?\n\nImages via John Southurst, BitKan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Share this story:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Tags in this story\n                \n\nAsia, Bitcoin OTC, BitKan, China, LocalBitcoins, Mycelium \n\n\n\n                    Related\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCraig Wright Ordered to Produce a List of Early Bitcoin Addresses in Kleiman Lawsuit                    \n\n\n\t\t            NEWS | 23 hours ago \n\n\t\t\t\t\tOn April 28, the high profile Kleiman v.

{"url": "https://news.bitcoin.com/otc-trading-whales-bitcoin/", "title": "OTC Trading: An Inside Look at How Whales Move Bitcoin", "content": "\n\n\n\n\t            OTC Trading: An Inside Look at How Whales Move Bitcoin            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent conversation shone a new light on over-the-counter, or OTC, bitcoin trading \u2014 suggesting much of the large-scale movements between fiat and cryptocurrencies happens away from the exchange books.\nAlso read: 4 Reasons Why Bitcoin is Outperforming Everything\nEntrepreneur and well-known bitcoin investor Vinny Lingham\u00a0\u2014 co-founder and CEO of Civic Technologies, and former CEO of Gyft \u2014 highlighted the issue with a blog post on June 27 titled, \u201cThe 1% Don\u2019t Use Bitcoin Exchanges.\u201d\nLingham confirmed what anyone who has spent years watching bitcoin already knows: that there are very wealthy people out there investing in bitcoin, and they\u2019re keeping it low-key. Serious money is moving into cryptocurrency.\n\nHis main point, however, was that the regular (ie: on-exchange) bitcoin market is simply not large or liquid enough yet to process large trades. To place a seven-figure dollar trade would shift the price in a direction unfavorable to the trader before the trade is completed, a phenomenon known as slippage.\nIn fact, \u201cregular eight-figure trades are now common\u201d on the OTC market, he wrote. 66 percent of the OTC trade this year has been buyers, and more entered the market after last week\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d decision without having a huge impact on the bitcoin price.\nLingham, who says he\u2019s been \u201cpretty on-the-money\u201d with past bitcoin price predictions, is extremely bullish about the near future,\u00a0tweeting:\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s straight to $1151 now\u2026 very little pausing.\u201d\nHe clarified\u00a0the prediction was predicated on the price breaking above $726 \u2013 which he realized happened due to the OTC market masking real volume. $1151 will still happen, but not until after sustained breaks above $726 and then $830.\nOTC for Whales, Exchanges for Everyone Else\nSo who is using bitcoin exchanges? Are they only for high-volume algorithm trading, day-traders and amateurs?\nLingham told us that it\u2019s probably all of the above, but essentially just regular people \u2014 the 99 percent \u2014 or people who want easy exchange but don\u2019t need to execute major positions. OTC dealers do use exchanges too, as market-makers.\nWhen will liquidity in the bitcoin marketplace reach levels where large-scale orders can be executed? Lingham said:\n\nPredictions are largely guessing for bitcoin, albeit educated sometimes. I would rather say that the conditions for this to exist appears to be in the $3-$5k/BTC range from my best guess.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely a price issue, he noted, and not an attempt to avoid regulation. Most well-known OTC dealers still have KYC/AML requirements.\n\nThis is largely a market and liquidity issue but high net worth US and UK individuals and family offices would also not setup accounts at large unregulated exchanges, regardless of liquidity. They would rather use a trusted broker or intermediary to execute the trades. MTGox is not yet a distant memory.\n\nWho are the Dealers?\nLingham referenced Harry Yeh\u2019s Binary Financial in his piece. Another large player is New York-based exchange\u00a0itBit, which launched its OTC trading service in July 2015.\nItBit publishes monthly statistics and reports on its OTC activity. In May 2016, it saw 19,710 BTC and $8.7m traded, with an average of 635 BTC per day.\nMay was actually a low month for itBit OTC. The peaks were in February and April 2016, especially February, which recorded 66,230 BTC and $26.4m traded, average 3,153 BTC per day.\nWhile bitcoin prices have been rising since the beginning of 2016, this bullish behavior probably wasn\u2019t reflected in the on-exchange bitcoin price until May, when it began to soar once again.\nAlso of note is that 75 percent of itBit\u2019s May OTC traders were institutional investors. The US, Canada, UK and Australia were the largest traders, but there was also a surprising amount of OTC activity from India, Japan and the Southeast Asian region.\nChart source: itBit\nAlways Remember China\nOne should never underestimate China\u2019s influence in the world bitcoin market.\nThough it has kept a low-profile and is yet largely unknown globally, Richfund.pe claims to be China\u2019s (or even the world\u2019s) largest bitcoin hedge fund and liquidity provider. It also functions as a market-maker for exchanges and engages in large-scale OTC trading.\nRichfund\u2019s overseas marketing manager Kong Gao also spoke to Bitcoin.com about his company\u2019s experiences, which have been going on at scale for some time and probably impacted the regular price:\n\nWe had a customer back in 2013 who bought 100,000,000 CNY ($15.1m) worth of bitcoins from us in 15 tranches over a one-month period. This trade raised the bitcoin price from 3,500 CNY to 5,000 CNY ($527-$753). He bought about 25,000 bitcoins in total and stored them in five different addresses. There are many trades between 500 BTC to 700 BTC. In addition to direct OTC service, we also help other OTC traders hedge their bitcoin position and these ranges from 5,000 to 2,000 bitcoins. And recently we had a trade of 140,000 euro.\n\nEven though the 2013 trade shifted the price, at that time trading such an amount on public exchanges would have caused slippage too great to make it worthwhile.\nRichfund charges a 2 percent commission on USD trades via international bank wire (usually using Bitfinex prices as a guide) though it\u2019s higher for GBP and EUR. Exact rates may be negotiable based on the amounts required and how regularly a customer trades.\n\nAdditionally, we have a wide network of traders working with us in Europe and Mexico who can trade cash for bitcoin for us. Of course for cash trading, our rate is higher. Yes, we do negotiate different rate for everyone. There are many factors to take into account and these factors revolve around the status of our existing network of traders and cash holdings. Of course, to stay competitive, we offer the best rate possible for every trader trading with us.\n\nBitcoin Iceberg Signals a Bright Future\nKong said Richfund\u2019s OTC mission is to provide liquidity to traders to scale up their trading volume, thus making greater profits. It probably also means greater returns for all bitcoin holders in the longer term.\nThe lessons to be learned here are: there is always far more to bitcoin than meets the eye, the world\u2019s \u201c1 p\u201d of high net-worth individuals have definitely noticed and have been buying up for years, and bitcoin is a far more serious business than the mainstream media reports.\nRegular exchange traders may feel at the mercy of these large movers and shakers, but ultimately they signal a confidence in bitcoin beyond what is readily visible \u2013 which bodes well for the future.\nDoes all this behind-the-scenes activity give you more confidence in bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general? Would you like to dabble in some off-exchange trading yourself?\n\nFeatured image via\u00a0Wikimedia Commons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Share this story:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Tags in this story\n                \n\nBitcoin OTC, Bitcoin Whales, ItBit, Richfund, Vinny Lingham \n\n\n\n                    Related\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCraig Wright Ordered to Produce a List of Early Bitcoin Addresses in Kleiman Lawsuit                    \n\n\n\t\t            NEWS | 23 hours ago \n\n\t\t\t\t\tOn April 28, the high profile Kleiman v.

Nothing herein is intended to be understood as legal advice. Consult a lawyer qualified to provide legal advice in your jurisdiction.\nAre smart contract implementations requiring zero human intervention reliable? A thousand years of legal history and the DAO suggest something more than zero is required.\nAlso read: New FCC Rules Could Block Your E-Wallet\nContract Reformation\nThe DAO (Distributed Autonomous Organization) resembles a smart contract. It deploys source code on a blockchain distributing virtual currency to parties according to rules set by the code. The DAO\u2019s purpose is to act as an investment vehicle, investing in and voting on ventures according to the collective will of its investors. One DAO member discovered that the code allowed him to create a sub-contract that bypassed the normal rules governing balance of funds. He created a sub-contract allowing him to take for himself ~$50M USD worth of the DAO\u2019s virtual currency. He wrote the DAO a letter justifying his actions on the sole basis that the source code permitted it. Large DAO stakeholders proposed hard-forking the DAO\u2019s code recoup the ~$50M.\nThe DAO hard-fork dilemma ushers contract reformation into the blockchain era. Is a hard-fork justified? Is the DAO a contract? Was this preventable? Does it hold implications for Bitcoin? Understanding how the legal doctrines of law and equity developed can help with answers.\nLaw & Equity\nIt may be said that law is the application of the law according to its letter (code), and equity is application of the law according to its spirit (hard-fork). In a broad sense, equity is the body of principles, which provide and govern exceptions to the law. The function of equity is the correction of the law where the law fails by reason of its universality (e.g. law\u2019s tendency to establish rules without exceptions). Since it is theoretically impossible to create a code with a perfect set of exceptions, equity exists to ensure fair results.\nIn medieval England, law courts lacking equity jurisdiction were used to resolve disputes. When the law courts reached decisions contrary to the law\u2019s intent, English subjects of wealth and influence could seek relief by petitioning the King, who as sovereign possessed the highest power under England\u2019s law. The King granted relief from the law courts frequently enough to justify establishing a Court of Chancery to render decisions on his behalf. The Court of Chancery developed rules and remedies from its cases that became the common law of equity.\nAmerica adopted England\u2019s common law legal system, but many legal scholars at the time were skeptical of equity courts. Having just fought a revolution to escape the control of a distant sovereign, skepticism of an institution representing the King\u2019s sovereignty above the law was natural. Courts of law and equity were thus merged. Today, both in state-run courts and private arbitration a single judge administers remedies in equity and law.\nThe hard-fork now proposed by the DAO\u2019s most wealthy and influential members is similar to the position of wealthy medieval English subjects prior to the creation of the Court of Chancery. The hard-fork proposal, like special appeals to a King by his friends, risks being applied to benefit special interests. Such a system is inferior to one designed to be applied according to principle. But establishing a system of equity poses identity issues for the DAO.\nLibertarians &\u00a0Technologists\nThe founders of the DAO, not unlike early American legal scholars, perhaps saw equity as representing the arbitrary interference of a sovereign. This view is misguided. Where Bitcoin is libertarian in its ideals, the DAO/Ethereum is technologist. Bitcoin provides an alternative to government-issued currency, the DAO/Ethereum provides an alternative for enforcing agreements. During the past 100 years, the state has treated currency and dispute resolution differently, aggressively asserting a monopoly over issuing currency while consistently upholding agreements to arbitrate disputes privately. The DAO/Ethereum thus appear technologist compared to Bitcoin, which has more libertarian leanings.\nEquity would destroy the DAO\u2019s technological purity. The nature of equity means there is no precise way to control an arbitrator\u2019s discretion when applying equitable remedies. Rogue human elements can presently only be mitigated through traditional systems of checks and balances (e.g. requiring consensus from a panel, electing and impeaching arbitrators, etc.) Perhaps we have to accept that justice is an art, not a science.\nThe DAO\u2019s crisis poses questions for technologists, but not libertarians. Bitcoin still not affected.\nApplying Equity to the DAO\nOn the surface, the DAO presents an appropriate situation for an equitable remedy. But analyzing the intentions of the DAO\u2019s creators reveals equity may not be appropriate.\nEquity requires that parties negotiate agreements in good faith, and it imposes fiduciary duties on partners requiring them to act honestly toward each other. The DAO\u2019s \u201cAttacker\u201d appears not to have acted in good faith. The purpose of the DAO was to be an investment vehicle with investors sharing profits from their investments. The Attacker added zero value while taking roughly a third of the DAO\u2019s total investment for himself.\nIf the DAO is akin to a partnership, the Attacker acting in his own self-interest at the expense of his DAO partners breaches the fiduciary duty he owed to the DAO. The Attacker even penned a letter to the public, brazenly admitting his bad faith intent to profit at the DAO\u2019s expense. Contract reformation has been justified on less.\nThe Attacker maintains in his letter his actions were justified. His argument, essentially, is that the \u201cThe DAO Creation\u201d, as its terms call it, was not a partnership or a contract: it was source code and nothing more. The Attacker reasons his actions are thus justified because the source code accepted his input. If we take his reasoning one step further, the DAO\u2019s creators are the ones acting in financial self-interest, breaking their own rules to propose a hard fork after they lost money. Since equity requires \u201cclean hands\u201d (meaning the party seeking equity must have done no wrong) even if the Attacker\u2019s act was in bad faith and intended to harm the DAO, a prudent judge exercising discretion may decide the DAO\u2019s creators are not entitled to it.\nTrying to pick sides begs a series of increasingly complex questions.\nIs the \u201cDAO Creation\u201d a contract or something new? Can one draft a contract term agreeing to exclude equitable remedies? If the DAO is something new, is it possible for a blockchain to exist outside the natural law?\nRegardless of the DAO\u2019s fate, these questions will persist for Ethereum and require further introspection. Though the DAO may be having an existential crisis, smart contract implementations seeking a to compete in today\u2019s private arbitration market need not have one if they leave room in their system for equity.\nHow would you answer these questions?

Given the varying methodologies employed by different companies to record this information, and the fact that trades represent past prices and not available offers, it may not always offer the most accurate price of bitcoin.\nTo solve this problem, we examine each exchange\u2019s actual order books, to assess liquidity for extra price accuracy. We define \u201cavailable liquidity\u201d as the amount of bitcoin a user could trade (in theory) without shifting the price more than 1% up or down.\nThis information is then combined to publish Kaiko\u2019s Bitcoin Price Indices for a more reflective global price and local currency indicators. \nHow the Exchanges Rank, and Why\nParticularly noteworthy, Kaiko has found, is the placement of large Chinese exchanges on our BTC-USD pair rankings. These exchanges typically place highly in terms of total trade volumes, but available liquidity is lower \u2013 suggesting algorithmic trading, but in smaller amounts per trade.\n\nThe top three exchange positions over the past six months \u2013 based purely on BTC-USD trading volumes \u2013 are \u00a0Huobi, Bitfinex and OKCoin.\nWhen liquidity is taken into account, however, the top three are Bitfinex, itBit and Bitstamp. To calculate a final ranking index, Kaiko considers both volumes and liquidity, giving 70% weighting to liquidity and 30% to volumes.\nBitfinex moved up from the #4 position in December 2015 to consistently rank #1 on Kaiko\u2019s weighted index \u2013 followed by itBit and Huobi, which have placed between #2 and #4 over the same period.\n\nHigh-volume bitcoin traders, it appears, still prefer the less-regulated markets in Europe and Asia.\n\nOKCoin\u2018s USD ranking slipped from the top spot last December to its current fifth place.\nOther exchanges listed on Kaiko\u2019s index are BTC-e, Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken. Though the Winklevoss-owned Gemini has moved ahead of Coinbase since the beginning of May, US-based BTC-USD exchanges hold the three lowest places of the nine Kaiko has ranked. High-volume bitcoin traders, it appears, still prefer the less-regulated markets in Europe and Asia.\nMore Reports to Follow\nKaiko\u2019s exchange report is the first in a series the company is producing to give an accurate, statistics-based overview of the digital currency industry. Over the coming months, more reports will be published to examine other sectors of the bitcoin industry, such as mining.\nThe initial report, focusing on the exchange industry, will be available for purchase on the Bitcoin.com Store and on Airex Market from June 15th, covering the period December 1st 2015 to May 31st, 2016.\nThe report looks at the currency pairs of most interest to the digital currency industry at the time of publication: BTC-USD, BTC-EUR, BTC-CNY, ETH-BTC, and ETH-USD.\nAll underlying data from the report is also available for purchase, should anyone in the industry wish to re-crunch parts of it. \nAbout Kaiko\nPascal Gauthier\nKaiko launched in 2015, with a stated goal to become the Ultimate Data Source for Bitcoin. Its mission is to organize Bitcoin\u2019s information to help businesses succeed by providing data, insights and services.\nOver the past year we\u2019ve been happy to cooperate with premier sites like Bitcoin.com and BitMEX to supply price and other network data charts, with the aim of helping bitcoin and digital currency users make better decisions.\nThe company now has eight staff and is looking to hire more talented data professionals and developers at its headquarters in Paris.\nAuthor:\u00a0Pascal Gauthier\nWhat do you think about these recent market figures?

A court case in Florida may be about to give us an answer.\nAlso read:\u00a0Liberty Reserve Creator Sentenced to 20 Years Jail Time\nCan\u2019t Launder Money If It\u2019s Not Money\nMichel Espinoza\nThe by-now infamous case concerns Michel Espinoza, a young computer programmer and early bitcoin trader arrested in January 2014, and later charged with dealing in currency without a money transmitter license and attempted money-laundering.\nEspinoza\u2019s legal team has filed a motion to dismiss the case with the argument that bitcoin is not defined as currency under Florida law, so the charges cannot apply.\nBarry University economics professor Charles Evans testified for the defence, saying legal definitions of Bitcoin were messy and varied in different jurisdictions, and that the IRS defines Bitcoin as similar to barter.\nAccording to a newspaper report, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Mary Pooler called the case \u201cthe most fascinating thing I\u2019ve heard in this courtroom in a long time.\u201d\nPooler is due to make a decision by June 17th after hearing further arguments\u00a0and is believed to be working on a detailed written judgment to present after that date.\nLegal Team Confident\nMichel Espinoza, who was an active trader on LocalBitcoins.com in Miami, was arrested in February 2014 after a lengthy undercover sting operation.\nInvestigators had been shadowing the local Bitcoin community in Miami since they attended the North American Bitcoin Conference there in early 2013, in what Esponiza\u2019s attorney Rene Palomino called a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d for a local trader to use as a test case.\nSpeaking to Bitcoin.com, Palomino said he was optimistic Judge Pooler would make a logical decision on the case, adding that she had done background research, asked interesting questions and understood the economic principles surrounding the case. He explained:\n\u201cBased on the evidence and videos I\u2019ve viewed, this young man did absolutely nothing wrong.\u201d\nEspinoza wasn\u2019t trying to set up a bitcoin exchange or bank, and engaged in simple one-to-one transactions without a third party, Palomino said. He had no prior criminal history.\nBesides, there is no current law or case history available for people to understand how to act where bitcoin trading is involved.\n\u201cBitcoin does not fall under any of the terms used to define financial transactions\u201d under current law, he said, describing the\u00a0attempted money-laundering charge in particular as \u201cvery weak.\u201d\n\u2018Guinea Pig\u2019 Test Case\nEspinoza made three transactions of $500 USD to undercover detectives posing as fellow Bitcoin enthusiasts. At a later date, he met the same individuals at a hotel room where they requested a further $30,000 trade and discussed a foreigner they knew who dealt in stolen credit card numbers.\nHe did not feel comfortable making the transaction in a hotel room and requested it take place in a bank, at which point he was arrested. Police initially attempted to charge Espinoza with money laundering\u00a0but reduced it to attempted money laundering since the transaction never actually took place.\nThe detectives targeted Espinoza and a second trader, Pascal Reid, at an early stage in Bitcoin\u2019s history \u2013 when most government agencies were only just starting to discover cryptocurrency and its uses \u2013 in what Espinoza\u2019s legal team calls a \u201cguinea pig case.\u201d\nReid later pled guilty to the unlicensed money transmission charge and received probation. Money-laundering charges against Reid were dismissed.\nBitcoin & Money-Laundering\nEspinoza may have been one of the first people charged with a money laundering offense for trading bitcoins, but he wasn\u2019t always the most famous. In December 2014, the former CEO of pioneer bitcoin exchange BitInstant, Charlie Shrem, was sentenced to two years\u2019 prison for a similar crime.\nIn Shrem\u2019s case, he worked in partnership with Robert Faiella to trade large volumes of dollars for bitcoins, which were later used to buy drugs on the defunct online marketplace Silk Road.\nHe was arrested very publicly at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy airport upon returning home from a Bitcoin conference in Amsterdam, a move which led some Bitcoiners to accuse the NY authorities of organizing a publicity stunt.\nMeanwhile, in Florida\nSome have ridiculed the charges against Espinoza for concerning such small amounts of money. More high-stakes money-laundering usually involves multi-million dollar sums over longer periods of time.\nFor an ironic sense of proportion, Florida\u2019s own Bal Harbour police department and Glades County Sheriff\u2019s Office have been under investigation for laundering over $70 million for South American drug cartels, in an operation that appears to have little relevance to their local law enforcement work.\nThat supposed sting operation included a staggering 84 deals with criminal gangs in Chicago alone, and multiple luxury purchases, hotels and flights for the officers involved. The police did not make any arrests in the course of their \u201cinvestigations.\u201d\nDo you think this case could determine Bitcoin\u2019s legal status moving forward?

Despite not being intended for use as a spending currency, ether has been gaining attention recently as a potential competitor to bitcoin.\nEther\u2019s value has gone from a low of around $0.42 USD in October 2015 to highs above $14 USD in March and May this year, making it the darling of speculators and gaining plenty of media attention.\nApple Likes Ethereum After All?\nThe release comes amid claims Apple may have a policy to reject apps using Ethereum\u2019s native token ether from the iOS App Store.\nThat appears not to be the case, though it remains possible Apple is reviewing each app submission individually, and judging some to be more approval-worthy\u00a0than others.\nCEO and Co-founder Anthony Di Iorio told Bitcoin.com the Toronto-based team had seen the previous reports decided to get the app onto the iOS store and put it into users\u2019 hands as soon as possible, given there were no other options for the platform until now.\nThe team decided to launch with a basic wallet similar to those already available on other platforms, and add more advanced features in the near future.\nKryptoKit, which also makes the instant browser-based\u00a0bitcoin wallet creator RushWallet, has spent the past few days dealing with a DDoS attack which temporarily took down both the Jaxx.io and Rushwallet.com sites.\nThough the attackers demanded ransom money, they did not steal any funds from either KryptoKit or its users.\nDAO Integration Coming Soon\nAlthough the iOS version has the same functionality as the beta versions on other platforms, the Jaxx team said in an online post that \u201cfull featured DAO integration,\u201d including the ability to vote on proposals, would be ready within the first week.\nThe Jaxx wallet derives both its bitcoin and ether private keys from the same mnemonic seed, simplifying the user experience. The wallet is also HD, generating new keys for every transaction to maximize privacy.\nUsers can set PIN codes for security, but there are no login accounts or passwords (other than the original seed). Jaxx seeks to be a user-friendly \u201cwallet experience only,\u201d and\u00a0does not keep the digital tokens, private keys or personal data on any users. This keeps the company free of any regulatory issues.\nThe Jaxx\u00a0back-end code is viewable (and auditable) via a link on the site.\nThe 1.0 version of Jaxx on iOS is the first available to consumers, although select testers have been using the beta version for some time. It is also available on Android, Windows, OS X, Linux, and as browser extensions for Firefox and Chrome.\nDoes a wallet experience similar to that of Bitcoin make you more likely to try Ethereum? What other features do you think an Ethereum wallet should have?\n\nImages courtesy of Apple, Jaxx.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Share this story:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Tags in this story\n                \n\nAnthony Di Iorio, Bitcoin Wallet, ether, Jaxx, Kryptokit \n\n\n\n                    Related\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCraig Wright Ordered to Produce a List of Early Bitcoin Addresses in Kleiman Lawsuit                    \n\n\n\t\t            NEWS | 23 hours ago \n\n\t\t\t\t\tOn April 28, the high profile Kleiman v.

{"url": "https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-prime-minister-dao-challenge-law/", "title": "Russian Prime Minister: DAO's an 'Interesting Challenge' for Lawmakers", "content": "\n\n\n\n\t            Russian Prime Minister: DAO's an 'Interesting Challenge' for Lawmakers            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt\u00a0the International Legal\u00a0Forum, which took its place May\u00a018-21, in St. Petersburg, Russia, Russian prime minister Dmitriy Medvedev gave a short speech to legal experts on\u00a0the Internet of Things, blockchain technology, and DAOs. Although his rhetoric was calm, soft and simple, many Russian cryptocurrency users saw\u00a0his statements as an omen\u00a0of a future clampdown.\nAlso read: India\u2019s \u2018Unregulated\u2019 Bitcoin Industry is Thriving\nRussia\u2019s Prime Minister on New Legal Challenges\nMedvedev\u00a0began by noting the\u00a0fast development of a strange and unknown \u201dnew part of the virtual space,\u201d saying:\n\n\n[\u2026] I would like to focus on\u00a0the\u00a0new part of the virtual space which we\u2019ll\u00a0need to study in detail. I\u2019m talking about e-commerce and electronic transactions. They\u2019re developing so fast that the law isn\u2019t capable of reacting in real time.\n\n\n\nHe\u00a0continued by\u00a0specifying what exactly the legal experts need to focus on:\n\n\nThere are plenty of examples: today, the so-called \u2018blockchain technology\u2019\u00a0is evolving, the so-called \u2018smart contracts technology\u2019\u00a0is\u00a0too. In fact, with their help,\u00a0new so-called \u2018autonomous non-government self-regulating systems\u2019 are emerging. No doubt, they are an exceptionally interesting challenge\u00a0for legal\u00a0specialists. Very often, the boundaries of law end here.\n\n\nInterestingly, Medvedev points out that autonomous, self-regulating systems\u00a0lack written laws. It seems the\u00a0Russian prime minister hasn\u2019t considered\u00a0that decentralized, autonomous, i.e. self-regulating systems, don\u2019t need additional regulation by design, especially from central\u00a0governments.\n\nInstead\u00a0Medvedev\u00a0told\u00a0the audience that \u201cif it\u2019s not regulated by the Russian government, it\u2019s not regulated at all,\u201d insinuating\u00a0that\u00a0Russia\u2019s political system would\u00a0address\u00a0citizen\u2019s interests and protect users better than an\u00a0Internet-based consensus system.\nThe prime minister then touched upon the topic of\u00a0IoT, saying: \n\n\nSelling and buying the property, establishing\u00a0property rights, are all being performed autonomously. The interaction over the network is\u00a0between electronic devices, not people. Such devices are exchanging data with each other on behalf of\u00a0their owners. The so-called \u2018Internet of Things\u2019\u00a0is spreading all over the world.\n\n\nMedvedev finished his speech by pointing that legal specialists\u00a0are allowed to start using\u00a0their \u201dcreative powers\u201d and begin to\u00a0prepare\u00a0practical solutions for overseeing online users\u2019 participation in\u00a0DAOs and\u00a0blockchain-related businesses.\nMedvedev:\n\n\nLet me repeat, this situation requires you to group\u00a0your creative powers, which\u00a0is not a standard task for a legal experts. This is a task of searching for new, effective solutions, which may become the\u00a0basis for creating a brand new legal sphere.\u00a0I hope this topic will provoke new discussions within the ongoing event, and maybe we\u00a0will even get\u00a0some new proposals and solutions. As for the efficacy\u00a0of these solutions, I hope to\u00a0discuss these at\u00a0future forums.\n\n\nRussian Bitcoin Users React\nRussia\u2019s Bitcoin community, however, didn\u2019t\u00a0see the prime minister\u2019s speech\u00a0as a\u00a0welcome sign. One of Russian Bitcoin news outlets, bitnovosti.com, posted this video on their YouTube channel.\u00a0Here\u2019s the translation of some Russian commentators\u2019 opinions.\n\nUser Ivan Lebedev: \u201cI\u2019m listening to him and hear the undertone: fence it, restrict it, take under control! No way!\u201d\nUser mate: \u201cThey will try to restrict and \u2018fence us,\u2019 as always.\u201d\nUser \u0414\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043d \u0414\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043a: \u201cUh Oh, he offers jurists to solve the blockchain problem \u2014 a colossal work. You need to be a genius to implement a third party fee to an automated system. They probably won\u2019t be able to deploy effective\u00a0tax collection\u00a0using\u00a0an ordinary license. It\u2019s time for them to invent something new, and I wish they would not do it in such haste.\u201d \nUser \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u0424\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432: \u2018\u201dThey will fuck up the blockchain and Google soon, so you guys will get the North Korea here\u2026 Where they brainwash local people that Americans are so poor that they melting the ice to get drink in winter and have nowhere to sleep when it\u2019s cold.\u201d\nThe full video of\u00a0Dmitriy Medvedev\u2019s talk:\n\n\nWhat do you think about Russian government\u2019s intent to control blockchain based entities?

{"url": "https://news.bitcoin.com/hacker-johoe-develop-new-trezor/", "title": "Good Samaritan Hacker 'Johoe' to Develop New Trezor for SatoshiLabs", "content": "\n\n\n\n\t            Good Samaritan Hacker 'Johoe' to Develop New Trezor for SatoshiLabs            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSatoshiLabs has hired cryptography researcher and Bitcoin \u2018white hat\u2019 hacker Jochen Hoenicke, to help the company work on the next generation of its flagship TREZOR hardware wallet devices.\nAlso read: IDC Report Says Blockchain Could Improve Gov\u2019t Functions\n\u2018Bitcoin Hero\u2019 Johoe\nHoenicke, aka \u201cJohoe,\u201d earned the respect of the Bitcoin community in 2014-15 when he exploited a security flaw in Blockchain\u2019s key-generation algorithm to sweep over 800 BTC from users\u2019 wallets. Other non-Blockchain addresses were also affected by the issue.\nHe then returned the coins to Blockchain, using a Trezor device to do so. Johoe\u2019s actions earned plenty of praise from the Bitcoin community, leading to him being called a \u201cgood samaritan\u201d and \u201cBitcoin Hero.\u201d\nMostly there was a sense of relief that hundreds of Bitcoin users had dodged a bullet. Plenty of other hackers, virtually guaranteed of anonymity, would not have been so considerate.\nHis automated script looked for repeated \u201cR values\u201d in private key generation, which allowed Bitcoin private keys to be exposed. Many of the amounts he swept were from private addresses he\u2019d swept before, meaning users were continuing to use compromised wallets.\nImpressed by Moral Standards\nSatoshiLabs Co-Founder and CEO Alena Vranova told Bitcoin.com the company had first approached Hoenicke in 2014\u00a0(around the time he was returning the Blockchain coins), impressed by his attitude and moral standards.\nAt the time he declined due to his academic commitments. She\u00a0explained:\n\n\nWe reached back to Jochen again some time ago and were lucky to get a \u2018YES.\u2019 Having Johoe on board will help us go faster towards TREZOR 2.0.\n\n\nHoenicke will continue his research work at the University of Oldenburg in Germany, where he has a Masters and PhD in computer science, and work remotely unless it is necessary to come to SatoshiLabs HQ in the Czech Republic.\nHoenicke had previously also identified and patched a vulnerability in TREZOR known as a \u201cside-channel attack.\u201d The vulnerability could have allowed him to extract private keys from devices using older-version firmware by measuring the voltage in its USB connector cable.\nThe SatoshiLabs Team\nThe Future of TREZOR:\u00a0Secure Cloud Computing\nVranova added the next generation TREZOR 2.0 \u201cwill bring improvements in many areas.\u201d\n\u201cWe are changing the hardware design and the entire software architecture,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cThe goal is to introduce a user-friendly encryption device to secure our digital life and valuables.\u201d\nTREZOR\u2019s main selling point is that it is a single purpose device with a trusted display; a piece of hardware\u00a0that generates and stores\u00a0cryptographic keys, keeping them completely apart\u00a0from the internet.\nFuture versions would see TREZOR devices securing more than just cryptocurrencies, Vranova said, adding:\n\n\nWithout compromising on the safety of bitcoins, TREZOR can secure smart contracts but also securely login to websites and systems or encrypt any documents and data. All in one click.\n\n\nThe software stack will encourage open source development of \u201cTREZOR Apps\u201d \u2013 security applications for any service, company or individual dealing with private data online.\nSatoshiLabs is preparing to showcase an application for encrypting sensitive user data to the cloud with the new TREZOR Password Manager (TPM) within a few days.\n\u201cTPM is an example of how an individual can have an ultimately secure cloud storage in his own hands,\u201d added\u00a0Vranova.\u00a0\u201cAlso it showcases how a password manager software could address the vulnerability of the master password and the availability of the service beyond users\u2019 usual devices. Finally, TREZOR 2.0 will make the user experience with such an app even better.\u201d\nHaving Johoe working closely with the team will likely enhance the reputation SatoshiLabs has earned over the past couple of years.\nThe company has a track record of hiring Bitcoin\u2019s hacking whizzes. Among its team is Marek Palatinus, aka \u201cSlush,\u201d who started the first-ever Bitcoin mining pool Slush\u2019s Pool, and Pavol Rusnak aka \u201cStick,\u201d a long-time cryptographer and active Bitcoin community participant.\nDo you use a TREZOR device?

{"url": "https://news.bitcoin.com/china-bitcoin-myths-realities/", "title": "China: Bitcoin Banks, Mines, Myths and Realities", "content": "\n\n\n\n\t            China: Bitcoin Banks, Mines, Myths and Realities            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern curiosity about Bitcoin in China remains high, but access to information is usually quite limited.\nSee also:\u00a0Bitcoin\u2019s Capital Controls Resistance a Concern says IMF as $1 Trillion Leaves China\nAs a consequence, there are a few tropes about Chinese Bitcoin activity that tend to pop up in every conversation. There are huge factory-like mining farms in the countryside. The government discourages Bitcoin use, limiting its utility to anyone other than gamblers and speculators. Chinese people are using Bitcoin to get their money out of the country.\nSome of the preconceptions are misguided \u2013 the government has never prohibited Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency trades represented only a minuscule portion of the $676 billion that left China last year.\nOthers are more accurate \u2013 those massive mining operations do exist in rural areas where electricity is cheap, and exchanges are big businesses that aim to attract traders with a love for double-figure leverage.\nA Bitcoin Bank Account Instead?\nFor this reason, Chinese startup HaoBTC\u2018s site stands out as trying to offer something more original. For starters, the company\u2019s minimalist interface looks more bank-like than a casino, and it offers interest payments on BTC deposits.\nApart from its primary function as a bitcoin wallet, there\u2019s also a \u201cfinance\u201d option for longer-term interest-bearing deposits, a multi-sig vault storage service, a simple brokerage and direct linking to fiat accounts at 11 Chinese banks.\nHaoBTC does also operate, however, a large-scale Bitcoin mine of its own \u2013 which is how it pays the aforementioned interest. The company invests its customer deposits in the mine, which sits next to a hydro-electric plant atop a dam.\nWhile other Bitcoin exchanges in China and elsewhere sometimes offer interest, the money usually comes from loaning the bitcoins to margin traders. HaoBTC says in its FAQ that over 400 BTC in interest has been paid \u2013 at 3% p.a. to ordinary wallets and 12-15.58% to \u201cfinance\u201d accounts.\nHaoBTC has a full English interface, though only China residents can link bank accounts for fiat deposits and withdrawals. Customers without Chinese bank accounts are limited to bitcoin-only services, though they can still earn interest.\nCustomers Don\u2019t Always Know What They Want\nWhen it first opened, HaoBTC offered a standard on-chain bitcoin wallet called \u201cOpenBlock,\u201d but soon shut it down after business failed to take off.\nChief Marketing Officer Eric Mu explained to Bitcoin.com the reasons, and the company\u2019s rationale for pivoting to something more bank account-like and familiar:\n\u201cAfter the first idea failed to take off, we reflected on what went wrong \u2013 the conclusion is that we should focus more on what people really want instead of what they say they do.\u201d\nWhat most Bitcoiners always say they want, Mu added, is full control of their coins with on-chain wallets and retention of their own private keys. In fact, though, many see Bitcoin as an investment, like startup shares, and are willing to take certain risks if there\u2019s a reward.\nSo by design, HaoBTC does function more like a bank, putting its customers\u2019 money into an investment that (hopefully) keeps growing in value. It also aims for more transparency than other\u00a0Chinese Bitcoin companies have had in the past, explaining the nature of Bitcoin mining, and the risks of investing and speculating on Bitcoin price.\nMining-Based Interest and Fractional-Reserves\nHaoBTC deriving its interest payments from a Bitcoin mining operation could raise some eyebrows, but in reality the Bitcoin economy does not present the wide range of investment choices that traditional financial services have.\nMu continued:\n\u201cIt is not hard to understand that the larger you are, the more ways you have in terms of cost cut \u2013 those who can afford advance payment get discount when buying hardware; they also get cheaper electricity because they hold more leverage on negotiation table. So we as miners are incentivized to increase our scale, naturally, this requires capital.\u201d\nRaising capital from banks for Bitcoin ventures was not an option in China, he said, and CEO Wu Gang used to borrow money from friends to fund growth. Paying higher interest to HaoBTC\u2019s depositors instead is actually cheaper than these\u00a0private loans.\nMu also notes that, like banks, HaoBTC operates on a fractional reserve system \u2013 because funds need to be invested in growing the mining operation. The company does not wish to hide that fact from its customers, he added, which is part of its transparency ethos.\nWhere is Bitcoin Actually Going in China?\nLike elsewhere, demand for Bitcoin waxes and wanes in China, Mu said. It\u2019s important to be wary of over-generalizing both the cryptocurrency landscape and Chinese attitudes, as most reports tend to be anecdotal.\nWhile anecdotal itself, Mu\u2019s stories from HaoBTC\u2019s Bitcoin mine in remote Sichuan province suggested a curiosity among the public.\n\u201cSome locals there expressed curiosity but they were also doubtful. Probably just like I was three years ago when I first learned about Bitcoin, they had many questions: Is it legal? Is it a Ponzi scheme? Is it secure to store? How can some numbers on computer screen be useful?\u201d\nAfter he returned home to Beijing, Mu received messages from the same people asking how to buy bitcoins.\nHaoBTC\u2019s support desk noted that several of its customers were older, or \u201cdefinitely not tech-savvy.\u201d Their inquiries were about setting up Google Authenticator, the possibility of reversing Bitcoin transactions sent to wrong addresses, and wanting to acquire bitcoins to participate in questionable investment schemes like multi-level marketing (MMM).\nAs for the future, HaoBTC is in the process of introducing a full-featured Bitcoin exchange, but is also monitoring the market closely to see what the \u201cnext big thing in the BTC space\u201d might be.\nBitcoin in China is probably more similar to the rest of the world than people think. Everyone faces the same uncertainty, the same risks, and would happily jump at the same opportunities.\nMuch of what we think we know about Bitcoin in China is true: factory-sized mines, speculation and gambling, and government suspicion are all present. But the time is also coming where we look beyond those few cliches and notice new ideas evolving.\nGiven the lack of communication between China and the rest of the world, both in language and access to social media, it\u2019s possible the rest of the Bitcoin world may have something to gain by observing what industry participants are doing, and see if they might work in other countries as well.\nWould you like to know more about what goes on in the Chinese Bitcoin industry? How would you feel about using China-based Bitcoin services from abroad?\n\nImages courtesy of HaoBTC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Share this story:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Tags in this story\n                \n\nChina, China Bitcoin, Chinese bitcoin mining, Eric Mu, HaoBTC \n\n\n\n                    Related\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCraig Wright Ordered to Produce a List of Early Bitcoin Addresses in Kleiman Lawsuit                    \n\n\n\t\t            NEWS | 23 hours ago \n\n\t\t\t\t\tOn April 28, the high profile Kleiman v.

A company spokesperson confirmed to Bitcoin.com the announcement is authentic, but was not able to offer any more details on timing or the identity of the processor.\nRegistered developers may ask their own questions in Steamworks\u2019 official developer forum.\nAs is typically the case with vendors accepting bitcoin payments, Valve itself will not hold any bitcoin itself, and all value volatility risk will be borne by the (as-yet unnamed) processor. Prices will continue to be listed in local currency.\nSteam: Huge User Base\nSteam is a multi-platform software distribution system that allows customers to save and update games, contacts, chat and social media data in the cloud. Sales are handled through the online Steam Store.\nAccepting bitcoin would be another potentially large use-case for digital currency. According to Gamespot, Steam hit a record high number of concurrent users at the end of October 2015, with 12.5 logged into the platform. Its total registered user base, however, is some 125 million strong.\nIt is one of the world\u2019s most popular PC gaming platforms \u2013 offering over 6,000 games for Windows users, over 2,000 for OS X and 1,500 for Linux. Users can manage their game libraries from other devices including mobiles, and game content can be stored in the cloud.\nWhat Customers are Buying\nSteam customers may have spent as much as $3.5 billion\u00a0USD on games alone in 2015, although that spending estimate refers to game sales alone, not other paid downloadable content available in-game.\nTracking site SteamSpy lists the platform\u2019s top games and retail prices. The current top sellers are the beta version for Don\u2019t Starve Together with 4,106,024 users, and SpeedRunners with 1,043,098. Ranked content prices are in the range of $6.99 to $59.99.\nSome third-party Steam key resellers have provided a bitcoin and other cryptocurrency payment options in the past, often in the form of gift cards. Offering direct payments would eliminate the need for that extra step, however, and give customers a more reliable option to pay.\nWill adding another major online retailer to the fold have any effect on the bitcoin price? Would you\u00a0shop for games on the Steam Store with bitcoin when it\u2019s offered?\n\n\u00a0\nImages courtesy of Twitter,\u00a0steamfreecodes.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Share this story:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Tags in this story\n                \n\nGaming, Steam \n\n\n\n                    Related\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCraig Wright Ordered to Produce a List of Early Bitcoin Addresses in Kleiman Lawsuit                    \n\n\n\t\t            NEWS | 23 hours ago \n\n\t\t\t\t\tOn April 28, the high profile Kleiman v.

Technology groups from these legacy banks considered these various distributed ledgers after viewing a previous test with the Ethereum blockchain connecting 11 lenders on the Microsoft Azure platform.\nAlso read:\u00a0Increasing Bitcoin Block Size vs. Higher Transaction Fees\nR3 Reports That Major Global Banks Race to the\u00a0Blockchain\nThe competing blockchain technologies in the trials consisted of Chain, Ethereum, Intel, Eris Industries Ltd., and IBM. The explored research conducted looked into trading securities and executions without the need for a third party. The testing took place over the course of two weeks, and Chief Information Officers got insight into how this technology could work for them. \nHead of R3\u2019s Collaborative Lab, Tim Grant, stated: \u00a0\n\nWe have raised the bar significantly with the sheer number of global financial institutions, distributed ledger technologies and cloud providers working together to demonstrate how this nascent technology can be applied to an actively traded asset class.\n\nThe R3 CEV organization believes distributed ledgers can reshape the landscape in the financial world and beyond. For the two week period, they researched and tested many types of settlement practices involving commercial paper trading. This includes issuing, trading and redeeming exchanges propagated on a blockchain network. The purpose of these trials is to perfect a technology without the need for human execution, which in turn will cut costs drastically in the future. The company Chain is a firm that wants to build a network of blockchains that can communicate. Chain\u00a0CEO Adam Ludwin said the R3 testing is bolstering distributed ledger technology in a positive direction, stating:\n\nR3 is further accelerating the adoption of blockchain technology by demonstrating, instead of simply asserting, the commercial advantages of this emerging approach to financial services.\u00a0\n\nR3s global head and managing director Tim Grant said that each platform was tested in their\u00a0own unique ways. The trials included basic digital ledger executions and projects like IBM based in a cloud service. \u201cThis is the first time many ledgers have been run in parallel by many institutions in a rigorous, scientific way,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Grant. \nR3 declined to comment on the performance of each project but said some ledgers managed to execute\u00a0more complex transactions. Findings are being shared between financial institution members of R3 CEV\u2019s program to evaluate the testing procedure and blockchain vendors.\nBlockchain Tech Is Also Creating Jobs\nBanks everywhere are moving extremely fast to proclaim a space in these emerging markets. In result,\u00a0job openings are\u00a0appearing more often on the web searching for blockchain specialists from entities such as Thomson Reuters, Visa, and BNY Mellon. \nVisa is also working with the blockchain connector Chain and is hiring a senior software engineer who can test proof-of-concepts. Reuters is looking for someone who understands Ethereum and other distributed technologies. Executives from the digital currency industry are also looking for developers who understand the technology.\nBlockchain technology is continuing its upward trend in interest, research and development. R3 CEV and the many other banks trialing this technology are focusing in on many aspects of today\u2019s financial infrastructure. R3 says the next set of testing and research will work with government officials and regulators. \nGrant adds that\u00a0the organization will also experiment and see how distributed ledgers cooperate vis-a-vis\u00a0legacy transaction systems. Ultimately,\u00a0these traditional businesses hope\u00a0to get a better understanding of this emerging technology\u00a0to cut operational costs and run more efficiently.\nWhat do you think about these all of these financial institutions testing blockchain technology?

Previously, in the first paragraph, the article stated that 90% of every sale went to Ulbricht\u2019s defense fund, when it is 10% of every sale.\nBitcoin apparel company All Things Bitcoin now sells a Silk Road t-shirt, and 10% of every sale goes to the Ross Ulbricht Legal Defense Fund. This fund is hosted by the Free Ross Campaign, led by Ross\u2019 mother Lyn Ulbricht. Currently, the Free Ross Campaign is raising money for Ross\u2019 appeal fund. \nAlso read: Free Ross to Host \u2018The Trial I Saw\u2019 Artwork Fundraiser\nAll Things Bitcoin Helping Ross Ulbricht\nPriced at $19.99 USD, the Silk Road shirt has a simplistic design, featuring the original Silk Road logo set against a solid color background. The shirt comes in a variety of colors and sizes. The men\u2019s version of the tee is available in creme, purple and light blue, and sizes range from X-Small to XXX-Large. The women\u2019s shirt comes in fuchsia, mint, purple and light blue, ranging from Small to XX-Large.\n\nIn the men\u2019s section, there is a \u201csilhouette\u201d version of the Silk Road tee, featuring a silhouetted rendition of the original Silk Road logo. Also priced at $19.99, this shirt is available in purple, navy and black, from sizes X-Small to XXX-large.\nThe Silk Road t-shirts, as well as all clothing items sold by All Things Bitcoin, are \u201cdesigned on American Apparel.\u201d Therefore, the company claims that each item comes with American Apparel quality, which includes:\n\nDouble stitched\nStandard fit\nDirect-to-garment (DTG) printing \n100% Cotton\nSweatshop free\n\nThe company also sells a Silk Road poster for $19.99. The 12\u201d x 18\u201d poster displays the same Silk Road logo as the t-shirts, set against a grey background. Just as with the t-shirts, 10% of every poster sale goes to the Ros Ulbricht Legal Defense Fund.\n\nWe donate 10% of every sale to the Ross Ulbricht Legal Defense Fund, in bitcoin. Every donation helps. If you would like to donate directly to his fund, or would like to find out more, you can do so at FreeRoss.org.\n\nAll Things Bitcoin offers a variety of t-shirts and accessories in addition to its Silk Road merchandise. One of the more interesting items available on the website is a \u201cWill work for Bitcoin\u201d shirt. In the foreground of this solid grey graphic-tee is an image of a brown cardboard sign that reads, \u201cWill Work For Bitcoin.\u201d There is a QR code in the bottom-right corner of the sign, which the company can link to a public bitcoin address specified by customers in their orders. This shirt goes for $29.99, but there is a $19.99 version that does not have the QR code.\nWhat do you think about All Things Bitcoin?

{"url": "https://news.bitcoin.com/dash-powered-soda-machine-to-debut-at-miami-bitcoin-conference/", "title": "DASH-Powered Soda Machine to Debut at Miami Bitcoin Conference", "content": "\n\n\n\n\t            DASH-Powered Soda Machine to Debut at Miami Bitcoin Conference            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporters of DASH, the privacy-centric cryptocurrency, hope to highlight what they believe are its strengths at the upcoming North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami. They are doing so in an intriguing way: by setting up a soda vending machine that accepts DASH for payment at the Conference. Dubbed \u201cDash N\u2019 Drink,\u201d the vending machine is intended to promote Dash\u2019s \u201cInstantX\u201d technology, which can secure a transaction without the need to wait for a block confirmation.\nAlso Read: DASH Goes Up 20% After Lamassu Integration Approved\n\u201cDash N\u2019 Drink\u201d is the brainchild of Dustin Eward and Jeremy Maus, two long-time DASH users. Bitcoin.com reached out to Eward and Maus to discuss their project.\n\n\u00a0\nOrigins of Dash N\u2019 Drink\nBitcoin.com (BC): What initiated the Dash N\u2019 Drink Soda Machine project?\nEward/Maus (E/M): A conversation on Dashtalk.org started between us with the goal of creating a point-of-sale project to highlight InstantX technology. What we needed was a closed development platform that wouldn\u2019t interfere with the Point-of-Sale systems of existing businesses. A soda machine was chosen as a proof of concept and stepping stone for bigger ideas.\nBC: How was the Dash N\u2019 Drink funded?\n\nE/M: The Dash N\u2019 Drink has been funded so far by Dash\u2019s built-in self-governance system. A proposal was submitted to the DASH budget system for voting. Within a week, it received enough votes and was successfully funded directly from the blockchain.\nInstantX Technology\nBC: How is the Dash N\u2019 Drink different from any other Crypto-based point of sale machine?\n\nE/M: The Dash N\u2019 Drink does not rely on 0-confirmations or accepting a payment before it is secured in the blockchain. It also does not wait for a block confirmation which could take several minutes. The machine uses Dash\u2019s InstantX technology which secures a transaction without the need to wait for a block confirmation.\n\nAlso, the fee to purchase from the Dash N\u2019 Drink machine is one of the lowest for any crypto, at only 3 cents per InstantX transaction. After the upcoming Dash Evolution release, this fee will be omitted for most transactions.\nBC: How does InstantX work?\n\nE/M: InstantX uses Dash\u2019s second-tier masternode network to lock a transaction. This network-wide locking prevents double spend attempts and cannot be reversed, similar to inclusion in the blockchain. This has been tested to take less than a second with our soda machine. This technology will provide merchants a clear advantage to other payment methods without relying on a 3rd party processor for transactions.\nBC: How do you plan to demo it at the Miami conference?\n\nE/M: We plan to demonstrate how the InstantX Soda Machine can facilitate real-time cryptocurrency transactions securely. We designed the machine to accept Dash InstantX transactions by mobile phones via scanning a QR code. At the show, we will be offering paper wallets preloaded with Dash. We have designed a custom Android mobile app for the show that can quickly import funds from a paper wallet and allow immediate spending using InstantX. The user scans the QR code with that mobile app and then purchases a beverage in less than a second. We are also planning to demonstrate a remote InstantX purchase from a user at an outside location.\nGoing Forward\nBC: What is the plan for the Dash N\u2019 Drink and the team after the Miami conference?\n\nE/M: Mainly the machine will be used as a retail traffic billboard. We are in a unique position to not be affiliated with a particular supplier, which enables us to place the machine in many strategic places. Our future plans will include open sourcing the Dash N\u2019 Drink InstantX code and other ambitious projects for point of sale technology tailored for retail merchants.\nBC: How can people interested in the Dash N\u2019 Drink find more information?\n\nE/M: The Dash N\u2019 Drink website is at\u00a0www.dashndrink.com. The Dash website is at\u00a0www.dash.org.\nWhat do you think? Is the Dash N\u2019 Drink a viable point-of-sale machine? Does InstantX solve the problem of 0-confirmations?

Fagan of Business Insider penned an article\u00a0in December on the perils of cryptocurrency anonymity. He rambled for several paragraphs about the horrors of hidden, peer-to-peer money transfers, and how they will cause massive oppression and spur unprecedented levels of money laundering. His\u00a0article incited\u00a0alarmist and propagandist paranoia\u00a0because the understanding of cryptocurrency Fagan exhibited was insufficient for writing a coherent, rational critique. As a result, the author committed several errors.\u00a0\nAlso Read:\u00a0Bitcoin was Built to Incite Peaceful Anarchy\n\nFalse narrative\nOne area the author focused on was the prospect of money laundering, especially through the use of more anonymous cryptocurrencies like Zero Coin. He believes that if these more furtive means of using currency\u00a0become widespread, money laundering and criminality will likewise increase.\nHe said:\n\u201cTo summarize my argument: transnational crime is a global business valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars, and criminals need a way to easily launder, move, and invest that money to make it worth the risk. I brought up two examples-rhino poaching and human trafficking-in the op-ed, but there are dozens more crimes (including drug trafficking and weapons smuggling) to which you can refer.\u201d\nThere is no doubt that criminals\u00a0will use any valuable currency, conceal and smuggle it into legitimate financial sectors. However, the idea that cryptocurrencies may\u00a0ease\u00a0this process, even in the form of\u00a0Zero Coin dark wallets, is a non-argument. There is little evidence to back the\u00a0claim up, and the author offered none. Fagan\u2019s position\u00a0is\u00a0hocus pocus.\nHere is why: criminals already use cash with no paper trail. They move money around with mules and stow it away in various places with no hassle. Even If they had fewer options for hiding their stash, enterprising drug lords could bury it\u00a0underground like Pablo Escobar did.\u00a0These kingpins also have many ways maneuver their ill-gotten gains into the books of acceptable businesses. Furthermore,\u00a0there are also banks and companies that have laundered millions, sometimes billions without ever touching\u00a0cryptocurrency.\nDuring the 2000\u2019s, HSBC banks laundered millions for terrorist campaigns, drug traffickers, and all manner of other nefarious entities. Then there\u2019s the Black Market Colombian Drug Peso Exchange, which is considered to be one of the largest money laundering operations in the western hemisphere. British multinational bank Standard Chartered was also estimated to have laundered billions of dollars to Iran for various purposes. The list goes on and on, and all these used fiat currency and central banking mechanisms\u2014not cryptocurrency.\nOf course, Mr. Fagan believes\u2014without evidence\u2014that cryptocurrency\u2019s earmark anonymity will lead to more crime. But the facts tell a different story. Dangerous criminals and kingpins will use whatever funds they can get their hands on, and they will make the system bend to their will anyway. It is already extremely easy for these crooks\u00a0to clean money, and cryptocurrencies are not making a dent in the laundering schemes already under way. But another big\u00a0reason \u201cmoney laundering\u201d has ballooned\u00a0is because\u00a0of immoral and dangerous laws, which Fagan never considers.\nWhen government\u2019s ban consensual activities like drugs, prostitution, and gambling, black markets spring up to provide these goods, and money laundering becomes the natural mechanism by which \u201ccriminals\u201d protect their earnings. In the absence of silly laws, the vast amount of money laundering would vanish overnight. Furthermore,\u00a0digital money will end nonsensical laws\u00a0by undermining the government\u2019s that generate them. It is true: cryptocurrency\u00a0was\u00a0created to promote\u00a0financial freedom by stamping out government.\u00a0But strangely, Fagan believes otherwise.\nThe Argument that Politicians will Use Crypto against the People\nFagan believes\u00a0cryptocurrency will exacerbate government crimes instead of stopping them. He argues that cryptocurrencies will make governments more powerful and allow them to steal and launder more money. He sees cryptocurrencies as being a deadlier tool of control for the oppressors\u00a0because they can use these cryptos\u00a0to hurt people.\nHe said:\n\u201cThe evidence is clear: the ability to conceal movements of money is not a tool of the little guy. Those nameless oppressive governments, that bitcoin proponents oppose, are filled with corrupt officials that absolutely adore financial opacity. Tunisia has been struggling to trace the\u00a0\u00a311bn hidden abroad\u00a0by the Ben Ali regime for more than three years with little success. We may never find the majority of the Gaddafi regime\u2019s hidden money, estimated to be as much as $80 billion. Contrary to what some Bitcoin supporters espouse, anonymous financial transactions are undeniably a tool of oppression. It should be no surprise that Russia and China, two of the biggest money laundering hubs in the world, are some of the fastest growing markets for Bitcoins.\u201d\nThe evidence is far from clear. And the examples\u00a0Fagan uses are examples of laundering that take advantage of paper currencies. He is simply fantasizing that cryptos will worsen the problem, which is erroneous. His cries that cryptocurrencies will inspire\u00a0governments to\u00a0cause more oppression are based two\u00a0things: denial of how\u00a0government\u2019s commit financial crimes, and ignorance of cryptocurrency protocols.\nBitcoin is Not a Money Launderer\u2019s Dream\nFirst, Fagan ignores the current state of affairs. Governments are using centralization of financial control, lawmaking, and money printing to subjugate\u00a0people. Fagan must realize that governments use money inflation mechanisms to silently extort\u00a0the population, not to mention manipulate interest rates. These central bankers and government bureaucrats have so much power they could\u00a0even\u00a0type their own salaries into personal\u00a0computers without batting an eye. The current system allows them to plunder\u00a0everyone\u00a0legally, yet Fagan indirectly\u00a0argues\u00a0for keeping the system\u2019s heart thumping. So\u00a0ironically, when Fagan argues against cryptocurrency, he argues\u00a0against the only money that has the capability and features to\u00a0stop\u00a0oppressors and protect people.\nSecond,\u00a0in a stroke of ignorance, Fagan believes cryptocurrency worsens the current situation. This is wrong on many\u00a0levels. Cryptocurrencies were built to incite peaceful anarchy. The protocol was written in order to keep money away from centralized control and put it in the hands of the people. Arguably, even if politicians started using cryptocurrency to launder money; as soon as cryptocurrency goes public, the political elite would lose control of their financial monopoly, obliterating their power base.\nWhy would this happen? Because blockchain technology prohibits a group of sociopaths from running the system and choosing how to divvy out and circulate funds. Cryptocurrencies allow the first and true democratization of money. They make sure that power elites\u00a0cannot arbitrarily steal money wholesale by maintaining a grip on institutions that regulate\u00a0money.\nThird, a National Risk Assessment\u00a0report published by the UK government in October 2015 placed Bitcoin at the very bottom on a list ranking the preferred methods used by criminals to launder money.\n\u201cThe money laundering risk associated with digital currencies is low, though if the use of digital currencies were to become more prevalent in the UK this risk could rise,\u201d reads an excerpt from the report, adding:\n\u201cDigital currencies are currently not a method by which terrorists raise or move money out of the UK (though they remain a viable method for doing so).\u201d\nFagan\u2019s arguments are basically red herrings that ignore the deeper implications of Bitcoin, Zero Coin, and all other altcoins by focusing on the possibility of money laundering by politicians; but cryptocurrencies totally undermine their ability to wash money and control over the population.\nEven though Fagan was wrong about many issues, at least he had the courage to\u00a0challenge cypto-enthusiasts with\u00a0an opportunity to offer counterarguments.\nFagan\u2019s Challenge Accepted\nThis was his\u00a0challenge:\n\u201cDoes Zerocoin have any benefits that justify allowing these kinds of harms? I haven\u2019t heard anyone make that case. So here\u2019s the challenge to supporters of anonymous money transfer: Make an affirmative case for it. Give examples of where we\u2019ll all be better off if people can make untraceable peer-to-peer money transfers. Tell us how you are going to be substantively less free in a world where financial paper trails exist.\u201d\nAs I argued above, all cryptocurrencies were purposely built to eliminate the need for third parties. They are meant to stop the injustices perpetrated by bureaucratic and white collar criminals. All of the features of cryptocurrencies repudiate\u00a0this fact. They are peer-to-peer, decentralized, uncontrolled by custodians, and encrypted with public-key cryptography. They are the best possible monetary guardians of the little man.\nWith this knowledge of encryption protocols fully realized, it is easy to see why everyone will be better off with untraceable peer-to-peer money as opposed to the fiat system. People will not have to rely on governmental control of money; they can be their own bank, dodge taxation regiments, prevent authorities from seizing funds, equalize monetary transactions, and maintain total self-responsibility in financial matters. They can take back the power. They no longer have to kneel before the altar of the monetary elite.\nI just hope that Fagan will take\u00a0a second look at digital cryptocurrency, and try\u00a0to understand it and evaluate the history of why it was created. Perhaps he will change his mind. Perhaps all naysayers will.\n\nImages courtesy of Eatmoreheat.com, psychologyofgames.com, traxaarmstrong.com\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Share this story:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Tags in this story\n                \n\nAnonymity, E.L.

The budget proposal is part of DASH\u2019s decentralized governance system. Every so often, a budget proposal is submitted to the blockchain, anyone can do this. If enough Master Nodes vote on it, it passes and the proposal gets funded from a portion of the DASH mining rewards. The voting mechanism is secured by proof of stake, since Master Nodes need to lock 1000 DASH to earn the right to vote, among other perks.\nThe proposal included various big announcements, the most notable of them, the integration with Lamassu BTMs, which in 2014 comprised 40% of all Bitcoin ATMs worldwide. Duffield writes: \n\u201cCrypto ATMs will help bring DASH into the everyday life of regular users and increase utility by providing a physical bridge into the network. Dash is partnering with Deginner, a development firm with experience with the Lamassu machines and the awareness of Lamassu to perform the integration.\n\n\u201cSupport over a longer time frame is required to ensure the integration will be maintained for any changes in Dash or the Lamassu system, for this, Deginner will include a two year support for the integration. Ira Miller, from Deginner, has been instrumental in opening this opportunity for Dash by leading the conversation with the Lamassu team and making sure they are aware of the project.\u201d \nToday, Lamassu holds about 26% of the market share of BTMs around the world, with 141 of them live, according to\u00a0Coinatmradar, still first in market adoption, followed by Genesis Coin. \n\n\nHe adds that \u201cone key requirement of the integration is for Dash to be able to be presented to the user side-by-side with Bitcoin,\u201d explaining that DASH will be offered to BTM operators as an optional add-on, which they can activate by \u201cselecting an option in the menu.\u201d So it will not be by default on every Lamassu, which means operators need to be sold on why they should activate DASH. It will be interesting to see how Lamassu operators respond.\nThis represents a critical entry into the cash-to-crypto market for DASH, assuming enough BTMs activate it and the growth rate of BTMs continues as it has. As with this one integration, the option will be available on all future, compatible Lamassu wallets and backends.\n\nThis also sets a standard that other altcoins may follow. Zach Hervey, CEO and Co-Founder of Lamassu, Inc. told Bitcoin.com how this deal came to be, saying:\n\n\u201cIra [Miller] from Deginner approached us regarding using our open source software for developing a Dash Lamassu version and we\u2019re happy he\u2019s doing it. Especially, since he has some experience fiddling with the Lamassu machine in Panama. In general, we\u2019re open to merging well-supported pull requests that meet our standards \u00a0and have proper demand.\u201d \u200b\nWith this, Ira Miller Co-Founder of coinpapult and Deginner, secured a one\u00a0year contract for 610 DASH per month or about $2,000 USD at current prices, straight out of the DASH blockchain. In response to how fast this developed and was almost certainly approved. Miller tweeted out:\n\n\nFascinating to see effective blockchain governance in real time @Dashpay @LamassuBTC integration budget voting https://t.co/wxs3rHulXo\n\u2014 Ira Miller (@iravagecoins) December 28, 2015\n\nWell, it looks like speculators and or investors alike, are bullish about this development, because the price of DASH went up by nearly 25% since the announcement on the 28th. DASH now rests as the 5th largest cryptocurrency, following Ethereum and then Litecoin, and at the time of writing, trading at $3.48 USD.\n\n\nThere are still a few days of voting ahead, but with over 1,500 yes votes to 10 No votes, it is pretty much a done deal. \nWhat do you think about this big activity surrounding Dash?

Its storage being decentralized grants the information it holds a high amount of trust in the minds of its users, whom in turn rely upon this record to engage in further trade and finance.\nIt is this characteristic of the blockchain that has brought Bitcoin developers and pioneers to lead engineer workshops like \u201cRebooting the web of trust,\u201d with names like Vitalik Buterin, Peter Todd, Gregory Maxwell, and Joel Dietz as well as renown software engineers like Christopher Allen and legendary cryptographers like Jon Callas, the former CTO of PGP.\nThe Problems With Using Blockchain Reputation Systems\nThe capacity to\u00a0store information about people\u2019s reliability in terms of\u00a0transactions they engage in, contracts they sign or\u00a0promises they make, is what binds these two communities. Its purpose, to prevent future abuse or default risk.\nHowever, reputation and identity systems are not only very complex both in theory and practice, but they present a grave potential danger to humanity; that of a world where every individual\u2019s actions are judged by standards they don\u2019t necessarily agree with and which mark them in a global, non-changeable record, turning the Web of Trust into a Web of Shame.\nFurthermore, the whole purpose of a reputation system is to prevent abuse and default risk. So are we solving the wrong problem by focusing on reputation and identity systems rather than \u201ctrustless\u201d smart contracts, decentralized escrow and multisignature tools? Andreas Antonopoulos thinks so.\nIn a recent interview with DisrupTek.info at Labitconf 2015, he illuminated this danger saying:\n\u201cIn traditional finance we use reputation as a proxy to identifying the default risk associated with a specific identity and that is because identity is part of all financial transactions.\u00a0The biggest problem I have with reputation is that it is not what we are trying to establish. Reputation does not matter; what matters is default risk.\u201d\nReputation systems are kind of an archaic technology. It developed out of tribal communities as a way to prevent abuse and discourage theft. Tribes effectively had a kind of permanent memory because they were small enough to remember all members of their community. A capacity that is not scalable to more than about 150 people \u2014 something called\u00a0Dunbar\u2019s Number\u00a0\u2014 which refers to how many people we can remember. We don\u2019t have this on the internet.\n\n\u201cThey are a relic of traditional financial systems because they don\u2019t have better ways of managing default risk. Whereas in Bitcoin we do have better ways of managing default risk. Smart Contracts, Multisig, Escrow, and a whole bunch of tools. It\u2019s very important to be able to do anonymous transactions and remove default risk, without having to attach reputation and identity, \u201d explained Antonopoulos.\nOne of the biggest problems with identity systems according to Antonopoulos is that they raise a barrier as to who can enter a financial market. As soon as you require to give a reputation score, such as a credit score to access credit and financial tools, you are excluding a vast amount of people from the market.\nWhen it comes to something like bitcoin loans where today there is no scaled or established way to enforce payment of a debt, online reputation systems have risen to bring a higher quality of information to investors. Take for example BTCJam, the bitcoin lending platform, which you must link with social media accounts and recommendations to raise your score and have a better shot at a loan.\nEven with all this information, participants still default on loans because they either innocently misinvest the funds or become the victims of fraud. When asked if investors need to accept the fact that some of their loans will never be paid, Antonopoulos said:\n\u201cI think the real issue with loans is concentration of risk, not the individual default risk.\u201d\n\u201cIf I have a loan for example \u2013 to loan out money to two thousand farmers, I use Kiva and Lending Club, in 1 investor of thousands, and my portfolio consists of thousands of loans, 2- 5 dollars per loan, so I have a default rate which is like 10%,\u201d he continued.\n\u201cWhich would be high in any other environment. I don\u2019t care because its spread among so many investors and my portfolio is so diversified that I don\u2019t have concentration of risk. Moreover, for all the bad performing loans I have so many more that are good.\u201d\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t need to worry about collateralizing or reputation or any of those things. In fact, reputation and collateral force you to exclude financial inclusion.\u201d\n\u201cIn fact, one of the biggest barriers to financial inclusion is the lack of collateral and the lack of reputational metrics, so they are excluded from the financial system completely, whereas with anonymous and mass diversification of lending you can now do a lot more inclusion. Reputation to me is a huge barrier to global economic inclusion.\u201d\nThis does, however, beg the question of the dreaded Sybil attack. Where a few parties create large quantities of fake accounts to maximize the amount of fraud they can inflict on a system.\nReputation or Default Risk?\nIn defense of reputation systems, Christopher Allen, organizer of the Rebooting the Web of Trust workshop, and Blockchain consultant with Alacrity Software says:\n\u201cI agree that avoiding default risk is important in financial transactions, but there are all kinds of other interactions that we make in life where bad actors (just following their own interests or actively subverting) cause problems. An example of a bad actor just following their own interests is the source of the tragedy of the commons and other forms of free loading. An example of a bad actor actively subverting is the troll or the malicious hacker \u2014 there was no default risk in the Sony attack, but they lost millions.\nThere is a quote from Noah Thorpe that I call \u2018Thorp\u2019s Law\u2019 \u2014 \u2018Any conversation about decentralization eventual evolves to a conversation about reputation\u2019 (my corollary is to substitute devolve for the word evolve). This is substantially true \u2014 decentralization is hard, and reputation is even harder as it intersects with more complex human systems, drives and biases.\u201d\nHe suggests interested parties check out the many papers and academic open source exploration of these topics on the Rebooting Web of Trust Github repo.\nYou can check out the full interview with Andreas Antonopoulos below:\n\nWhat do you think about\u00a0Andreas Antonopoulos\u2019 opinions on reputation systems?

{"url": "https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-kenya-public-desist-transacting-bitcoin/", "title": "Central Bank of Kenya: \u2018The Public Should Desist from Transacting in Bitcoin\u2019", "content": "\n\n\n\n\t            Central Bank of Kenya: \u2018The Public Should Desist from Transacting in Bitcoin\u2019            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has issued a warning to the public on the use and trading of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. In a Gazette notice, the regulator has also declared that \u201cno entity is currently licensed to offer money remittance services and products in Kenya using virtual currencies such as Bitcoin.\u201d\nAlso read: Kenyan President Nominates BitPesa Board Member for Cabinet\nBitcoin is not legal tender in Kenya\nThe regulators notice fell short of declaring the use of virtual currencies illegal in the country only describing them as \u201cnot legal tender.\u201d\nAn excerpt reads:\n\n\u201c\u201dCBK reiterates that Bitcoin and similar products are not legal tender nor are they regulated in Kenya.The public should therefore desist from transacting in Bitcoin and similar products.\u201d\u201d\n\nThis comes after a high court in Nairobi on December 14th, 2015 declined to issue interim orders to compel Safaricom to resume Mpesa services to customers buying or selling Bitcoins using Bitpesa, a Bitcoin exchange that has relied heavily on the mobile service to serve its customers.\nCentral Bank of Kenya\nWhether this new development is in some way linked to the ongoing Bitpesa vs. Safaricom court case, is not clear yet. However, a blog post by Elizabeth Rossielo, the CEO Bitpesa, published on December\u00a014th suggests the central bank would issue a statement.\n\u201cThe Central Bank of Kenya may or may not make an official statement on digital currencies or Bitcoin during this case, because this case is not about the legality of Bitcoin in Kenya,\u201d reads the blog post.\nBitcoin.com reached out to Bitpesa\u2019s compliant officer Fred Fedynyshyn, to confirm whether the notice has anything to do with the case currently in court. However, Fedynyshyn replied that Bitpesa could not yet comment on the notice.\n\u2018Desist from transacting in Bitcoin\u2019\nSome of the reasons the notice raises as the ground for the public to be wary about virtual currencies include that they are untraceable, anonymous, have no underlying value, and are volatile. \u201cThere is no underlying or backing of assets and the value of virtual currencies is speculative in nature,\u201d asserts the notice, \u201cThis may result in high volatility in value of virtual currencies thus exposing users to potential losses.\u201d\nBitpesa web interface\nThe reaction from the local Bitcoin community has been varied. \u201cI am Happy they finally came out and made comments in public,\u201d Michael Kimani, a Kenyan Bitcoin trader and enthusiast, told Bitcoin.com. \u201c Although I disagree with their press release on some points regarding untraceability, anonymity, regulation around the world and virtual currency platform risk.\u201d\nHe further elaborated that this warning was not unique to Kenya. Kimani:\n\u201cOther central banks around the world have started this way, and then eased up. I see the same will happen here. Just a matter of time\u201d\nWill this help or hurt Bitcoin in Kenya?

You and I share\u00a0much in common. We were both raised in Texas. But more poignantly, we have shared traumatic experiences. And though these experiences are not exactly identical, I can empathize with some of what you have endured. I too was a victim of the drug war. I have felt the cold steel of the State\u2019s gun pressed against my temple. I have seen the inside of a jail, but I was just lucky to break free of those fetters, thanks to family, friends, and a bit of good fortune.\nBut even through my experiences, I never mustered your courage. I did not commit my \u201cwrongdoing\u201d on principle. I was just a kid doing kid things. I was immature and rash of heart. What you did was heroic, beautiful even. You actively sought to subvert political slavery. You wanted to experiment with sovereignty and share its pleasures with everyone; and in my eyes, you accomplished this task. You adhered to philosophy. You navigated your plan through the Silk Road with the end goal of making the world a better place.\n\nWe cannot yet fathom\u00a0the full scope\u00a0of your project, but it has already\u00a0shaped the lives of thousands. It has affected\u00a0the way\u00a0people conceptualize free markets, and already etched itself in the annals of history. Many people have followed your lead, because your actions were\u00a0ones of principled liberty.\nI wish I would have exercised this\u00a0same conviction and honor. I wish I would have been as ideological and brave at the time of my misdeed. I wouldn\u2019t have doubted the virtue of my actions. That is why you have my lifelong allegiance. I will always support your cause with every fiber\u00a0of my being, even if you question whether your own actions\u00a0were good.\nI had the pleasure of meeting your mother, Lyn. She let me know your actions were just. A mother may indeed be biased toward her son, but a mother\u2019s love also betrays the innocence within\u00a0her son\u2019s heart.\nShe spoke at Porcfest and I witnessed her eloquently unravel the secrets of the kangaroo court you received. Your mother delivered your truth\u00a0with such spirited\u00a0fervor and passion that I was blown\u00a0away. Her ire for your predicament was palpable. I knew through her voice that you did not deserve your fate. You were dealt a great injustice. But she laid the truth on the table.\nI wept\u00a0at the pinnacle of\u00a0the\u00a0speech. Her words brought all of my memories bubbling to the surface. At that point, I knew I would become a loyal supporter of you and your family. Her words allowed me to relive my experiences and vaguely comprehend your struggle. It inspired me.\n\nAfter the presentation, I spoke with her for a moment off stage. I told her a little about my past legal troubles, as well as the activism I am involved in. I told her I was only loosely\u00a0familiar with your situation\u00a0until she clarified it.\nWe met again the next day, and I purchased a shirt from her. We spoke more about your trial, and about what I intend to do to help. It was a bittersweet conversation. Your mom\u2019s heart weighed heavy. I saw your\u00a0pain mirrored in her eyes. I felt a cascade of emotions surge through me, and she recognized them. Lyn said she saw something in me, and that I stood out. We bonded deeply in that moment. I will never forget our exchange.\nI left Porcfest knowing\u00a0I wanted to do more for you and liberty. I returned home and I started writing more ardently. I created my own activist web page to help educate people about freedom\u00a0and Bitcoin. I did this in part thanks to you and your mother\u2019s courage. To this day, I talk to everyone about your situation. I wear your shirt in public and start conversations. I take selfies with it\u00a0and share it online. I implore people to consider\u00a0the good you did. I do what I can to rally the population to your defense. I want to rise to your level of courage and honor, especially since I feel your pain reflected in my past.\nAnd like many have\u00a0said in their letters, I do not feel you will be locked forever away and forgotten. I believe someone will take notice of the grievous injustice you experienced. Some, I believe, already have. Your mom posted this quotation\u00a0on\u00a0the Free Ross Facebook page:\n\u201cIf only 10% of what Lyn said about the trial and the events leading up to the trial are true, there should be a reversal. As a former prosecutor, I am appalled at what the federal government has done to Ross.\u201d\nI hope this news, as well as my empathy, compassion, and hope finds you well and unhurt. I hope you are being treated with the dignity and decency you deserve. You are a blessing to the world, and may the world never\u00a0forget. I will not.\nSincerely,\nSterlin Lujan\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Share this story:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Tags in this story\n                \n\nBitcoin, Drug War, Free Ross, Injustice, Lyn Ulbricht, Market Economy, Open Letters, Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road, War on Drugs \n\n\n\n                    Related\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCraig Wright Ordered to Produce a List of Early Bitcoin Addresses in Kleiman Lawsuit                    \n\n\n\t\t            NEWS | 18 hours ago \n\n\t\t\t\t\tOn April 28, the high profile Kleiman v.

I keep a few $5 USD bills in my car so I can share them with panhandlers when I drive by, and it struck me that it would be really convenient to pair Bitholla with this process \u2013 when I see a homeless person, I could look at their profile on Bitholla and make a donation that way. You might argue that it\u2019s less personal, but you can actually chat with people on Bitholla if you choose. The best part of the social nature of Bitholla is that you can continue to give long after you\u2019ve parted ways with someone.\nBitcoin.com (BC): How did you first hear of Bitholla?\nHenry Jones (HJ): My first exposure to Bitholla was on The Daily Decrypt Episode 31. It was one of those things that I felt good about on the first exposure (like Bitcoin) and instantly felt like it was a game-changing app.\nThe first recipient of one of Jones\u2019 Bitcoin-equipped phones\nSince then I\u2019ve shared it with a bunch of my friends and been in contact with the development team. They\u2019re a good bunch of people. I was pleased to find out that they are committed to keep Bitholla free for the long term.\nBC: What has your experience been with the Indigent Bitcoin Project thus far? How have the homeless people you\u2019ve approached reacted?\nHJ: The project has been rewarding for me personally \u2013 it makes me put my money where my values are.\n\u201cI sincerely believe that Bitcoin is a huge growth sector and I believe that by sharing Bitcoin with people of little means, I am helping them now and in the future.\u201d\nThe reception has been modest \u2014 at first I sort of dropped the devices with people and left. As I spend more time refining the practice, I have begun to spend some time with the recipients to learn more about them and take time to introduce Bitcoin and how the device can be used. It has really encouraged me to value people as individuals and not see people as projects. The most surprising thing to me is that many homeless people aren\u2019t as aware of free WiFi as I thought they would be.\nBC: What in your estimation is the single greatest cause of poverty/homelessness?\nHJ: I imagine that mental health issues and substance abuse problems are significant contributors to homelessness, but I don\u2019t really dwell on the big questions \u2013 instead, I do what I can to help make someone else\u2019s life just a little better. In the past I have done fundraising and advocacy to help a few families get into housing, and to be honest, things fell apart pretty quickly. I think I began to feel resentment that the gift wasn\u2019t handled more responsibly, but now I believe the gift is that I have an opportunity to be generous and I work hard not to judge the people who receive.\n\u201cThe gift isn\u2019t what I give to other people, it\u2019s the change that happens in my own thought process.\u201d\nBC: How have you gotten ahold of all the Android devices you\u2019re using for your project?\nHJ: I got some of them from trying perkTV for awhile, and I bought a couple more from C7recycle. I find that the Samsung Axioms are cheap enough and they work fine with a Bitcoin wallet. I end up paying about $16 USD for the devices, and I try to put $25 USD [of Bitcoin] on the phones that I share. That\u2019s a pretty substantial sum for me, but I really think giving should hurt just a little.\nBitholla sample profile\nBC: How can people support your outreach?\nHJ: My hope is that other people set up their own Bitcoin wallet devices and share them with people in their area. I\u2019d like to think that what I\u2019m doing is a personal struggle to overcome my own selfishness and I think other people would enjoy engaging in that struggle. It was neat to see some other people sharing their experience based on the Github directions that I posted \u2013 that\u2019s really gratifying.\nBC: Aside from Bitholla, what other crypto projects most excite you right now?\nHJ: I love all things crypto. I\u2019m particularly excited about the launch of OpenBazaar and Augur, I\u2019m looking forward to a truly decentralized forum like Datt. I like the decentralized data storage platforms like Storj and IPFS.\nBC: Give us a brief vision of the cryptosphere in five years.\nHJ: By vision, you have to recognize that I\u2019m not making a prediction, I\u2019m sharing my most optimistic hopes for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.\n\u201cI think the web as we know it will begin to erode as it is replaced by a decentralized network. P2P technology will make network access nearly ubiquitous\u00a0with a mesh backbone on older and highly available cellular devices.\u201d\nBanks and financial institutions will use Bitcoin for settlement, and people will no longer use savings accounts for fiat savings, preferring instead to store accumulated wealth on the blockchain. Property and deed management will begin to use smart property and smart contracts, which will be easily browsable on mobile devices. Trust in fiat currencies will wane as people realize that governments aren\u2019t equipped to both tax and print money. US taxes will be payable in Bitcoin.\n\nMicrotransactions will eliminate the need for content distributors and transactions will point to valuable content on the network. In fact, people will engage in a thousand microtransactions per day, most of which they won\u2019t even be aware of.\nThere will be 5-8 well-developed Bitcoin clients in use around the world based on local preferences, but all cooperating on the same network. Bitcoin Core will develop a governance model that limits the impact of any individual or small group of individuals. People will realize that \u201cthe early years of Bitcoin\u201d weren\u2019t 2009-2010, but that they are still continuing \u2014 lots of people will tell stories about how they derided Bitcoin and \u201calmost\u201d got involved, but decided against it, only to regret the decision for years.\n\nJones\u2019 Bitholla homeless outreach efforts can be followed and/or contributed to on his Github page.\nHave you tried Bitholla?

{"url": "https://news.bitcoin.com/skeptic-evangelist-economist-jeffrey-tucker-bits-freedom/", "title": "From Skeptic to Evangelist: Economist Jeffrey Tucker on the Bits of Freedom", "content": "\n\n\n\n\t            From Skeptic to Evangelist: Economist Jeffrey Tucker on the Bits of Freedom            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin evangelist Jeffrey Tucker was not always a believer. The highly-trained economist, hailing from fellowships at the Mises Institute and the Acton Institute, initially struggled with how a non-tangible item could possibly qualify as money, much less \u201csound money.\u201d But Bitcoin\u2019s\u00a0persistence\u00a0as a medium of exchange kept Tucker on a fiery path of research which eventually lead to a crypto-romance that everyone in the libertarian world is familiar with.\nAlso read: The Banking System Is Obsolete: Bitcoin and the Blockchain Are the Future\nTucker went on to organize\u00a0CryptocurrencyCon 2013, and recently\u00a0authored Bit by Bit: How P2P is Freeing the World. Bitcoin.com caught up with the busy economist, whose interview schedule is something to be envied, to discover his path from Bitcoin skeptic to crypto evangelist.\n\nBitcoin.com (BC): What and when was your first experience with bitcoin?\nJeffrey Tucker (JT): It was 2011 when I first started receiving submissions on Bitcoin, to be published on an economics website. I couldn\u2019t understand the technical details and I was biased against it. I didn\u2019t believe you could make money from code. So I turned them down. Big mistake.\nAnd that\u2019s where I stood until February 2013. A group of bitcoiners surrounded me and made me an owner. My doubts began to fade. I later spent some Bitcoin online. That experience converted me. Over the following months, I wrote a dozen or so articles on the topic. \n\u201cI was surprised that I was pretty much alone in my opinions in my neck of the woods. I received a torrent of criticism.\u201d \nPart of the problem for me intellectually is that while I was convinced Bitcoin was real, I didn\u2019t really have a handle on the source of its value. It took me another year to figure out that puzzle. I\u2019m finally satisfied that I\u2019ve figured it out. \nIn the early days after actually becoming a Bitcoin owner, I finally had to ask myself whether I would believe my own theories or the evidence of my experience. I went with my experience, and that caused a shift in my own thinking.\n \u201cI got a hard lesson in humility: markets are indeed smarter than intellectuals.\u201d \nThis is why no one should ever stop looking outside the window and observing the way the world works. Markets are our best teachers.\nBC: As an economist, you report that you struggled with the \u2019moneyness\u2019 aspect of bitcoin for two whole years. Briefly describe the Austrian theory of money, your initial response to Bitcoin\u2019s having value as money, and the eventual conclusion you reached as to why it meets Austrian theories of money.\nJT: I had long believed that the only possible money that could enter the world had to grow organically from bartered goods. As I began to reread in the market literature \u2014 Menger, Mises, Rothbard, Hayek \u2014 I realized that they never said this precisely. What they said is that money emerges from exchange involving goods with use value. It didn\u2019t have to be barter, and it didn\u2019t have to be physical goods. The source of value emerged from people actually using something, and that can be a good or a service. \n\u201cThis is where it clicked for me. The Blockchain has enormous use value.\u201d \nOnce that became obvious, the monetary marker that caused the Blockchain to work \u2014 namely Bitcoin \u2014 became the expression of that value, and hence money. \nFurther, I found that all these thinkers had anticipated that moneyness doesn\u2019t happen overnight. It comes about gradually through entrepreneurial experience. Something can work as money in one place but not in another, for some transactions but not for all. This is precisely the experience of Bitcoin. It is following the same path as every other money in history. It is not different in that sense. Bitcoin brings the efficiency of advanced technology to one of the world\u2019s oldest institutions.\nBC: In your book Bit by Bit: How P2P is Freeing the World, you describe commercial transactions as literal acts of love. Explain.\nJT: Love is the coming together of two people with volition and intention, and the results of love are always greater than the sum of the parts that go into creating it. The value of each is multiplied in the cooperation of spirits.\n\n\u201cIf one person defects, the love ends. It is the same with trade. We own. We exchange. The results are that each person is better off.\u201d\n\nBut in order to realize this enhanced state of being, you have to have the volition of each party engaged. That\u2019s when the magic takes place. Even though nothing in the physical world has changed, you enter into a new state of mind where a new level of valuation exists. That\u2019s a very beautiful thing, and the least appreciated merit of an exchange economy.\nBC: Some have likened Bitcoin to a gun \u2013 a tool that\u2019s just as useful for doing evil as doing good. Do you think this comparison is accurate? Why or why not?\nJT: I suppose the same can be said of knives, rope, or bricks. It\u2019s a bit of a trivial point. The main thing is that we need a monetary technology always. And we need one that is keeping up with technological trends. Our national monies are extremely old fashioned, having been nationalized for 100 years, while our payment systems are half a century out of date. This is unsustainable. Bitcoin has been invented and won\u2019t be uninvented. It is on an inexorable march toward mainstream acceptance.\nBC: You seem to agree with Roger Ver that large modern wars have been the direct result of the monopolization of money by central banks. But many disagree that privatized money like Bitcoin will do anything to prevent wars. Why are they wrong?\nJT: If Bitcoin is to prevent wars, a number of things need to happen. National monies will have to give up their near universal use and surrender to cryptocurrencies. I can see this happening but that future is way down the road. National monies will not entirely disappear of course, not under any scenario. They will always be used for taxes, always be spent by governments. But reduced circulation of the dollar does make it less effective as a tool for funding large-scale spending programs via inflation. And let me say this too: \n\u201cthere is no question that central banking and total war are linked.\u201d\nBC: Bitcoin is in the larger category of distributed networks, which your book describes in detail. How do you see the world changing in light of the advent of the distributed network?\nJT: Distributed networks change so much, perhaps everything. As capital, it is not owned by any one institution, which is amazing. And yet it puts massive economic power into the hands of the individual. The great economic debate really came down to: which is worse, big government or big corporations? That\u2019s a terrible way to frame the debate but we weren\u2019t able to avoid it. Maybe that won\u2019t be the main question in the future. Maybe the question will be: which is better, universal and distributed capital or centralized institutions of all sorts? We can win this one. It changes the political dynamic. \n\u201cSuddenly everyone has so much to lose from the continuation of monopolization policies.\u201d\nBC: For those who\u2019d like to understand more of the sound money and property rights theories (i.e. Austrian) as they apply to cryptocurrency, what further reading do you recommend?\nJT: I would strongly suggest F.A. Hayek\u2019s Denationalization of Money from 1974. I think that\u2019s the best. Satoshi\u2019s White Paper should be reread every few months. Then I would recommend Murray Rothbard\u2019s What Has Government Done to Our Money?\n\nTucker is the founder of \u201cthe global liberty community,\u201d Liberty.me (which accepts Bitcoin for membership), as well as Director of Digital Development Foundation for Economic Education (FEE).\nWere you skeptical when you first heard of cryptocurrency?

After years of mockery and ignorance about Bitcoin and anything related, 2015 has proven to be a lengthy procession of plaudits for Bitcoin\u2019s foundation, the ledger know as the blockchain. Being a former banker myself, I marvel at the double-talk lobbied by mainstream economic leaders like Jamie Dimon of J.P. Morgan Chase, but maybe I shouldn\u2019t be so surprised at all.\nAlso read: Why Coding Diversity Can be Beneficial to Bitcoin Development\nDimon made headlines last week on one hand saying the banking industry may see value in using Bitcoin\u2019s Blockchain technology, but out of the other side of his mouth, vehemently deriding the digital currency of Bitcoin. He went so far as to say \u201cBitcoin will be stopped!\u201d He was even incredulous in his hubris, shocked that this was still a question worthy of posing to an economic elitist like himself. If he doesn\u2019t use it, or understand it, why should it exist? If it doesn\u2019t help him, or his centralized bank, it must be worthless on this planet. Next question.\nAs much as Dimon and the rest of the financial establishment hate to admit it, they were wrong about Bitcoin\u2019s technology three years ago not being relevant. They are wrong today about Bitcoin being a non-starter because Bitcoin has a strong foundation. So strong in fact that the banking industry is looking into using Bitcoin\u2019s foundation because its far better than their own. Bankers are wrong an awful lot; I\u2019ve learned over the years because they only care about their accountability to the stockholders, not ethics or innovative new technologies.\nBanks and other major investors are having no problem throwing money at Bitcoin technology, easily setting a record in capital investment already in 2015. Today, I\u2019m going to update you on a couple of benchmarks that should add many brighter days to \u201cThe Future of Money.\u201d One is obvious, and one more insidious to our mainstream economic brothers, which may tilt things in Bitcoin\u2019s favor. Many in western society see Bitcoin as a high-risk, high-yield investment and won\u2019t accept it as anything more than that. Fine. That is a very narrow scope, from the very narrow-minded, but Bitcoin has something for everybody, so let\u2019s look at its future investment value potential going forward. 2015 was \u201cThe Year of the Blockchain\u201d. I believe 2016 will be \u201cThe Year of Bitcoin.\u201d Here\u2019s why.\nBitcoin has Been Trending Upward all Year\n\n2013 was an incredible year of growth in value, and mainstream attention built on\u00a0the back of a bubble created by Mt Gox \u201cBilly-bots\u201d and the desire of mainland Chinese flooding into the market in demand unabated at least initially. Bitcoin USD values rose from $13 at the start of 2013 to almost $800 by year\u2019s end.\u00a0Logic dictated that this level of growth couldn\u2019t continue, and needed correction, and that was where 2014 came in. The correction didn\u2019t stop until mid-January of 2015, when prices fell to less than $180 USD.\nFunny thing is, this value was still about 35% of where the bubble started in the Fall of 2013, a great sign of inherent market value. Things have been on the upswing ever since. That is the first reason for optimism. Everybody who was in it from the beginning, for the long run, were still ahead after all was said and done. The day traders got burned, but I say\u2026..sweet! Who needs more day traders? Hopefully, the STPers, the Short Term Players, have moved on.\nBitcoin Halving\nAnother positive sign up ahead that will be a boon is the halving of Bitcoin production in the Summer of 2016. Anyone with 5th-grade levels of economic understanding will agree that when you cut production or availability of an asset in half going forward, the economic value of that asset must go up in the future if all other things remain equal. With Bitcoin acceptance, transactions and ownership only showing consistent growth over the last five years, there is no reason to foresee a drop in demand between now and then. Even the most ardent haters and trolls will admit that much after six-plus years of data. Will miners have to sell more BTC to keep the lights on following the reduction of rewards? Yes, and Bitcoin won\u2019t double in price because of the halving like many believe, but the net effect on Bitcoin price values, if this is what floats your boat, is a positive net gain heading into 2017.\nBitcoin has built a solid foundation of adopters who are spreading the word across the globe. Nation-states are attracting more attention to Bitcoin through \u201cThe Streisand Effect\u201d by condemning Bitcoin rather than letting nature take its course. The more people hear about Bitcoin versus common fiat currencies, the more people see the intrinsic value of a fully digital currency not directly governed by any centralized force. Bitcoin is in the right place at the right time. The only real question is how far does this rocket go upward? Governments like Russia working against it seem only strong enough to create black markets locally, and move mainstream adoption to more freedom-based locales. Bitcoin is not designed to be directly assaulted by centralized interests. It is designed to move around their primitive blockades.\nNation-States and Fiat Currencies Worldwide Struggle to Stay Afloat\nSo the coming future halving of Bitcoin production is going to be a boon to the overall value of each unit of measure. And an even greater catalyst looms in relation to the issues of the rash of failing national fiat currency markets, which is Factor #3. Many financial experts in the West understand that the U.S. Dollar as the global reserve currency is in peril in the not-to-distant future. The fiat economies of the world are falling like dominoes, burning into ashes around Bitcoin\u2019s intrepid strength and resilience in the currency markets. The only question is who\u2019s next to collapse under the weight of their own debt-based system?\nThe E.U. (The European Union) and it\u2019s Euro has been quite an impressive failure, at least as far as currency value and employment stability in the affiliated countries is concerned. Italy is dealing with unemployment levels for people 15-24 years of age at well over 40%. Greece has seen major economic collapse, forcing a series of handouts. Cyprus was a \u201cbeta test\u201d for a future of worldwide \u201cbank bail-ins,\u201d where it is deemed legal by the government to allow bank deposits to be raided by insolvent institutions at a rate of 50% of deposits held. Stealing from the citizenry is done for \u201cThe greater good.\u201d If banks collapse, they might have to pay for their incompetence and unethical business practices, and we can\u2019t have that, now can we? The people are starting to catch onto this scam and are taking their economic future into their own hands. The wheels of justice move slowly, but they are moving in Bitcoin\u2019s favor.\nDuring the beta test for this criminal act made legal, when Cyprus bank depositors were ripped off to protect the wealthy, Gold prices in March of 2013 were hardly affected. Bitcoin price rose from less than $20 March 1st to over $135 at the end of March, an almost 700% increase in USD Bitcoin price. Those locals affected headed for cover into the emerging Bitcoin market. Considering the fact that a mere $500 million Bitcoin market, at the time, is easily swayed by a swift influx of new money, it\u2019s not hard to understand the explosion in value. So consider that a warning shot of what is to come. Beta test: Successful.\nThe more recent bank run and \u201crecapitalization plan\u201d in Greece didn\u2019t affect Bitcoin value to the same degree, but brought it into the global economic conversation. You know what they say. There\u2019s no such thing as bad publicity. Due to fractional reserve banking, banks don\u2019t hold more than 10% of their asset ledger on hand, so once things turned south, it wasn\u2019t long before the banks were locked down. This beta test was also a success, since they have the consumers\u2019 money under control, and can dole it out at their discretion. Power is nothing without control, and the bankers doubled-down on both. It was a win-win for the banking industry and the people who trusted bankers lost. Again. It was just business. Nothing personal.\nPeople Complain About Bitcoin\u2019s Volatility Upward? Would you like the Opposite?\nIf these were isolated incidents, a Bitcoin critic could explain them away, but look at the Argentinian Peso (inflation at 30% a month), the Zimbabwe Dollar (inflation into oblivion) or the Russian Ruble (Lost 50% of its value last year.) This is a trend of fiat default, to anyone paying attention. If that isn\u2019t a hint and a half that long-term rule of debt-based fiat currencies are on their last legs, nothing is. As currencies around the world stumble and fall, more and more money flows out of the tried-and-failed fiat system and into \u201cThe Future of Money,\u201d\u00a0as we\u2019ve covered here previously.\nThe governments and private banking interests they are beholden to are daring you to move your money out of E.U. banks into anything else. They don\u2019t think you have any other choices but to bend over and take what new levels of corruption they give to you. That\u2019s where Bitcoin steps onto the stage, the right asset at the right time in history. Just like the Internet before it, Bitcoin is ready to disrupt and permanently change a financial industry that needs dramatic disruption and change. If logic doesn\u2019t bring a higher level of adoption, the need to protect one\u2019s wealth will.\nMoney is Flowing into Bitcoin at Record Levels\nFinally, all of this record-setting venture capital investment being invested into the Bitcoin and blockchain space is coming out in 2016 and beyond. New technologies, new websites, blockchain apps, and business ventures that will only grow the Bitcoin community from the inside out. Purse.io, OpenBazaar, CryptList.org and many other exciting new business ventures are only going to raise the profile of the Bitcoin community.\nThere are thousands of developers, designers, and business owners working around the world in new jobs that didn\u2019t exist a year ago, all working to make Bitcoin better every day. We\u2019ve seen this before, twenty years ago, with the market explosion of the Internet. History is repeating itself, as we speak. Many of them have left legacy banking positions to join this economic revolution. The world\u2019s best and brightest minds are getting attracted the Bitcoin like moths to a flame.\nSelf-defeating government action, financial institutional arrogance, and new Bitcoin businesses opening and innovating worldwide equals potential exponential growth for Bitcoin in the near future. Bitcoin is up almost 100% from its end-of-bubble 2015 low point back in January. Bitcoin again is trending upward heading into 2016. I\u2019ll take the upward volatility of Bitcoin over the depreciating deceit of the current economic masters and their funny money any day. If you have the heart to be a long-term player in Bitcoin, you will reap the rewards. Are you in?\nWhat do you think this future mega bail-in means for the E.U., for the Bitcoin price, and for the future of fiat currency vs. Digital currency?

Shouldn\u2019t sending an employee paycheck, in Bitcoins, be just as easy as sending payment via QR code? Fast, easy and as smooth as a swipe of your seven-inch screen, BitWage thinks so too. This week they\u2019ve introduced the world to they first smartphone app for business payroll payments dealing in Bitcoin.\nAlso read: Free Keene\u2019s Bitcoin Vending Machine Anniversary\nBitwage has offered several innovations over the last year, from their Cloud Savings to their Bitwage Debit Card. Now with their mobile app, you can check the status of your payroll while on the go, or simply move funds between the Cloud Savings, Debit card and payroll easily. Enter an amount, and you can be in gold, US Dollars or BTC within seconds.\nThose who are BitWage customers give themselves the freedom to kick their bank, and remove their fees and lead times altogether according to BitWage President Jonathan Chester, who spoke to bitcoin.com about this new program.\n\u201cWe have done over $1.5m in transactions since our Bitcoin Payroll for the Individual was released last November. Over the next year, we want to change the relationship people have with their payroll. This is part of a full, end to end, payroll solution. Employers will be paying employees in countries all over the world as quick and easy as sending a text message. The employees on the other side hold their funds, unrestricted by the fees and delays of the banks, and access local currency on the fly, all managed by our single app.\u201d\nChester\u2019s team at BitWage uses the latest Authy or Google Authenticator for Two-Factor Authentication to protect users. Once you have logged in and set up your PIN, you\u2019re ready to go. To get the Bitwage Android App, go to the Google App store, search \u201cBitwage,\u201d and download.\nThe end goal is to remove the need for central banking and leverage the advances of Blockchain technology to simplify business payroll and payments.

Banks can be cut out, and one can now live 100% completely on Bitcoin, as long as your local retailers accept Bitcoin or Bitwage Debit cards.\nWant to get paid in precious metals like Gold or Silver?

{"url": "https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-psychedelic-drug/", "title": "How Bitcoin is like a Psychedelic Drug", "content": "\n\n\n\n\t            How Bitcoin is like a Psychedelic Drug            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsychedelic drugs ferociously alter consciousness; LSD and Mushrooms are known to do this. They cause a person to experience a gamut of internal changes and perceptions. The person becomes a psychonaut, searching the depths of their unconscious terrain. During this exploration, they experience unity with nature, and their boundaries are ultimately dissolved. This allows them to connect with fellow humans and relate to them in ways previously unconsidered.\nAlso read: How Bitcoin Can Alter Our Psychology\nPsychedelic\u00a0literally means mind-manifesting, which implies that\u00a0a person can examine and fully explore their minds. The experience can then\u00a0stretch for what feels like an eternity\u00a0as they undergo\u00a0wonderment and bliss. They may even discover something novel\u00a0or profound about themselves. This aspect of the experience is referred to by Zen monks as Satori: the flash of insight.\nBitcoin, amazingly, is a psychedelic drug of sorts.\nBitcoin\u00a0is a\u00a0mind-manifesting experience. It deeply alters the psyche, and also causes intense insight. It is immaterial money put into focus by the human mind. It is cyberspace fashioned\u00a0for practical use via code and algorithm; it is\u00a0mind turned\u00a0to the will. Through\u00a0Bitcoin, the boundaries of finance and economics are dissolved. It is the ultimate psychedelic expression, intended\u00a0to meet humanity\u2019s needs and desires for economic self-fulfillment.\nThe digital currency is borderless\u00a0like\u00a0the psychedelic experience. It is sprawling and immersive. Bitcoin can navigate its way over any geography, across water or land, and bypass any government-controlled checkpoint. While on mind-manifesting drugs, a person undergoes the sharing of consciousness with others, transferring\u00a0memories, dreams, fantasies, thoughts and emotions. People essentially open-source each others\u2019 minds, and engage in true peer-2-peer intimacy. Bitcoin hijacked this property. It is open-source and peer-2-peer for all\u00a0to experience, as people can share and alter it in a myriad of ways, for an ongoing and unending sublime creation; it is the true the democratization of money.\nBitcoin is also decentralized, which is a primary characteristic of the psychedelic experience. Once boundaries are dissolved, the individual soul becomes decentralized as well. Bitcoin takes advantage of this fact, and dissolves all boundaries regarding\u00a0how money should be perceived and defined. Therefore, bitcoin represents\u00a0the start of mind-manifesting finance.\nThese truths contain\u00a0many\u00a0implications.\nIn my previous article, I mentioned that money is like a drug. Fiat money resembles cocaine. It amps\u00a0a person up, makes them feel invincible, yet they also get aggressive and mad; and when they come down, spent, they start feeling depressed and anxious. This would make fiat currency a destructive\u00a0and horrible drug, something people should stay away from.\nOn the other side of the medallion, Bitcoin is more like the psychedelic of currency, maybe like magic mushrooms. The come up is exciting and it intensifies quickly. The peak experience blows the mind and causes a multitude of sensations and perceptions, many of them positive. And there is relatively no come down, just an afterglow of unimaginable awe. Bitcoin personifies this awe in digital form, and it is not so terribly addicting as to cause abuse and self-destructiveness. Sometimes, the psychedelic voyager may experience terror, but when something is so new and strange, it is likely to cause brief episodes of intense fear and confusion, before being acclimated by the psyche.\nIf we can make use of this metaphor, the implication means increasing\u00a0Bitcoin adoption and acceptance. It means dispensing\u00a0with this idea that money is evil; that its only use is to motivate the greedy and selfish. As Andreas Antonopoulos\u00a0said,\n\u201cBitcoin is money, but it is so much more than that.\u201d\nAntonopoulos is obviously right. Bitcoin is so more than money. It is an experience, a celebration of humanity\u2019s determination\u00a0to strive for innovation in every aspect of life, to turn the physical into mental. It\u00a0is a testament to where we are going. It is psychedelic in a purely symbolic sense, because it has the power to change and expand minds. Bitcoin as a\u00a0technology is an\u00a0exhalation of what it means to be human. It is absolutely amazing, and will lift\u00a0innovation to towering new heights, as will any blockchain based technology to come.\nDo you think that the psychedelic and drug analogy can be useful for spurring more bitcoin adoption, especially from other subcultures or countercultures?

{"url": "https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-price-rising-bitcoin-sales-double-2014/", "title": "Bitcoin Global Purchase Volume Doubles in 2015", "content": "\n\n\n\n\t            Bitcoin Global Purchase Volume Doubles in 2015            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany are looking at recent Bitcoin price increases and are looking for a cause-and-effect. Scams by Russians in China, corporate capital investment at an all time high, and Chinese capital controls are commonly mentioned triggers. One highly probable factor is the simple increase in purchase volume worldwide, according to the Bitcoin sales tracking website Coin.dance.\nAlso read: Changing the Blockchain PR Image for Average Consumers\nCoin.dance charts the weekly sales of popular Bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins.com, which specializes in face-to-face Bitcoin sales, as well as online Bitcoin purchases. Their data shows Bitcoin sales are up tremendously in 2015, both worldwide and in most major countries, over the previous two years. For example, global Bitcoin sales over this time last year have more than doubled, as indicated by the chart below.\n\nSales have expanded from about 15,000 BTC sales a week in October of 2014 to over 35,000 BTC last month. The website breaks down LocalBitcoins.com sales in every major country, and it shows very interesting growth patterns that vary from region to region. As you might expect, China is an area of explosive growth for Bitcoin sales on the site, rising hundreds of percent from one year ago until now. The only problem is a Chinese Yuan is not worth very much in relation to U.S. Dollars (A Chinese Yuan is worth about $0.16 USD)\nAn interesting country, but potentially very important to Bitcoin\u2019s future, is India. The second largest country in the world based on population, India is normally trading 2-3 million Indian Rupees per week in Bitcoin. Oddly, Indian Rupee trade volume spiked to over 11 million rupees for just one week, the week of 10/31/15, coinciding with the global Bitcoin price spike. The only problem is 11 million Indian Rupees are worth less than $200k USD (One Rupee is worth about $0.015 USD, or one-tenth of the Chinese Yuan mentioned above). Countries like South Africa, Russia and Venezuela also have shown impressive investment in recent weeks.\nSo a rash of recent purchase volume may indeed be an underlying cause, but the news is not all peaches and cream. Coin.dance shows that markets like the continent of Europe show no real growth year-to-year concerning Bitcoin purchases on the site in Euros. With many currency problems plaguing European countries, this may be surprising to some. Canada also shows little or no gains.\nThe United States has shown steady growth, moving an all-time high of about $7 million through this one exchange for the week of last two weeks, a jump of around 20% over earlier in October. Given the strength of the U.S. Dollar currently, compared to other fiat currencies, if other exchanges are showing similar upward mobility in volume, this may account for some market shifts.\n\nAgain, this is just one exchange out of several, so this should be viewed as an indicator, but not the definitive reason for any market changes. This site is extensive, marking the movement of over 35 national markets, plus the global chart above. The one overriding theme you get from Coin.dance\u2019s information is that 2015 is clearly a year of growth in Bitcoin interest, as far as consumer investment is concerned. Many fiat currencies are very weak, and many countries are just getting started with Bitcoin, but the trend is very positive worldwide. That can\u2019t be ignored in the current price of Bitcoin, or by the mainstream, any longer.\nWhat do you think caused the spike in Bitcoin price recently?

{"url": "https://news.bitcoin.com/how-dash-increased-node-count-by-40-in-4-months/", "title": "How Dash Increased Its Node Count by 40% in 4 Months", "content": "\n\n\n\n\t            How Dash Increased Its Node Count by 40% in 4 Months            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn June of 2015, the cryptocurrency Dash had approximately 2,500 nodes. The network then rolled out a new user role which they call the \u201cmasternode,\u201d and began paying masternodes half of the block reward (same as the miners). In the last four months, the Dash network has added almost 1,000 nodes, increasing its count by 40% for a total today of over 3300.\nSee also: What Makes a Bitcoin Company Successful?\nDash\u2019s 3300 masternodes are tasked with more than hosting its blockchain. They also perform two of Dash\u2019s key functions, namely DarkSend (a native coinjoin) and InstantX (instant transaction confirmations). They also must provide a collateral of 1000 Dash \u2013 worth about $2,500 USD \u2014 that is locked for the amount of time they act as masternodes. Currently masternodes earn an average of 0.47 Dash per day \u2014 $1.25 USD at today\u2019s price.\nLead developer and creator of the masternode scheme Evan Duffield implemented the collateral requirement for two reasons: first, to attempt to stabilize the Dash price by disincentivizing short sells; and second, to make a \u201c51% attack\u201d cost-prohibitive for a malicious actor.\nBitcoin.com spoke with Duffield to learn more about the results of Dash\u2019s masternode implementation.\n\nBitcoin.com (BC): What gave you the idea to create Masternodes?\nEvan Duffield presenting at Bitcoin Wednesday\nEvan Duffield (ED): Early on in the history of Dash I was trying to figure out a way to implement a decentralized mixer in a peer-to-peer network and thought of adding a second tier. The idea was that nodes within this second network could host sessions to improve the privacy of the blockchain.\nBC: What other options crossed your mind as possible incentive structures for nodes?\nED: I thought about a fee structure for the mixer, where users would pay the nodes they mixed on. This would have worked for the mixer, but we wouldn\u2019t have created an infrastructure with thousands of nodes to utilize for other network services as well.\nBC: Dash is the only PoW coin incentivizing nodes, I believe. Are any PoS coins incentivizing nodes, or does the problem not cross over into the PoS realm?\nED: The incentive problem for infrastructure applies to all cryptographic coins. Either a centralized company must provide the infrastructure (e.g. Ripple) or the infrastructure is voluntarily run by community members. The first solution is obviously centralized and the later will eventually fail under its own weight as the network begins to gain traction.\nDash node count since November 2014\nBC: What was the general reaction from Dash\u2019s miners about the implementation of masternodes?\nED: From what I have heard, the miners are supportive of the idea of masternodes. They would rather make less money and have a healthy ecosystem and stable foundation for growth.\n\nDash\u2019s market cap is only US$15 million \u2013 less than 0.5% of Bitcoin\u2019s US$4.7 billion. But Dash runs more than 60 % as many nodes as Bitcoin, which is running on 5300 to date.\nDuffield and the rest of the Dash team are currently preparing to roll out what they\u2019re calling the \u201cworld\u2019s first DAPI\u201d: a Decentralized Application Programming Interface. They hope the DAPI will be useful to companies and developers who want to have full access to Dash\u2019s blockchain data without having to run a node themselves.\nWhat do you think about nodes and incentives?

Don\u2019t worry \u2014 you will be provided with a short TOP 3 list of best places to attend in Ukraine while travelling.\nAlso read: Economics Nobel Prize Winner Angus Deaton and the Case for Bitcoin\n \nHow to Exchange Bitcoins to Local Currency\nIn Ukraine, there are no strict laws about using Bitcoin \u2014 authorities seem to be indifferent. However, if you use cryptocurrencies, there is no guarantee that you will receive help from the police if somebody steals your coins. So, when visiting any country with no clear government position on digital currency, you need to find safe ways of selling or buying bitcoins.\nBitcoin Exchanges\nThere are many bitcoin exchanges in Ukraine. Here\u00a0are\u00a0my personal TOP 3 Ukrainian Bitcoin exchanges. These exchanges\u00a0are worth using, with almost 100% security. For all the other exchanges, use at your own risk.\ne-btc.com.ua\nThis exchange is ultra fast and solid. It allows you to create a personal account with no personal data needed. You can exchange your bitcoins and BTC-E-USD codes to hryvnia; While your request is being\u00a0processed, you can track it in your profile. \n\nUsually, the exchange works in automatic mode. You will get money in 2 to 20 minutes on your debit or credit card. This exchange is the fastest in the whole country at the\u00a0moment. \nWhen selling bitcoins, you type in your card number (0% fee when using PrivatBank card) \u2014 no other information is needed. This exchange has received lots of\u00a0good feedback\u00a0on Russian Bitcoin forums.\nLets see, how can you buy or sell bitcoins here. First \u2014 create an account:\n\nSecond, enter your email, password, and confirm your password:\n\nAfter your account is set up, you can hit the lower right button to sell coins:\n\nType in the amount of bitcoins in dollars, and lookat \u00a0how much money it shows in UAH (\u0433\u0440\u043d.) and bitcoin. \n\nThen click the\u00a0large blue button, and you will get an address for a transaction ( the amount of coins to be sent is in bold):\n\nWhen buying bitcoins, you simply push the lower left button on the main page, which brings up a different menu.\nHere:\n\n\nYou enter the amount in dollars into the 1st field\nEnter your wallet address (or your standard will be used)\nChoose your method of payment: Privat card (0%); other card (3%); Liqpay (0%);\nHit the blue button\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s all, you\u2019ll be prompted to pay via Liqpay or PrivatBank card:\n\nIf you choose Liqpay, then youll have to walk to a bank terminal and make a payment to your special temporary Liqpay address. If you choose Privat, you\u2019ll have to deal with your local bank\u2019s online service.\nBTCU.biz\nThis exchange has worked for more than 3 years, and has a very good reputation. It uses mobile terminals for selling bitcoins. If you need to sell bitcoins with this exchange, the transaction to your card will take 2 to 6 hours. Although\u00a0you\u2019ll need to wait for a long time, you will probably get\u00a0the best bitcoin\u00a0price offer here. \nFortunately, they have an English version of their\u00a0site, so it won\u2019t be a big problem for you or your local friend to exchange coins. \nLocalBitcoins.com\nYep, you can use good old LocalBitcoins, but you will probably lose some money on seller\u2019s fees. LocalBitcoins is a valuable tool when you are arriving at Kyiv and are in need of\u00a0cash. In other cases, use exchanges and local banks, or ask your friends to help you while travelling.\nBetter Bitcoin Price\nBitcoin price matters, and every day it may be a little bit different. If you want to get\u00a0the best offer, you need to compare exchanges. But remember: the faster you get the order done, the more you will have to pay for this speed. In general, all mentioned exchanges work\u00a0fine and have adequate pricing. You may use any, depending on how fast you want the transaction to be completed. Also, if you have a really big volume of bitcoins to exchange, say, 30 BTC, then I strongly advise to use all of them by giving each 1/3 of the sum. \nWhere to go?\nYou definitely don\u2019t want to go to the Donetsk or Lugansk regions, or Crimea. Local political affairs are\u00a0ongoing there. Instead, it is better to visit the\u00a0western part of the country, Kyiv and Odessa.\nThe Ukrainian capital is always a cool place to visit. You can meet the strangest people in the\u00a0country on its streets. Plan your trip to Kyiv and enjoy its eastern Europe atmosphere.\nYou can also go to Odessa, a capital of humour, and dive into its night life.\n\nThere are many notable castles in Western Ukraine. See, for example, Podgoreckii Zamok, situated near Lviv, in Podgorcy village. Search for amazing places all over Karpaty and make some notes.\nThe\u00a0city of Lviv would be the\u00a0best choice to start or end your travels, depending on how much chocolate and really good coffee you want at the beginning or the end. I\u2019ve never been to Lviv, but the only coffee on Ukrainian market I can buy is Coffee from Lviv \u2014 it tastes much better than any foreign coffee, even the contraband ones.\nLook on the web and choose what place interests you. I\u2019ve searched several English-language tourist websites made by local English copywriters, and they seem to be pretty relevant.\nHave you ever traveled to Ukraine?

{"url": "https://news.bitcoin.com/parlay-phone-app-challenge-friends-wager-bitcoin/", "title": "Parlay: Phone App to Challenge Friends and Wager Bitcoin", "content": "\n\n\n\n\t            Parlay: Phone App to Challenge Friends and Wager Bitcoin            \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA pair of San Francisco-based siblings have just released Parlay, a smartphone app that\u00a0enables users to \u201cchallenge\u201d their friends and wager on the outcome. The siblings are sister Sidney Sands-Ramshaw \u2014 a betting maven and former analyst \u2014 and brother Loren Sands-Ramshaw, a coder and former NSA security engineer.\nAlso read: The Role of Bitcoin in Mobile E-Commerce\nExample of friend-to-friend challenge and $50 wager in BTC\n\u201cI will beat you in Minecraft this weekend,\u201d is an example of a challenge on Parlay app. The challenged friend can then choose to accept the parlay and pick a wagered item: a \u201cdefeat\u201d pic, a charitable donation or money.\nThe \u201cdefeat pic\u201d wager? The loser must submit a sad selfie after their moment of defeat. If \u201ccharity\u201d was chosen, wagered money is donated to an organization like Watsi, Girls Who Code, or charity: water. And if the wager is just good ol\u2019 fashioned money, the winner takes all\u2013the Bitcoin, that is. The loser is not compelled to pay up by the app\u2013he could technically choose not to. But as the Sands-Ramshaws say, no one would want to do that \u201c\u2019cause, you know, respect. . .\u201d\nParlays between your friends are also viewable within the app, so the user can see which challenges are happening within his or her circle. The user\u00a0can even comment on others\u2019 challenges to up the rivalry factor.\nBitcoin.com caught up with Sidney and Loren to inquire about the duo\u2019s inspiration, goals, and crypto educations.\n\n\u00a0\nBitcoin.com (BC): What gave you the idea for the Parlay app?\nSidney Sands-Ramshaw (SSR): I bet with my friends, co-workers, and family a lot. I started hacking together a mix of Google calendar invites and Venmo requests to keep track of all my different challenges, but I wanted a better way and thought: there has to be an app for that! But, there wasn\u2019t. So, we made one.\nBC: Where did the name \u201cParlay\u201d come from? I\u2019ve only ever heard it on the movie \u201cPirates of the Caribbean.\u201d\nCEO of Parlay app\nSSR: \u201cParlay\u201d also means to take something and turn it into something with greater value. The term is often used in reference to money, but can also be used in reference to situations, and we liked its connotations. However, if people aren\u2019t familiar with that meaning and associate us with Keira Knightley instead, we don\u2019t really mind. She\u2019s badass.\nBC: Have you two worked together on projects before, or is this the first time?\nSSR: This is our first time working together professionally. We are very different people with different interests, resulting in complementary skills and a great deal of mutual respect. Thankfully, sibling rivalry has never really been a thing for us because then I would have to learn to code really, really well, which would be hard and time consuming.\nBC: Did you test the app on your friends? Do you use it yourselves?\nSSR: We did and we do! One of the most fun things about building a project is studying how other people use it and comparing that to how you use it, or thought they would use it. Doing that with friends is easier because they normally feel obligated to answer all your questions. I think it\u2019s fair to say we use it for goal-setting and motivational challenges most with each other. It has become a fun way to get one another to do things.\nBC: What was your first exposure to Bitcoin?\nCTO of Parlay app\nLoren Sands-Ramshaw (LSR): I have been reading The Hacker News for years, so I probably first heard of it there a while back. I believe it\u2019s the future of money transfer (among other things), and hope to introduce more people to it through a popular app.\nBC: Might Parlay accept any other cryptocurrencies in the future? Any particular ones you like aside from Bitcoin?\nLSR: We\u2019re trying to keep the app simple, and there are many other apps that allow you to quickly exchange other currencies for BTC, so we don\u2019t have any current plans for adding other cryptocurrencies to Parlay. Certainly if any other currency comes to rival Bitcoin in market adoption, then we would consider it. In terms of what we like, we\u2019re hopeful about Stellar.\n\nThe Sands-Ramshaws have seemingly built the app that they most wanted for themselves: an easier way to make bets among family and close friends. Parlay is currently available in the Google Play and iOS app stores.\nSome say that if gambling isn\u2019t Bitcoin\u2019s \u201ckiller app,\u201d that it\u2019s a close second. What do you think?

A small but professional TV production studio, Speaking and Showing, claimed to be working on the first Russian documentary film about digital currencies. The studio posted a call for help on bitnovosti.com, aRussian-language news magazine. On October 11, 2015, a mysterious well-wisher sent 27 BTC to the film\u2019s official crowdfunding address. Thus, Speaking and Showing\u2019s crowdfunding goal of 30 BTC has been reached. \nAlso read: Bitcoin.com Wiki: Earn Money by Educating the Masses\nSpeaking and Showing has created an absolutely unique and educative piece, titled \u201cCryptocurrencies. The Gold of the Cyberage.\u201d But, while working with Russian federal channels, the studio faced some serious troubles, leading it to ask the community for help.\nWho is the Mysterious Supporter?\nA mysterious supporter from Russian Bitcoin community made a donation of 27 BTC to the film\u2019s official Bitcoin address. He also left a comment under the last article on a site which inspired him to make a donation. The generous donor, with the nickname \u201c1111112222\u201d said,\njust sent the missing 27 bitcoins\nHe also wrote:\n\u201cI hope this will help the development and adoption of Bitcoin. From one side, it is a pity, and from another \u2013 I thinked, who else if not me?) It is necessary to help somehow, especially while having an opportunity to do so\u201d\nIn a recent article, Bitnovosti.com spoke to Alexander Bezzubtsev, chief producer of Speaking and Showing, to find out more details about the film. He gave a brilliant interview, explaining that it\u2019s not so simple to work as an independent video crew in the modern Russian TV space. Bezzubtsev also shared some exclusive information about video producing. Looks like the angle of an article convinced someone dramatically to finish the crowdfunding campaign with one shot before its release. Let us remind that this documentary will be the first film in Bitcoin history that is fully produced and released only for bitcoins. At the moment of 27 bitcoins transaction is made, address contained at about 3.4 bitcoins \u2014 all of them donations from the community.\nA Call for Help is Heard\nWe asked Alexander about his thoughts of the recently transaction and charitable person behind it. The producer says proudly,\n\u201cYes! And they sent SMS about money transferring. They still dont answer my question about who must be named in credits\u2026This is so unexpected, Im worrying. We will start doing the translation and preparing the film for its Internet release. I think, the release will happen in about a week\u201d\nSo, the Russian-speaking Internet and TV audience is about to receive a present it wont forget \u2014 ever. An educative film, made by professionals, for a wide audience \u2014 what could be more of\u00a0a potential adoption boom? Let\u2019s hope this film will continue its\u00a0road to the festivals and international premiers. Remember everyone, in Bitcoin community, someone will always help you.\nSpeaking and Showing proved that in the Bitcoin community, someone will always help you. The studio contacted several people from Bitcoin community for\u00a0help, and got it in the\u00a0form of donations and the efforts of many community\u00a0members. Producers wish to thank:\n\nRoger Ver, for his wise advice and valuable help in obtaining all rights for the film.\nMysterious well-wisher, who gave his 27 bitcoins to support documentaries and cryptocurrencies and earned a heavy portion of total respect from the Russian-speaking community.\nThe Bitnovosti crew and all the people who helped in the film\u2019s preparation\n\nVGTRK Refuse to Air the Film\nWhen the film was almost done, the VGTRK channel said that the documentary would not be aired.\n\u201cIn April, 2015, VGTRK said they refuse to air the film because it is not actual anymore\u2026 Agree with me, this is so funny! \u2013 says Bezzubtsev\u201d\nThis kind of authoritative\u00a0prevention of\u00a0spreading new and valuable material to ordinary citizens is actually common to Russia, but filmmakers were disappointed and shocked to receive this news.\n\u201cUnfortunately, in a field of documentary movies in Russia main criteria for filmmaker to be picked by TV company is not novelty or quality of video content, but loyalty to channel politics\u201d\nMore about\u00a0Speaking and Showing\n\u00a0\nSpeaking and Showing has worked on professional documentaries since 2009. The studio has over 300 works in\u00a0their portfolio. Here\u2019s an example of such a movie called \u201cFollowing the steps of Ivan Susanin\u201d (2013).\nStoryline\nBezzubtsev says,\n\u201cthe scenario shows all the opinions and versions about Bitcoin. I concider this is a good point of view. If you dont give a viewer reason to think about the topic, he can suspect you in fraud\u201d\nIn general, the film explains in simple language the\u00a0current state of digital currencies and Bitcoin around the world and in Russia. It educates viewers about the nature of money, and shows them differences between Bitcoin payments and ordinary payments. The film\u00a0designed to be a perfect presentation of a new financial tool to a wide circle of post-USSR viewers. Also, some exclusive material is expected, such as an interview with Roger Ver, filmed in Moscow.\n\nThe documentary\u2019s storyline, among other secrets, contains a real story of a Russian enthusiast. He discovered\u00a0Bitcoin a long time ago and grew from a curious user to a professional miner. Filmmakers tried to show not only a generalized character of Russian bitcoin miner, but also a concrete case of a tech savvy, young, local guy who constructed his own mining farm. This farm is actually showed in the\u00a0film; it\u2019s real, it\u2019s working, and it\u2019s not just a plastic model created by studio staff.\nWould you be interested in watching this documentary?

But Charlie Shrem is also one of the first people to get involved with Bitcoin on a business level, as he founded the once popular platform BitInstant. Even federal prison can not keep Charlie Shrem from doing an AMA with the Bitcoin community, which will be of particular interest to a very large audience.\nalso read: The Great Bitcoin Halving\nAMA With Charlie Shrem Through Federal Prison Email System\nMost people residing in federal prison have limited to no access to the Internet, as they could use it to communicate to the outside world in an illegitimate manner. That being said, US federal prisons do have an email service available to inmates, albeit there are some restrictions on how it can be used.\n\nAny incoming or outgoing email sent through the federal prison email system is delayed by 90 minutes, disabling any form of real-time communication with the outside world. But that isn\u2019t keeping Charlie Shrem from keeping in touch with the Bitcoin community he values and cherishes so much though.\n\nIn fact, Charlie is planning to do an AMA over this federal prison email system, despite the lengthy delay to respond to incoming questions. Every weekday, between 1:30 PM and 3:30 PM EST, Charlie Shrem will have access to a computer connected to the email system, and answer as many questions as he possibly can.\n\nNo topic is too difficult or too troubled to ask, as this is an \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d type of recurring event. One of the most oftenly asked questions will undoubtedly be how Charlie is being treated in Bitcoin, a matter near and dear to most of the Bitcoin community. Any and all questions are more than welcome, and Charlie will do his best to reply to every single one in a timely manner [despite the minimum 3-hour delay for every single message].\nAll of the communication taking place over the federal prison email system is closely monitored by government officials, which could result in some questions being more difficult to answer than others. Furthermore, Charlie Shrem will be answering the questions by himself, and replies will be posted on the Bitcoin.com forum.\nIt will be interesting to see how long the federal prison warden and US government officials will allow these sessions to continue. This type of leniency does not occur all that often, and it should be seen as a major milestone in Bitcoin history to have Charlie Shrem being able to answer community questions, albeit indirectly. \nAll of the questions being submitted to Charlie Shrem can be posted on the brand new Bitcoin.com forum, which is the same place where the original AMA announcement was posted a little while ago. If you have not registered yet, it is a perfect time to do so.\nClick here to register.\nAre you going to ask Charlie Shrem a question through these AMA sessions? Why (not)?
