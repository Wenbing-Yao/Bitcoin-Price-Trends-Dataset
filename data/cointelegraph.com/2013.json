We are right on time to look back on the previous 12 months and to draw a line after the most determining and replete period of the life of the Bitcoin. The history has started back in the 2008, but the most terrific, important, exciting events took place this year, to engrave the year not only in IT and finance history, but surely in the chronicles of humanity, as cryptocurrencies have touched different aspects of our lives.\nThe Price of Bitcoin\nThe main topic of all conversations about and around Bitcoin has been its price. If we observe the statistics carefully and compare it with previous years, we can see that the currency has obtained its preferred price corresponding to it natural value only this year. The first fast increase has happened in April (266$) and can be reasoned with the attraction of many users and the popularization of the coin. The term became a popular search on the most engines, or, at least, was placed in the top-3 inquiries. The rather quiet summer has brought the society to a very dynamic autumn \u2013 the closing of a black market Silk Road, taking in custody of Ross Ulbricht, the owner of the platform, China changing its mind on the coin, statements and warnings from several countries around the world, new goods and services to be exchanged for virtual money have increased the price to beat gold with 1242 dollars per BTC. The current stability is surely associated with the busy holidays offering some other activities and necessities to the users, but many experts name the next year \u2013 the year of the Bitcoin among other sophisticated trends.\nSociety and Bitcoin in 2013 On the 28th of August Bitcoin received a license to live and to act \u2013 it was among other words of the update of the Oxford Dictionaries Online. It received a very humble and questionable definition: \u201ca digital currency in which transactions can be performed without the need for a central bank\u201d, but it is sufficient to enter our language and become a household name. It merely exists and cannot be disputed.\nIt seems to be a ticket or even an introduction for merchants and servicemen to consider Bitcoin as a fair payment method. This year will definitely stay in our minds as a time, when numerous products started to be available for coin users and they also have been offered discounts for the loyalty to the virtual currency.\nThe digital coin allows an activist to provide all basic necessities. Recently, on the 25th December we have published a list of the pioneers of the healthcare branch, who are ready to monitor pregnancy (Fertility Care, is located in Brea, California, the USA), challenge a mind disorder (MindSci Psychiatric in New York, the USA), care for a spread ankle (Nordorthopaedics clinic in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania) and provide all necessary actions to the pets of the online environment users (Vetco form Albuquerque, New Mexico).\nA healthy bitcoiner is also hungry. This problem was approached by many merchants \u2013 from burger stands in a district of London, to a whole chain providing fast-food. Subway sandwich outlets offer customers discounts for Bitcoin payments, becoming a global supporter of the initiative.\nIn case the user wishes to get something to please his/her soul, please, browse through numerous offers on the web, among them \u2013 music. Snoop Dogg (better say, Snoop Lion) and Mel B have voiced their wish to accept bitocin for their products \u2013 songs.\nEven, if that is not enough and someone have thousands of coins left after he or she has covered his/her basic needs the luxury world can be observed. Virgin Galactic is ready to bring You to outer space since November, Riders Borja and Elvis can take You on a ride around Africa, Lamborghini can provide You with the most efficient and green vehicle around. In case You prefer to spend lazy hours at the swimming pool or would like to purchase a collection of fine China as an add on to a mansion \u2013 just contact Las Vegas property agent to free Jack and Laura Sommer from their luxurious burden.\nAnd if something still is left, remember, receiving is as good as giving away, especially on Christmas. Sean\u2019s Outpost accepts donations of Bitcoins to provide regular dinners or even establish a place to live and work for roofless.\nLaw and Order for Bitcoin in 2013\nThis year Bitcoin has made numerous attempts to leave the underground he was pushed by natural happenings. Time was necessary for the currency to establish a particular position, to enter the financial world with the same rights as fiat currencies and to try to replace them offering more advantages than anyone else.\nAs the year has started with a rise of price, the most developed countries presented the biggest coin user communities, among them the USA, Germany, Japan and several others. The first governmental institution to recognize the necessity of regulation was FinCEN. Senate hearing was hold in early fall featuring presentation of coin entrepreneurs and investors, Inside Bitcoin Conference aimed to clarify the matters and basics of the currency, merchants tried to register their business to stay aboard the official economy. The final decision was to register all the companies accepting Bitcoin as a matter of exchange by FinCEN to avoid anti-money laundering and to provide safety to the customers.\nIt seemed that this example might be determining for other countries. The European Banking Authority has issued a warning on all cryptographic currencies, among them Bitcoin. The biggest threats are seen in the unregulated nature, price fluctuations and the impossibility to return lost funds. The EU single countries have gone a little further and their opinions were rather different. France issued a similar comment, but Germany linked the coins with the term \u201cprivate money\u201d to ensure some support of the freedom of choice of its citizens.\nThe worst trap was created by the Chinese officials and the People\u2019s Bank of China. The internet search engine Baidu decided to accept Bitcoin as a payment measure in November, and was followed by many smaller companies. The people of China have seen the diversification option in a virtual currency, but the government found a way to prohibit the use. There was no official ban claimed by the country, but banks and similar financial institutions were not allowed to service accounts for cryptocurrency exchange to or from fiat money, terminating the basic process of the coin society \u2013 depositing and withdrawing of funds.\nBitcoin Position in Business in 2013\nThe fact that the Bitcoin already has its own oligarchs and the amount is close to match the value of half a hundred speaks for it - the cryptographic currency is worth mining, investing and developing.\neBay president John Donahue, running PayPal, stated that digital currency is \u201cvery powerful thing\u201d encouraging the society to use and invest in Bitcoin businesses.\nThe Japanese exchange platform Mt.Gox serviced his millionth customer in December, being among the top-3 resources processing the Bitcoin transactions. The collaboration with Mayzus Financial Services inaugurated a new era and made the link between cryptocurrencies and fiat money more close and strong.\nThe first Bitcoin ATM, owned by Bitcoiniac startup, was installed in Vancouver. The terminal provides an easy way for Bitcoin users to buy, exchange and withdraw funds and attracts new people being a great advertising item. The company plans to install such units London, Berlin, Toronto and Montreal and to widen the network as new orders for such machines were received from other companies.", "birthday": "2013-12-30T15:14:00+00:00", "date": "2013-12-30 15:14:00", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 30}

As the price has hit the price of gold and was able to keep the position of the most expensive digital currency, several medical institutions have received points on the CoinMap.org, informing bitcoin users and activists of a new era of medical care.\nAs the year 2013 is going to finish in 6 days, we allowed ourselves to make a small review on and about clinics or practices that got interested in bitcoin and definitely made a great advertisement to the currency by their choice. The top-10 list was created in accordance with the data of press-releases, previous articles from our digital magazine, announcements from social networks and lists populated by other experts and journalists.\n1.  Nordorthopaedics clinic in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. The clinic is rather famous in their branch of activity and the acceptance of bitcoin allowed the doctors to spread a new step towards customers from all around the world, as well as minimize money losses considering the payment of transactions fees to the banks.\n2. Vanity Cosmetic Surgery from Florida, the USA  was also on the news. The key reason for accepting the coin was its anonymity, very important parameter not just in healthcare in general, but particularly in cosmetic and beauty surgery.\n3.  My Doctor Medical Group from San Francisco, the USA also presents the same reasons of the choice to accept the coin. Dr. Abramson has emphasized that the matters of privacy are above all, together with quality and safety.", "birthday": "2013-12-25T17:37:00+00:00", "date": "2013-12-25 17:37:00", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 25}

According to the statistics, there are about 60 different crypto currencies available on the Global Network, some of them outliving a similar rise of popularity and price like their more successful and lucky peer. On the 29th of November the British journalist created his own list of the most remarkable and forth the attention coins that should be considered both by experienced activists and cautious beginners. Our portal allowed itself to observe his paper and comments to create a similar ranking, but using the opinions of different supporters on the web.\nAccording to the stats as on the 13th of December 2013 presented by the CoinMarketCap the top-5 consists of the following coins (see the image below). Particularly this group we will consider as the basics of our case study. More information of the next currency can be found on the developers\u2019 pages or on forums.\nAfter Mr. Gibbs the most interesting among alternative coins are litecoin, Namecoin, Peercoin, Primecoin, Feathercoin, Novacoin, Infinitecoin, Megacoin, Quark coin. The last three of them are recent newcomers, whose potential should be proven by time. Only Infinitecoin was unable to join on the leading ten positions.\nSo let us start getting acquainted with our possible future friends. Assuming that the very first one, the humble leader Bitcoin, is very well known to us and does not need any additional praise or presentation we can go on to describe it opponents.\nLitecoin\nLitecoin has two acronyms one might stumble upon on the internet \u2013 LTC and XLT. The currency is derived from bitcoin. It is also mined, has the peer-to-peer principle, is not governed by any authority. However, is has some key differences from its \u201cparent\u201d. The network is faster \u2013 processes block of action of every 2,5 minutes, instead of 10 by bitcoin. For generation it uses a slightly simpler algorithm \u2013 can be mined on standard computers. And the final mark is equal to 84 million coins. As You can see the price still cannot be compared to the price of bitcoin.\nPeercoin", "birthday": "2013-12-14T13:58:00+00:00", "date": "2013-12-14 13:58:00", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 14}

NEVERTHELESS, IT IS WORTH TO MENTION THAT IT WAS A WEEK AFTER BITCOIN PRICE EXCEEDED $1,000.\nWE HAVE COLLECTED THE MOST POPULAR PUBLICATIONS ON COINTELEGRAPH AND SELECTED TOP FIVE NEWS OF THE WEEK. THIS IS OUR FIRST WEEKLY REVIEW IN DECEMBER.\n1\nThe most popular article of this week is \u201cYourFreeProxy secretly mining Bitcoins on users\u2019 computers\u201d.\nYourFreeProxy program\u2019s toolbar, was supposed to help users to create a VPN that allows them to circumnavigate firewalls and pay walls and browse websites in privacy but it was mining Bitcoin through end users\u2019 computers without them knowing. In late November one of Malwarebytes users reported a file that was using 50% of system resources on his/her computer. Malwarebytes sleuthed around and found out that the file, jh1d.exe is a Bitcoin Miner called jhProtominer, which runs through the command line.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether there are any possible legal consequences, as the Bitcoin mining may or may not follow the letter of the terms of service. In the meantime, if you have the YourFreeProxy toolbar, getting rid of that might free up some system resources.\nYourFreeProxy secretly mining Bitcoins on users \n2\nFor those who follow bitcoin technology development \u201c3 Bitcoin innovations to keep an eye on\u201d is the greatest review of the week.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/counting_sheep_really_makes_one_want_to_sleep", "title": " Counting Sheep Really Makes One Want to Sleep ", "content": "On the 4th December was published the article  \u201cHow Difficult is to Hide a Black in Sheep in a White Flock?\u201d  At that date it was impossible to doubt that the occasion to continue the story will be presented in the closest future not just by faith, but generally by the bitcoin community activists. It is a pity to announce that the detective game initiated by users, who suffered from the affair or started to follow the culprit due to pure interest of a hunter, have underestimated the opponent or opponents. The basic principles of the crypto coin network were wrongly interpreted and pushed many people to draw false conclusions. Digital world does not seem that univocal as it was believed to be. The relativity of the human decisions and inferences already has many examples, when innocent people were judged and punished \u2013 morally, or even physically. \nAllow me to make a small flashback \u2013 for those, who have not read the previous article and would like to get acquainted with the matter, and for those, have might have forgotten the chronicles. The canvas needs only some brushstrokes to make the flashback interesting and vivid.\nAt first, the page or online merchants\u2019 platform SheepMarketplace was closed. The Tor browser has followed it, as it was an anonymous browser to ensure deals considering the selling or purchase of illegal matters. The victims of the termination of both resources were many users, who were not able to withdraw funds from the platform. Payments were received by the service, but money has not had left them to their real owners. The version stated by the administration assured the users that only 5400 BTC are missing due to a dealer, who has found a bug and used it to steal the sum.\nThe second step was made by the users \u2013 activists willing to play detective and to determine the criminals, even return to money. This Robin Hoods understood at once that the amount of missing coin exceeds the 5400 BTC and is much bigger. Even the estimation of users missing their funds gave a number several folds bigger. Uniting of activists allowed spotting a wallet holding the stolen bicoins. The amount made this affair close or even equal to the greatest and most daring bank robberies in history. The sum was 96000 BTC and after the exchange ratio could provide its owner with 100 million dollars.\nThe next step was merely the exploitation of technology and coin basics. The Block Chain presents the necessary features. Comparing the crypto coin system principles of privacy with real world fiat money transactions can be named several differences. The credit card and financial institution regulated transaction create a bridge between the sender and receiver of money. All the data, like name, surname, account and other are known and kept by the financial institutions and customers have nothing else left as to trust in confidentiality. Transactions performed with bitcoins do not require such a medium between. Two wallets, two users, peer-to-peer have to obtain the approval of other users of the network. The numbers or names of wallets are known \u2013 a line of numbers and letter, but the key that comes as a pair is the secret of the owner, his private data from real life is not included, is unnecessary.\nIt seems to be enough for a 100% security and privacy. Attention! There are two exceptions \u2013 exchanging the crypto coins to fiat coin and vice a versa is associated with a real personality; the movement of extraordinary amounts of money having no analogues to exist in parallel makes impossible to hide them. The second rule became the stumbling rock of the crime. The user sheeproadreloaded2 followed the sum and in the final published the overall route. He survived the mixer that was unable to perform as it should \u2013 not enough money was inside to recombine the money. The last point \u2013 the wallet was successfully determined.\nEverything seemed to be brilliant, promising and positive, until\u2026 There was a \u201cbut\u201d, very strong one. One other user recognized that his money has gone to this wallet. Further investigations allowed declaring that this wallet is a technical address for internal work of the stock or exchange service - BTC-e. Our flashback includes the most actions performed by the \u201cdetectives\u201d. They, together with us, have landed in a dead-end. The path followed seemed to be correct \u2013 money is stolen, the platform closed. But the evidence shows that the criminal is gone, he was right \u2013 he exchanged the digital coins for fiat money. It is not the first huge transaction for the service. 190000 BTC were removed in November, either by the Winklevoss twins, or by the developer of bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto.\nAs can be claimed the detective games of the masses often lead to mistakes and failures. Normally, it brings up questions on privacy and security. Such \u201cinvestigators\u201d have vandalized the wall of the Brown University student Sunil Tripathi, because they believed that he was behind the terroristic act in Boston this year. FBI has proven that he was innocent, but he was found dead a week after the incident at the marathon.\nThe user sheeproadreloaded2 has left the process of search and commented on his action in a fed up manner \u2013 he claims to be tired, out of milk, in necessity to return to his daily routine. He thinks that bitcoins are real, because he sells them. The thinks that the crypto currency is not just a matter to provide power, it might change the time and space continuum.\nThe crowd believes that they have size the moderator Tom\u00e1\u0161 Jirzikovsk\u00fd of the terminated platform that definitely knows where has gone the money. He was ready to give a small interview on this case (the questions and answers are translated from the Chez language and sometimes are shortened).\nTo Tom\u00e1\u0161 Jirzikovsk\u00fd were presented the clues collected by the bitcoin society activists and he has given comments on them.\n1. Tom\u00e1\u0161 Jirzikovsk\u00fd owns a hosting for the domain sheepmarketplace.com on a virtual private server, where other domains under his control are located. Tom\u00e1\u0161 Jirzikovsk\u00fd: It is not a VPS server \u2013 it is a physical server. It belongs to DataCube in Slovakia. It has 17 of my projects. The server is rather old and is unable to place more of my projects.\n2. One of these pages is closely connected to SMP, as it uses the same basic technology or, maybe, even the API interface. Tom\u00e1\u0161 Jirzikovsk\u00fd: I do not understand what is meant by the author, but maybe he supposes that I am able to use Nette and PHP.\n3. The official reason to close the fan-page is not convincing. The page was created shortly after SMP. Tom\u00e1\u0161 Jirzikovsk\u00fd: I do not know precisely, when SMP was opened, I cannot comment this statement.\n4. Tom\u00e1\u0161 Jirzikovsk\u00fd \u2013 the first, who started to promote SMP (01.02.2013.). He recommended SMP and BMR (similar platform) as an alternative to Silk Road (11.04.2013.) Tom\u00e1\u0161 Jirzikovsk\u00fd:I do not know what kind of advertisement is taken as an example by the author, it is hard to give an answer for me.\n5. Tom\u00e1\u0161 Jirzikovsk\u00fd is the developer on C++, knows QT and Framework, uses Ubuntu, as well as the developer of the SMP.\nTom\u00e1\u0161 Jirzikovsk\u00fd: I have written several codes on C++, which are available on the network. It was a manager Apache MySql PHP project. I am ready to rpesent the unfinished codes. About Nette and my questions on forums \u2013 they are connected with work moments on mine, or customer projects.\n6. Tom\u00e1\u0161 Jirzikovsk\u00fd was complaining about the memory usage for the bitcoind on VPS server and has discussed the difficulties of hidden services for such functions, as email.\nTom\u00e1\u0161 Jirzikovsk\u00fd: yes, some time ago I have tried to find a solution for these the difficulties. I was bothered about it in general, willing to know if it is possible to launch such kind of service. There were not many replies from jurists, but I have not had any opportunity to ask somewhere else.\n7. Tom\u00e1\u0161 Jirzikovsk\u00fd and his girlfriend are active users of Tor browser, which can be seen on screenshots of their desktops.\nTom\u00e1\u0161 Jirzikovsk\u00fd (ironically): \u2026 The browser is required for operations with the bitcoin wallet, to prevent attacks from outside\u2026", "birthday": "2013-12-11T19:59:00+00:00", "date": "2013-12-11 19:59:00", "year": 2013, "month": 12, "day": 11}

Bitcoin is a virtual money created for criminals\nBitcoin caught people's eye in 2011. These days it was an \"official\" money used to buy goods on Silk Road - an on-line market for narcotic drugs, weapons, fake IDs etc. This October the Federal Bureau of Investigation closed Silk Road and arrested its owner, Ross William Ulbricht. The value of Bitcoin dropped, then increased and now it has achieved high results.

The FBI closed down the black market last month and identified Ulbricht as the owner.\nUlbricht\u2019s friends and family, seeking his release, have since raised $1 million-plus that they have pledged as bail money.\nUlbricht\u2019s defense attorney, Joshua Dratel, who has represented an Al Qaeda associate and a Guantanamo detainee, argues that Ulbricht is a model candidate for bail.\nIn a letter to Judge Kevin Fox, of the Southern District of New York, Dratel said Ulbricht plans to live with his aunt in New York if granted bail, and that his \u201cpeaceful character and reputation\u201d qualify him as a stand-up member of society.", "birthday": "2013-11-20T13:35:00+00:00", "date": "2013-11-20 13:35:00", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 20}

They concluded that digital currency is a legitimate financial instrument, and its widespread use has significant benefits for consumers. Opinion of state agencies considerably increases the chances of official recognition by the authorities of digital currency. According to their written agency representatives reports published this week \u2013 digital money offer real benefits and carry some risks as any other payment system.\nHearing of the Senate Committee main reason was to explore the potential opportunities and risks of the virtual currency, including the fact of recent close of the website Silk Road in October. Closure of the black market, where people could buy drugs, fake documents and other illegal goods for bitcoins, gave reason to believe that Bitcoin is becoming more widely recognized currency for not only for legitimate business.\nDuring the hearing in the Dirksen Senate Office Building most of the discussions were focused on the risks around digital currency. Senators were interested in understanding the ways how to regulate bitcoin and minimize all risks concerning digital currency.\nJerry Brito, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and director of its Technology Policy Program was also on hearing. He mentioned that: two years ago, everyone was scared when the Silk Road first appeared on the scene but since then, Congress has examined the issue better and now realizes that bitcoin has large potential. Unfortunately, as with any other new technology, this one also has some problems. It is important to keep a balance, and tend to look favorably on this technology.\nBitcoin is especially attractive currency for people who want to protect their identity as it gives ability to make anonymous transaction. Immediately after closing the Silk Road, bitcoin prices fell but soon after it have recovered and continue to rise for new record levels.\nCommittee is aware that digital currency has reached a price record of $500 this week, which mean that it has grown more than x30 times during this year.\nBen Bernanke, the Fed chairman, has responded to the request of the Senate, saying that he has no plans to regulate digital currency. \"Despite the fact that the Federal Reserve System as a whole following the developments in the field of virtual currency and other innovative payment systems, we can not directly control or regulate these innovations and the companies that provide them to the market.\"\nHowever, the anonymity of cyberspace gives opportunities to launder huge money. Agencies believe that it is important to minimize the ease of transactions for criminals.\nMythili Raman, Assistant Attorney General, said that because every bitcoin transaction is in the public domain it is possible to trace the movement of money between accounts.

First, Bitcoin as a digital form of private money has none of the issues of physical production and storage issues of, say, gold coins, so no government is needed to reassure users of the currency\u2019s worth and security. That\u2019s all just baked in.\nSecond, calculation of the Bitcoin algorithm limits the total number of Bitcoins available \u2014 there can only ever be 21 million. This both ensures anonymity and keeps price and demand in a pretty linear relationship.\nWhelan argues that having just an algorithm does not insulate the currency at all from competitors. There is Litecoin, he points out. And someone could just create a better algorithm.\nSo, why Bitcoin over the other cryptocurrencies? What\u2019s going to make one the VHS and all the others Betamax?\nThat uncertainty is the big difference between Bitcoins and the dollar.

Frequent system hacks, DDoS attacks and other regular problems allowed users to understand that not all bitcoin transactions are successful.\nHowever, there are already a second generation exchangers that can guarantee the secure exchange without problems and the possibility of losing money. One of these resources is CoinX, based in the US exchange which provides services for both American and foreign clients.\nMegan Burton, the founder of CoinX, said that in the beginning the development team invested over $1 million in the developing of the platform, which is currently still in beta testing.\nShe highlighted the safety of such investment and its legal compliance.\nBurton has 15 years of experience in the IT-security. Since 2004 she has served as CEO of security and IT security services in a company SeeGee Technologies, and before that she worked in Logicalis and Dimension Data.\nMegan's main responsibilities in CoinX are an encoded database and application firewalls at work with the security of the system.\nIn addition, she provides services to a \"major exchange\" company, which, according to rumors, is a New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\nAs explained by Burton, a new service designed for institutional investors was introduced at the end of last month, at the Money 2020 exhibition. She argued: \"We are seeing more and more companies that give preference to alternative trading systems within the broker dealer market, and so amongst institutional investors.\"\nHowever, the company is not going to fit the specifics of new customers and especially the institutional investors. Developer is not planning to create an option to make transactions involving the producers and sellers of goods, despite the fact that recently opened British website Coinfloor and New York company Coinsetter did it.\nCoinX adheres to the traditional approach of establishing flexible commissions, depending on the volume ranges. For example, 500 BTC or less will be taxed 0.3% fee. But when it comes to transactions between 100,000 and 150,000 BTC the fee is reduced to just 0.1%.\nCoinX accepts payments in three currencies: US dollars, euros and pounds sterling (thanks to the cooperation with the British Financial Conduct Authority).\nBut the service does not provide any deposit options for foreign participants. Furthermore, CoinX also is not using the European direct payment network SEPA. Instead of this all participants outside the 50 states are limited to use only bank wire. Why is this happening? According to Megan, providing services to American customers can make international banks susceptible to regulation.\nBurton says that there is a lot of pressure from the United States. They are US citizens and the organization is also based in America, so the international community usually is beware of working with US citizens whose financials is subjected to strict regulation. For example, British Coinfloor even completely blocked the ability for Americans to use their platform and have focused on domestic market. In the USA, CoinX continues to struggle with compliance regulations to expand its influence in all 50 states. According to Megan, the registration with FinCEN was easy enough, but for the coordination of all documents at the state level takes time.\n\"Each state has different guidelines and definitions as to what money is,\" says Burton. Also, for example, the definition of money transmission varies from state to state, however CoinX goal is to become an exchanger within the whole America.\nAt the time of writing, CoinX already operates in more than half of the states in the country, and is discussing further cooperation with many other parties. But Megan believes that this process will be delayed for a period of 18 to 24 months.", "birthday": "2013-11-10T10:05:00+00:00", "date": "2013-11-10 10:05:00", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 10}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin_in_india_drivers_and_barriers_to_adoption", "title": " Bitcoin in India: Drivers and Barriers to Adoption ", "content": "The conditions in such developed countries as China, Argentina, Cyrprus or in developing country like Kenya bear witness to current positions of bitcoin on the worldwide area and shows its potential and advantages over other factors. All these countries mentioned above are characterized by high inflation rates, strong control of capital from the government or there is a combination of both these economic factors\\. Such situation appears in India, so it is essential to make an analysis in order to review the current economic position of this country, its climate and the factors which have an influence on propensity of the population to accept the bicoin on a large scale.\nIndia\u2019s Rupee Woes The value of the Indian Rupee has decreased sweepingly following to international economic factors and operations of Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Analyzing of this problems and their direct influence on the INR can be useful for evaluating the utility of bitcoin in India.\nUS Federal Reserve Tapering\nFrom the beginning of the May, there was a considerable declining of Rupee against dollar on 24% and it accessed the lowest point of ?68/$ on the 29th of August. The recent corrections and regulation of the language from the Federal Reserve are the main reasons of this trend which affect on decreasing purchases of asset on 85$ mlrd per month. Due to the decreasing of the monetarization from Fed, the growth rate in USD supply is going to fall and accordingly it makes USD currency stronger and therefore, owing to the USD strengthening, INR and other currencies become weaker significantly.\nFed tapering has extra influence on such developing markets like India. To be concrete, due to purchasing fewer US Treasuries (UST), the supply of USTs probably goes up. Meanwhile, the extra supply decreases the the price of UST`s and provides the increasing of the yields on bonds. The effect of such process is ponderable: since May UST yields reached the highest rate, having even 115 basis points.\nThe increasing of UST yields affects negatively on developing markets. According to earlier expectations, all returns grow on comparatively low-risk USTs, money runs-out of high risk investment similar to those in developing markets(India for example) and into USTs, which is much more tempting on a \u201crisk-weighted basis\u201d now. The results are not consolatory: there is an exodus of the capital from such emerging countries as India which makes the amount of USD lower comparing with INR.\nCurrent Account Deficit\nIndia\u2019s current account deficit, or the difference in total value between exports and imports, has grown to a record 4.8% of GDP in 2013. This can have two profound effects on the value of the INR. First is the direct impact of sending more money off shore than is flowing back in. Since most international trade is denominated in USD, this means that more USD is leaving India from trade than is returning. As described above, if the availability of USD to INR decreases, the relative value of USD to INR increases.\nThe second meaning of the concept \u201ca current account deficit\u201d is that a country is a net debtor. Due to expectation of increasing the interest rate in India because of US Fed actions, the cost of repaying becomes negative factor for INR because investors propose the inflation the tool of decreasing debts.\nOil and Gold Imports\nThe current effect of the INR on the prices for goods should not be underestimated. There had been a significant increase of price for oil during the last several years from 76 per barrel in August 2010 to $109 per barrel in August 2013. Due to the fact that the leading position of world oil trade belongs to USD, the increasing in prices causes only the deficit of India`s currency and consequently it decreases USD holdings within India. The one of the most serious consequences of such problem is the maintenance of oil imports from Iran. That means that Iran is one of the minorities of the countries that accepts oil trade denomination in INR. The same effect on the current account balance can be noticed in importing of gold, but for the opposite reason. Being the largest world consuming gold nation, Indian citizens take into consideration the decline in prices of gold reaching its pick of 162 tonnes in May. Nowadays the gold in India being in demand is a cultural historic asset which is always presented as gift on festivals and wedding parties\nGovernment Intervention\nTaking into the consideration the effect of the current account balance a decline of INT. the government makes an attempt to stop outflows using some tariffs and capital controls. Such capital controls were created by the RBI this month which put the investors and especially the Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh in shocked conditions. Furthermore, such capital controls would not be taken into account as India would continue supporting the open economy which led to increasing of the economy in general for the last 6 month in spite of the process of determining of these measures. Some measures on importing gold were adopted by Indian government this year. Such situation causes the growth of importing tariffs on the bijou metals from 6% to 10%. Furthermore now it is essential to get a license from foreign trade office and try to encourage the commercial banks in order to purchase gold directly from consumers and for stemming imports it is important to transfer it to the local refiners. Such actions were attempted in order to increase the prices in India and make them higher on $45/per oz over the prices in London. Indian citizens are searching for alternative ways for wealth storage and historic transactions on a culturally significant commodity at the aggregate expense of the valuation of the INR.\nBitcoin\u2019s Potential in India\nTalking about the terms of inflation and capital controls which are familiar to the community of bitcoin, somebody can suggest that Indian citizens should switch to the opportunity in order to accept the digital currency as bitcoin proliferation can become rather important for the ponderable future. At the same moment whereas the demand for gold has increased in India, there are some additional alternative store of wealth offering by multiple applications which ensure stability and no transferring of demand to bitcoin. Moreover, the state can encounter on a range of regulatory and technological concerns before the moment of reaching the broad acceptance by bitcoin.\nCapital Controls\nWith the RBI placing restrictions on the amount of capital both individuals and corporations can invest overseas, as well as the amount of gold that can be imported, Indians will continue to seek alternative means of wealth transfer and storage. Bitcoin may serve as an opportunity to send investment offshore without having to clear through an intermediary bank, or an alternative store of money if gold becomes inaccessible. This scenario has already unfolded in Argentina under more drastic applications from the same family of regulations; it\u2019s not unreasonable to believe that if similarly pushed that Indians would seek similar measures.\nTechnological Penetration\nAs it can be seen from the previous researches, the data shows the interrelation between bitcoin admission and internet penetration in the country below. India takes the sixth lowest place of internet distribution among 100 largest countries with only 12.6% of the citizens having the access to the internet. In spite of the total size of the population of 1.2 billion people in India, it puts the country on the third place with 150 million users of internet-using population in the world after the USA and China.", "birthday": "2013-11-03T18:20:00+00:00", "date": "2013-11-03 18:20:00", "year": 2013, "month": 11, "day": 3}

In theory, developments and fixes should be transparent to align with this design feature.\nHowever, when a couple of security bugs were patched in September, developments were not made in the spirit of open design but rather were implemented without discussion.\nThe original problem could be traced back to a denial of service attack Bitcoin suffered in June. An initial patch fixed a flaw that allowed attackers to stuff system memory with flawed transactions.\nHowever, that first patch had its own bugs, and it too had to be resolved.\nThe bugs themselves are not the issue here. What bothers some, including blogger Sergio Lerner, is the opacity with which Bitcoin\u2019s core development team implemented those changes.\n\u201c[T]he github commit of the patch does not show a history of a discussion regarding the patch correctness, nor is it recorded if the code was audited and by whom,\u201d Lerner said.\nThis indicates that the testing performed before releasing the patch could have been faulty, and this gets to the heart of computer security. When fixing a security issue, you need to be able to understand why the flaw was there to begin with so you can anticipate the possibility of future problems.\nBitcoin\u2019s open-source design is supposed to allow anyone to spot a problem and comment on it. Understanding and solutions can thus be crowd sourced.\nInstead, what appeared to happen was someone spotted a problem, cobbled together a poor solution, then tried to white out that mistake.\nSure, it\u2019s natural to want to sweep one\u2019s mistakes under the rug. But to obscure development with such opacity undercuts the power of crowd sourced problem solving, and now we cannot know what problems could have been revealed in the testing process.\nAgain, Bitcoin was designed in the spirit of transparency. It\u2019s harder for governments or saboteurs to install flaws or back doors with everyone going over the code.\nDoes that sound paranoid? It shouldn\u2019t: We now know that the NSA deliberately introduced flaws into standard encryption protocols so that our movements online could be tracked even when we were told they couldn\u2019t be.\nIf Bitcoin users \u2014 and that goes for the whole community, from traders to miners to developers \u2014 fail to uphold a standard of openness, then the currency\u2019s baked-in security features will all be for naught.\nA summary of some Bitcoin-Pi innovations we have seen", "birthday": "2013-09-06T13:20:00+01:00", "date": "2013-09-06 12:20:00", "year": 2013, "month": 9, "day": 6}
