Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nIntercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE) has been loading up on digital assets for its cryptocurrency platform Bakkt, according to its chief executive officer Jeffrey Sprecher. This has helped ICE buy assets at a discount, which would not have happened if the markets were in a bull phase. Sprecher expects Bakkt to start operations later in 2019.\nAttention has been shifting to institutional investors since the bear phase started. Stronger hands with deeper pockets are needed to provide stability in crypto markets. In a survey of 411 United States institutional investors, Fidelity Investments found that 47% of the participants believe that digital assets have a place in their investment portfolios.\nThe major attraction is the low correlation with other asset classes. Converesly, unclear regulation, lack of fundamentals, volatility, etc, were some of the hurdles in investing in digital assets.\nAlong with institutional involvement, mass adoption of cryptocurrencies is another important activity that can boost prices. In this regard, the markets are watching the development of Facebook\u2019s rumored \u201cFB Coin.\u201d Sources have said the Wall Street Journal that Facebook is looking to raise $1 billion in investments for its cryptocurrency stablecoin. With Facebook\u2019s mass reach, it can bring cryptocurrencies to the mainstream at a faster pace.\nThe recent recovery in Bitcoin has gathered pace and has pushed its market capitalization above $100 billion. Altcoins have also benefited from the bullish sentiment. After the rally, is it a good time to buy or to book profits? Let\u2019s find out.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) has surged towards its overhead resistance of $5,900. We like the pickup in momentum. This suggests confidence among the bulls that the leading digital currency will extend its recovery. If the price scales above $5,900, it will be a major sentiment booster. There is a minor psychological resistance at $6,000 but we expect it to be crossed. The next level to watch is $6,480.54. We expect the zone between $6,000\u2013$6,480.54 to offer a stiff resistance. Hence, the traders can tighten their stops to protect their paper profits.\n\nContrary to our bullish view, if the BTC/USD pair fails to sustain above $5,900, it can witness profit booking that can drag it to the 20-day EMA. The pair might also enter into a consolidation between $4,914.11 and $5,900 for a few days. The trend will turn negative on a breakdown of $4,914.11. Until then, the bulls will continue to buy the dips. Traders can trail the stops on the remaining long positions to $5,400.\nCurrently, both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is also trying to break out of the negative divergence. This is a bullish sign. It shows that the path of least resistance is to the upside.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) has broken out of the downtrend line. It is currently facing resistance at the $180\u2013$190.54 zone. If the bulls scale this zone, the digital currency can rally to $225 and above it to $256. Traders can buy above $192 and keep an initial stop loss of $146. As the risk to reward ratio is not very attractive, the position size can be about 40% of usual. We will suggest to trail the stops higher at the first available opportunity.\n\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the ETH/USD pair fails to ascend the overhead resistance zone and breaks below $148. Currently, the 20-day EMA is starting to turn up and the RSI has risen into positive territory. This suggests that the bulls have a minor advantage in the short term. The next couple of days are critical as it will set the stage for the next leg of the sustained move.\nXRP/USD\nWhile most major cryptocurrencies are on fire, Ripple (XRP) continues to lag behind. It is still trading below the 20-day EMA and close to the lower end of the range. This suggests a lack of interest among the bulls.\n\nThe XRP/USD pair needs to break out of the moving averages and $0.33108 to signal some buying. If the follow up buying pushes the price above $0.37835, we expect the pair to pick up momentum.\nOn the other hand, if the digital currency fails to move up, the bears will again try to break down of the critical support at $0.27795. We will wait for the breakout above $0.33108 to sustain before suggesting a long position.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has broken out of the downtrend line, which is a positive sign. The 20-day EMA is gradually turning up and the RSI has risen into positive territory. This shows that the bulls have the upper hand.\n\nThe BCH/USD pair can now move up to $335.62 and above it to $363.30. We expect this level to act as a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from one of these resistance levels, the pair will trade in a range for a few days.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency fails to sustain above the downtrend line and slips back to $255. The trend will turn negative on a breakdown of $225.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) has broken out of the 20-day EMA, which is a positive sign. It can now rally to $84.3439 and above it to $91. The digital currency has formed a cup and handle formation that will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $91. This pattern has a target objective of $158.91. Traders can wait for the price to close above $91 to attempt this trade. The stop loss for this trade can be kept at $66 initially, which can be raised later.\n\nBut if the LTC/USD pair fails to climb the overhead resistances, it might remain range bound for a few days. The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is just above the midpoint. This suggests range-bound trading action in the short term. The trend will turn bearish on a breakdown and close below the recent lows of $66.470. It is always better to wait for the pattern to complete to go long, instead of buying in anticipation.\nEOS/USD\nEOS has broken out of the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA. This suggests that the recent pullback is over and it will now march toward $6.0726 and above it $6.8299. The 20-day EMA is gradually turning up and the RSI has jumped into positive territory. This shows that the bulls have the advantage in the short term.\n\nNonetheless, if the bulls fail to sustain the current levels, it will indicate profit booking that can drag the EOS/USD pair back to the 20-day EMA. A breakdown of the uptrend line will complete a rising wedge pattern and shift the advantage to the bears. Until then, any dip towards the 20-day EMA can be used as a buying opportunity.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) rose above the previous intraday lifetime high of $26.4732350 and made a new high at $26.6428765. However, the bulls could not sustain the new high and the price has retreated back below it.\n\nThis shows profit booking at higher levels, but if the bears fail to sink the BNB/USD pair below the 20-day EMA, we anticipate another attempt by the bulls to make a new high. Both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is in positive territory. This suggests that the bulls are in command.\nHowever, if the price plunges below the 20-day EMA, it can drop to the 50-day SMA. A breakdown of this support will signal a deeper correction. We remain bullish and on the lookout for a reliable pattern that offers an attractive risk to reward ratio.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) again broke below the uptrend line but found buyers at lower levels. While the repeated breach of a support line weakens it, the bears have not been able to sustain the price below the uptrend line. A breakdown of $0.09478125 can sink the digital currency to $0.08.\n\nBut, if the XLM/USD pair breaks out of the moving averages, it can rise to $0.12039489 and above it to $0.13250273. Currently, both the moving averages are flat and the RSI is just below 50. This points to a possible consolidation in the short term. We do not find any reliable buy setup, hence, we are not suggesting a long position in it.\nADA/USD\nCardano (ADA) is trying to break out of the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line. If successful, it can move up to $0.082952 and above it to $0.094256. However, the flat 20-day EMA and the RSI close to the midpoint suggest that range-bound trading is probable.\n", "birthday": "2019-05-03T20:26:00+01:00", "date": "2019-05-03 19:26:00", "year": 2019, "month": 5, "day": 3}

Those transactions \u2014 which also have not been disclosed to investors \u2014 treat Tether\u2019s cash reserves as Bitfinex\u2019s corporate slush fund, and are being used to hide Bitfinex\u2019s massive, undisclosed losses and inability to handle customer withdrawals.\u201d\nYet, despite the troubling development in the iFinex-Bitfinex case, the price of bitcoin has increased from $5,135 to over $5,735 in the past week as of press time.\nWhat triggered the bitcoin rally?\nIn an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, Crypto Rand, a widely recognized cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst, said that the upside movement of bitcoin and the rest of the market may have been simply technical.\nAccording to the analyst, throughout the past two weeks, technical indicators were pointing toward a bullish momentum for bitcoin. As the market recovered fairly quickly from the Tether scandal, it likely boosted the confidence of existing investors in the market.\n\u201cFor me, there is no fundamental reason behind. The Tether situation caused a dump that was recovered in no time. But even that dump stopped in the uptrend range channel support without causing major damages to the macrostructure. My perspective about it is clear. All relays on TA. It was looking pretty bullish since two weeks [ago].\u201d\n#Bitcoin looking solid here. Bullish pennant on the making. Target over the $6,000 region. pic.twitter.com/3WMFkuKzBN\u2014 Crypto Rand (@crypto_rand) April 22, 2019\n\nImmediately after Tether and Bitfinex\u2019s general counsel, Stuart Hoegner, disclosed in an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court of the State of New York, eToro CEO Yoni Assia suggested that the incident could serve as a catalyst for the near-term rally of bitcoin.\n\u201cAre the news supposed to pump or dump BTC? It\u2019s bad news, but if $2 billion USDT get exchanged to BTC it actually increases its price... what a predicament. Tether Lawyer Admits Stablecoin Now 74% Backed by Cash and Equivalents,\u201d Assia said.\nAs Tether holders began to sell the stablecoin for bitcoin \u2014 anticipating the stablecoin to lose its peg to the U.S. dollar \u2014 it may have driven the demand for the asset on paper. Tether investors buying bitcoin to either keep their funds in bitcoin or to sell for fiat could have fueled the momentum of the asset.\nCan bitcoin sustain its current momentum?\nSeveral prominent investors in the crypto space such as Vinny Lingham from Multicoin Capital have said that bitcoin surpassing the $6,200 to $6,400 range would officially signal the beginning of a new bull market. Lingham said:\n\u201cThe key indicator for the start of a sustainable bull run is likely a decoupling of asset values from Bitcoin (i.e. Bitcoin\u2019s strength weakens other networks or vice versa). Anything else is just speculation again (maybe we need another bubble to learn more lessons?\u201cThat said, if we can break $6,200 for BTC, it will likely mark the start of another major bull run and could run hot and high, but if it\u2019s pure speculation and other assets benefit disproportionately to value created, it\u2019s likely not going to end well again!\u201d\n\nThe valuation of the crypto market has recovered to $185 billion, adding $7 billion overnight\nSource: coinmarketcap.com\nBut, some traders in the cryptocurrency sector remain cautious on the short-term trend of the asset because of both technical and fundamental factors.\nDonAlt, a cryptocurrency technical analyst, for instance, said that the Bitfinex premium indicates the lack of stability in the market that could potentially leave the asset vulnerable to a drop below $5,000.\nCrypto Rand told Cointelegraph that bitcoin is facing strong resistance and that it may take several months to break past the resistance, which suggests that in the short-term, the asset may struggle to break out of the $6,000 region:\n\u201cRight now we are facing probably the strongest horizontal resistance on the whole Bitcoin chart. I don't think it will be easy to cross but I'm confident about a breakout during the next months; a breakout that will unfold another bull run. One indicator I'm following closely to track the status of BTC its market capitalization, which right now is showing clear momentum after crossing the $100 billion mark or the first time in 2019.\u201d\nMomentum has been building since December\nIn recent months, bitcoin has largely depended on momentum and technical factors to record upside movements.\nThe highly anticipated block reward halving that is expected to occur in May 2020 is considered a strong fundamental factor that could serve as a solid catalyst for the medium-term price trend of the asset.\nBut, most of the year-to-date gain of bitcoin from $3,150 to $5,700 is likely to have started with a sudden surge in the price of bitcoin from $4,200 to $5,000 in the first week of April, which also was caused by technical factors boosted by a spike in the volume of the CME bitcoin futures market. Mati Greenspan, a senior analyst at eToro, told Cointelegraph in an interview:\n\u201cThe crypto market has been gathering a lot of momentum since the mid-December lows and it seems a lot of traders are turning bullish. The April 2nd surge broke us through some significant barriers and this morning we're even pushing further.\u201d\nIn the foreseeable future, while some traders have expressed concerns about the Tether controversy, Greenspan noted that if investors dump Tether on the market, investors will likely end up buying bitcoin, further pushing the demand for the asset up.\n\u201cAny erosion of trust is more likely to send Bitcoin up rather than down. At the moment there is about $2.8 billion parked in Tether. If investors end up dumping it, they'll probably just buy Bitcoin.\u201d\nIn the past several days, the \u201creal 10\u201d volume of bitcoin, the legitimate daily spot volume of bitcoin calculated using the methodology presented by Bitwise Asset Management, has increased to nearly $900 million, based on data provided by OnChainFX.\nIn March, Bitwise Asset Management calculated the \u201creal 10\u201d volume \u2014 which is composed of volume from exchanges with at least $1 million in daily bitcoin volume \u2014 to be around $270 million.\n2/ First, key takeaways:A. 95% of reported BTC spot volume is fakeB.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-security-tokens-can-prevent-an-impending-financial-crisis", "title": " How Security Tokens Can Prevent an Impending Financial Crisis ", "content": "\nMany economists argue that the root causes of the 2008 global financial crisis have yet to be addressed comprehensively, or that measures taken have been exhausted, such as the extent to which quantitative easing was used, which has been put forward by the deputy director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nSome argue that the efforts to address the causes of the crisis have actually made the system more \u2014 rather than less \u2014 susceptible to a catastrophic collapse. On the heels of the recent yield curve inversion, finding new solutions that address the causes of the 2008 crisis are more important than ever. The yield curve inversion, an 18-month leading indicator of looming liquidity challenges, has proceeded every major recession since the 1970s, including the global financial crisis of 2008.\nThe time to pursue new approaches to mitigate liquidity events is now. An investigation of the systemic weaknesses that led to the crisis points to the promise of a new financial instrument that has entered the market \u2014 tokenized securities. The liquidity benefits of these instruments derived from the strengths of blockchain and distributed ledger technology suggest that a new approach is possible to aid in preventing and addressing a repeat (or worse) of the 2008 downturn.\nWhile the driving forces that produced the toxic instruments that were at the center of crisis remain a fiercely debated issue, there is consensus on the structural weaknesses that led to the systemic spread of their collapse. Regarding the forces that produced the toxic instruments, some claim that deregulation caused the rise of flawed residential mortgage-backed security (RMBS) portfolios, while others point to overreaching government policies that drove lenders to issue subprime mortgages.\nEven with these differences, all sides agree the crisis was, at its core, an issue of transparency in the performance of the RMBS portfolios and the lack of liquidity of interests in these massive issuances.\nPolitical and regulatory solutions of various sorts have been proposed and tried, but the time has come for another approach, one that recognizes the powerful advances in distributed ledger technology to help address these issues of transparency and liquidity. There is one technology that truly enables both: security tokens.\nSecurity tokens\nSecurity tokens serve as digital representations of any other tradable financial asset, including equity shares of companies, interests in funds, contracts entitled to a specific slice of future revenue streams, ownership of intellectual property, fractional ownership of real estate and other physical assets, and derivatives themselves. Security tokens can be regulated and effectively managed, making it easy to form capital and setting the stage for a reformed financial service infrastructure. After the experiment with initial coin offerings (ICOs) and utility tokens, the security token offering (STO), private placement offerings and how they are traded on exchanges is being done in a legal way, complying with existing regulations by the authorities in each jurisdiction in which they operate \u2014 including existing United States regulations from the 1930s. \nWith the yield curve inversion coupled with recent downturns and corrections in the stock market, fears of a building crisis are mounting. Many armchair economists predict an economic downturn is a certainty every seven to 10 years. As we reflect on the 10-year anniversary of the 2008 crisis and try to understand the disruption to global supply chains in a new environment of trade wars, it is important to analyze the fundamental problems that led us down this path of economic turmoil and why security tokens can help stave off future financial disasters. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe beginning of the end\nBy September 2008, the $2 trillion RMBS market collapsed and sent a ripple through the balance sheets of most major financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad. This resulted in a global crisis of liquidity, as both debt and equity markets froze. At the eye of the storm was the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, which delivered subprime residential mortgages with seemingly reckless abandon. As loan default rates rose, RMBS portfolios were under increased pressure. This led to the U.S. government issuing the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) \u2014 a $700 billion bailout to purchase distressed assets that yielded limited results \u2014 and the United Kingdom government\u2019s $850 billion bank rescue package.\nWhile the catalyst for this prevalence of bad loans is still up for debate, many agree that a potent cocktail of inefficiencies turned what should have been a salvageable market correction into a full-scale crisis. For one, credit rating agencies lacked effective models to rate risk after issuance and lacked objectivity in establishing ratings. Investors relied on these misguided ratings and continued to pump money into portfolios despite their eroding fundamentals. Lack of transparency and inefficient secondary markets made it difficult to price and expensive to sell these assets on the market. As a result, institutions were stuck with these assets and eventually collapsed under their own weight.\nAnother fundamental issue that led to the crisis \u2014 and has yet to be addressed by regulatory reform such as the G-20 coordinated reduction in interest rates and a $5 trillion expansion in April 2009, as well as developing concepts like the Volcker rule in the U.S. and ring-fencing in Europe \u2014 is the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d nature of the offerings and players themselves.\nThe barriers of entry to securitization markets drove the centralization of issuances to astronomical heights, as a few participants came to dominate the market. The combination of closed circles and high costs of issuance ran securitized portfolios into the billions and caused a domino effect upon failure. In addition, a lack of liquidity in private securities markets made it difficult to rebalance or break up portfolios by selling smaller positions to a wider pool of potential buyers \u2014 or even by selling individual assets.\nCoupling this with the significant leverage financial institutions were taking on, they reduced their ability to absorb loss, sending ripples globally. Sometimes, the unintended consequences of regulation are more damaging than the value proposition of that legislation.\nUnfortunately, the issues behind this crisis remain in play and require a solution that addresses these deeply ingrained inefficiencies. If this goes unresolved, a complete financial collapse is no longer a matter of if, but when.\u00a0\nThe next phase\nTo combat the issues that led to the 2008 global financial crisis, the adoption of security tokens becomes mission-critical. Many analysts predict that the majority of financial products will one day be traded on the blockchain as security tokens, with programmable smart contracts \u2014 and for good reason: Only security tokens can bring greater transparency, oversight, access and liquidity to the market. \u00a0\nThis begs the question: Why are security tokens not more prevalent in institutional markets? In short, it\u2019s a matter of skepticism born of misunderstanding and a lack of education. The cryptocurrency market most recognizable to the general public is one that consists of assets like bitcoin, which are exchanged principally for their speculative market value and lack tangible underlying value. \u00a0\nThe historical volatility and current state of the cryptocurrencies market certainly does not help the situation: 2018 is considered the worst year yet for cryptocurrencies by market cap, as the market plummeted from $800 billion in January 2018 to approximately $121 billion in December.\nComplicating matters is the mistaken conflation of ICOs with true security tokens. After a barrage of ICOs left investors reeling from poor performance, data leaks and stolen funds, the public has rightfully grown skeptical of nondilutive assets sold to retail buyers and traded mainly by speculators. Another misleading factor is that many in the cryptocurrency space are wrongfully promoting security token offerings as ICOs with a veneer of compliance.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bart-chilton-former-cftc-regulator-crypto-holder-and-ico-endorser", "title": " Bart Chilton: Former CFTC Regulator, Crypto Holder and ICO Endorser ", "content": "Last weekend, Bart Chilton, a former commissioner of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and early advocate for cryptocurrency regulation, died at the age of 58.\nApart from his work for the regulator, he was best known as the host of RT (formerly Russia Today) America\u2019s financial show \u201cBoom Bust\u201d \u2014 in which he often covered cryptocurrency news \u2014 and as the author of the book \u201cPonzimonium: How Scam Artists Are Ripping Off America.\u201d\nThe news about Chilton\u2019s death was broken by RT, his latest employer, on April 27. According to the TV network, the Boom Bust host passed away as a result of \u201ca sudden illness.\u201d Later, CNBC wrote that Chilton died because of complications from pancreatic cancer, citing a family member.\n25 years of public service: Chilton\u2019s bio\nPrior to working for the Russian state-owned television channel, Chilton had an eventful political career in the U.S. government, which lasted 25 years.\nChilton grew up in Ogden Dunes, Indiana, where he worked at a steel mill for a year before entering Purdue University in 1979. As he told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), the heavy manual labor shaped his mindset before majoring in political science and communications, as Chilton felt that someone had to look out for \"the little guy.\"\nHowever, Chilton dropped out one semester before graduation to work on Democratic Party\u2019s 1984 political campaigns. From 1985 to 1995, he worked in the U.S. House of Representatives, serving as a legislative director for three different members of Congress and as the executive director of the bipartisan Congressional Rural Caucus. He later joined the executive branch during the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, in which he became the deputy chief of staff to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman and acted as a liaison to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nIn 2007, Chilton was nominated to be a CFTC commissioner by President Bush, and his position was subsequently confirmed by the Senate. He was renominated by President Barack Obama in 2009 and finished his work for the agency in 2014. Chilton chaired the agency\u2019s Energy and Environmental Advisory and the Global Markets Advisory panels.\nSoon after becoming a commissioner, Chilton started to champion strong pro-market regulation views, as illustrated by his first official remarks. Specifically, the public servant drew attention to the phenomenon of \u201cmassive passives,\u201d arguing that the influx of pension and institutional investments provoked the volatility in commodity prices. As he explained to the WSJ, a \"massive passive\" could represent as much as 20% of one market \u2014 a percentage that \"gets to be where you might not be able to control prices, but you have the possibility of moving them.\"\nBloomberg describes Chilton as \u201ca U.S. regulator who pushed for tighter regulation of swaps and derivatives.\u201d According to The Washington Post, he was \u201cperhaps best known for his mane of silver white hair and unconventional speeches, loaded with pop culture references and catchy phrases.\u201d For instance, he famously nicknamed high-frequency traders \u201ccheetahs\u201d who race \u201cin and out\u201d of the market.\nIn November 2013, Chilton announced he was leaving the CFTC \u201cin the not too distant future,\u201d without specifying the reason. Soon, he began working for a high-frequency trading association, as a senior policy advisor at DLA Piper law firm.\n\u201cPeople are going to say, \u2018wait a minute, you used to beat the [stuff] out of those guys,\u2019 and I did, but I never said they should go away,\u201d Chilton told CNBC of the move.\nChilton and crypto: From calling bitcoin a \u201cshadow currency\u201d to holding and ICO endorsements\nAlthough Chilton has said that he\u2019s been calling for cryptocurrency regulation since 2012, he never addressed the topic during his congressional speeches while working for the CFTC, as per the agency\u2019s database. In fact, it seems that Chilton first publicly discussed bitcoin in May 2013 on CNBC, when he declared he was not \u201c100% saying we should regulate it, but if anybody is going to, it seems like something we should consider.\u201d\n\u201cIt [bitcoin] is being potentially used for, you know, guns and money, and nobody is looking after it. It really is a shadow currency.\u201d\nFurther on in the interview, Chilton argued that cryptocurrency holders \u201cwere losing actual money on this [bitcoin],\u201d to support his viewpoint. \u201cIf people have the possibility of not being backed up, if things aren\u2019t cleared, if there is no margin requirement, you don\u2019t want this to be just a house of cards that can impact it.\u201d\nHe then implied that the CFTC might oversee the cryptocurrency sector in the future, given that people seem to hold virtual currencies for future profits. That, in turn, appears to fit the description of a commodity and hence fall within the regulator\u2019s purview, Chilton argued.\n\u201cIf you guys want to be a shill for the financial industry, and support a shadow currency that people purchase drugs and money with, have a party, man. My job as a regulator, I\u2019m going to look after it.\u201d\nIn 2016, however, Chilton (no longer a CFTC commissioner) wrote a commentary for CNBC in which he called the bitcoin and blockchain industry \u201cdisruptive,\u201d and argued that President Obama should ensure that its growth is not damaged by overly tight regulations, comparing it to the early IT-industry:\n\u201cWhen the internet was being developed, an effort and initiative by the Clinton administration to ensure that the fledgling idea would not be overly regulated was put in place \u2014 the 1997 Framework for Global Electronic Commerce. The point: to ensure laws and regulation would not negatively impact innovation. Current CFTC Commissioner Chris Giancarlo recently (and rightly) called for such protection for digital currency. President Obama should heed the call.\u201d\nIn September 2017, Chilton highlighted bitcoin\u2019s volatility as a major issue, saying that he would have started a probe into potential market manipulation if he still worked at the CFTC at the time. Specifically, he argued that the \u201cblind spot\u201d occurred because virtual currencies cannot be treated like other stocks due to their complicated, digital nature and that there were no Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements established within the industry.\nIn November 2017, the former CFTC commissioner declared that bitcoin wasn\u2019t \u201ca scam of a fraud\u201d:\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s, you know, a fraud, like [JPMorgan Chase CEO] Jamie Dimon said, or a pyramid scheme like [Russian] President Putin says. I mean, people are actually using bitcoins to purchase things. So, that\u2019s not a scam or a fraud.\u201d", "birthday": "2019-05-01T10:04:00+01:00", "date": "2019-05-01 09:04:00", "year": 2019, "month": 5, "day": 1}

This is the narrative coming from the company after some changes in the last 10 days.\nFirstly, news broke last week that Coinbase had filed to close its Political Action Committee (PAC) with the American Federal Election Commission (FEC).\nA quick look at the filing and balance sheet shows that Coinbase\u2019s PAC did not receive any funding and made no payments in 2019.\nAccording to FEC regulations, a termination report needs to be filed by a PAC in order for it to close down. Part of those conditions need to show that the PAC has neither received nor intends to receive any contributions/make any payments.\nFollowing that, Coinbase confirmed that it had closed its Chicago office in a move to scale down its high-frequency trade matching engine.\nCointelegraph reached out to Coinbase for official comment on both matters and the company has confirmed that it is carrying out some changes to its business focus.\nWhat is a PAC?\nIn America, Political Action Committees are set up as independent organizations that collect funds that are then donated to political campaigns.\nCoinbase set up its PAC in July 2018 and subsequently became a founding member of the Blockchain Association in September. The group was the first to lobby for the interests of the blockchain industry in Washington, D.C.\nCoinbase was not the only benefactor, however, with other members including technology startup Protocol Labs, the Digital Currency Group and Polychain Capital.\nIn a reply to Cointelegraph, Coinbase Director of Communications Elliott Suthers would not divulge why the company had initially setup the PAC nor the main reason why it has now decided to shut down the group less than a year after it was initially created.\nCoinbase scaling down on trading focus?\nRecently, Coinbase also closed its Chicago office as part of scaledown of its high-frequency trade matching engine.\nInitial reports suggested that 30 employees would be laid off in the move, while others would be allowed to work remotely or be relocated to other offices.\nIt is understood that Coinbase is dialling down its focus on high-frequency trading as it looks to develop new product offerings.\nSuthers told Cointelegraph that the company is making a concerted effort to meet the needs of a growing number of institutions that are lining up to enter the crypto ecosystem:\n\u201cInstitutional is one of our fastest growing businesses and institutional customers are driving a lot of growth for us right now. We currently serve a broad spectrum of institutions from asset issuers and crypto funds at one end to university endowments and pension funds at the other.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nThe bull market of 2017 followed by the bust in 2018 increased the popularity of cryptocurrencies. 89% of Americans have heard of Bitcoin, up from 77% in October 2017, according to a new survey by Spencer Bogart of Blockchain Capital. Another encouraging sign is that every age group has been purchasing Bitcoin. The survey shows that even 2% of retirees own Bitcoin.\nThe executives of traditional financial institutions are increasingly joining the blockchain and crypto bandwagon. Even the large finance companies are looking at ways to introduce and improve crypto services for institutional investors.\nA report by research firm Gartner Inc shows that 20% of the top 10 grocers across the world will use blockchain by 2025. This shows the scale of growth in just a few years. The recent recovery is pointing to an end of the bear market. Most major cryptocurrencies are unlikely to drop to their lows. But are they showing any buy setups? Let\u2019s find out. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBTC/USD\nThe bulls have been defending the 20-day EMA for the past few days, but have been unable to propel Bitcoin (BTC) higher. This shows a lack of demand at higher levels as the digital currency nears the stiff resistance zone of $5,600\u2013$59,00. However, both the moving averages are trending up, which suggests that the bulls still hold the advantage. Above $5,400, the bulls will again try to carry the price to the overhead resistance zone.\n\nWe do not expect the BTC/USD pair to scale above the resistance zone at the first instance. A few days of consolidation or a minor correction from $5,900 is likely.\nThe RSI is forming a bearish divergence, which is a negative sign. If the pair turns around and dives below the 20-day EMA, it can fall to $4,914.11. A breakdown of the $4,914.11 and the 50-day SMA support zone will dampen sentiment and shift the advantage in favor of the bears. We suggest traders trail the stops on the remaining long positions to $5,100 and protect paper profits.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) has held the 50-day SMA. The subsequent bounce has carried it above the 20-day EMA and the overhead resistance at $167.20. However, it is facing resistance at the downtrend line.\n\nBoth the moving averages are flattening out and the RSI is close to the midpoint. This suggests a consolidation for the next few days.\nThis view will be invalidated if the ETH/USD pair breaks out of the downtrend line. It can then rise to $180, followed by a rally to $190.54. Above this level, it is likely to pick up momentum and head towards $225 and above it to $256. The pair will turn negative if it breaks below the recent lows of $148.03. We will wait for the price to sustain above the downtrend line before proposing a trade in it.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) is currently range bound between $0.27795 and $0.33108. The bounce on April 30 could not scale the 20-day EMA. This is a negative sign.\n\nThe bears will now try to sink the price back towards the low of $0.27795. A break of this level will revisit the yearly low of $0.24508. While the other cryptocurrencies are showing life and have moved further away from their lows, the XRP/USD pair is struggling to move up.\nThe pair will signal strength after it breaks out and sustains above $0.33108. It will pick up momentum above $0.38. We will wait for a bullish setup to form before suggesting a trade in it.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) rebounded sharply from the support at 50-day SMA on April 30 and climbed above the overhead resistance of $255. It is currently facing resistance at the 20-day EMA.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI has also risen close to 50. This suggests that the pair might remain range bound for a few days. While the lower boundary might be $227.70, the upper boundary is yet to be established.\nOur view will be invalidated if the BCH/USD pair turns down from the current levels and drops below $227.70. On the upside, the pair will face resistance at $335.62 and above it at $363.30.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) reversed direction on April 30 and broke out of the descending channel and the 50-day SMA. It, however, is facing resistance at $74.6054. The 20-day EMA is also located close by, hence, we anticipate a stiff opposition by the bears at this level.\n\nWith the 20-day EMA flattening out and the RSI close to 50, we expect the LTC/USD pair to remain range bound for a few days.\nOur neutral view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels and slips back into the channel. On the other hand, a breakout above $74.6054 will push the price towards $84.3439 and above it to $91.\nEOS/USD\nEOS bounced off the 50-day SMA on April 30. It is currently at the downtrend line, which is likely to offer resistance. The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is close to the center. This points to a probable consolidation in the short term.\n\nHowever, if the EOS/USD pair climbs above the downtrend line, it will become positive. The target levels to watch on the upside are $5.6163 and above it $6.0726. A breakout of this will propel the pair to the stiff resistance of $6.8299.\nThis bullish view will be negated if the price turns down from the current levels and plummets below the uptrend line of the rising wedge.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) has been trading just above the 20-day EMA for the past few days. Both the moving averages continue to trend up and the RSI is maintaining in the positive zone. This shows that the bulls still have the upper hand.\n\nHowever, the failure to push the price higher shows that the BNB/USD pair is not finding buying support at higher levels. But the traders holding long positions are not booking profits either, due to which the pair continues to trade close to the recent highs.\nThe first indication of selling will be when the digital currency slides and sustains below the 20-day EMA. A deeper correction will ensue if the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA. Until then, every dip is likely to be purchased. Though we are bullish, we do not spot a reliable buy setup, hence, we are not suggesting a trade in it.\nXLM/USD\nThough the bears broke down the uptrend line twice, they could not capitalize on the advantage. This shows buying at lower levels. The bulls have pushed the price close to the downtrend line, which is a positive sign. Stellar (XLM) is currently facing resistance at the 20-day EMA, above which a rally to $0.12039489 is possible.\n\nContrary to our assumption, if the XLM/USD pair turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to break down of the uptrend line once again. If the price sustains below this level, it will complete a rising wedge pattern that can drag the price lower to $0.08.\nBoth the moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is just below the midpoint. This suggests a range bound action for the next few days.\nADA/USD\nCardano (ADA) has pulled back to the moving averages. We expect it to face stiff resistance at this level, as the downtrend line is also located just above it. If the price turns down from the current levels, it can drop to $0.063230. A break of this level will turn the tables in favor of the bears.\n\nConversely, if the ADA/USD pair breaks out of the downtrend line, it can rally to $0.082952 and above it to $0.094256. If the pair fails to break out of this resistance zone, it might enter into a consolidation.", "birthday": "2019-05-01T19:21:00+01:00", "date": "2019-05-01 18:21:00", "year": 2019, "month": 5, "day": 1}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nTom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, believes that Bitcoin is in a bull market and it is likely to make a new high in 2020. Lee has based his views on a few signs that, according to him, point to the end of the bear market. Some of the important signs that Lee pointed out are the increase in trading volume buoyed by investors in Venezuela and Turkey, the breakout of Bitcoin above the 200-day moving average, and an increase in the number of OTC clients and the trading per client.\nThe fundamentals of altcoins are improving as well. Large organizations are exploring ways to use the blockchain technology to improve their services and productivity. The latest to opt for the technology is United Kingdom car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover, which will reward its drivers IOTA tokens for providing information on road conditions, traffic congestion and vehicle performance. Drivers can purportedly redeem their tokens for coffee or to pay road tolls.\nWhile the fundamentals are improving, the price might take some time to catch up. This has resulted in a few long-term crypto bulls facing huge losses during the bear phase. Hence, the traders must keep an eye on the price action before jumping in. Let\u2019s consult the charts and see if we spot any buy setups in major cryptocurrencies.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) is finding it difficult to stay above the 20-day EMA. This is a negative sign as it indicates a lack of buying at these levels. If this support breaks down, the digital currency can drop to the next critical support of $4,914.11. We expect a strong support at this level, but if this also crumbles, the next support is at the 50-day SMA.\n\nFor now, both the moving averages are trending up, which suggests that the bulls are still in the game. If the BTC/USD pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA or from the lower level of $4,914.11, it will again try to resume its up move to $5,600 and above it to $5,900. Traders can retain the stop loss of $4,800 on the remaining long positions. The next few days are very critical as it will set the stage for the next leg of the trending move.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) has been trading between the moving averages for the past three days. The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is just below the midpoint. This points to a consolidation in the short term. If the price remains close to $167.20, it will increase the possibility of a breakout from it.\n\nThe ETH/USD pair is likely to gain strength above the downtrend line and pick up momentum after crossing $190.54. The upside targets to keep in mind are $225 and above it $256.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below the 50-day SMA. If that happens, a drop to the trendline of the ascending triangle is probable. We will wait for the digital currency to show strength before suggesting a long position in it once again.\nXRP/USD\nThe bounce from the critical low of $0.27795 was tepid. It shows a lack of urgency among the buyers to own Ripple (XRP) even at these low levels. We now expect the bears to attempt a breakdown of the support once again. If successful, it can slide to the yearly low of $0.24508. Any break of this level will be a major sentiment spoiler.\n\nContrary to our assumption, if the XRP/USD pair rebounds from the current levels, it will point to a range bound action between $0.27795 and $0.33108 for a few days. The pair will show signs of strength if it breaks out of $0.33108 and will pick up momentum above $0.38. As it has been a huge underperformer for the past few months, we will wait for it to signal a turnaround before suggesting a trade in it.\nBCH/USD\nAfter holding the support at $255 for three days, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) broke below it on April 28. Its next support is the zone between $241.97 and the 50-day SMA. Any break of this zone will pull it lower to $209 and below it to $166.98, which will complete a 100% retracement of the recent rally.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is turning down and the RSI is in the negative territory. This suggests that the bears have the upper hand in the short term.\nIf the BCH/USD pair rebounds from the 50-day SMA, it can re-enter the range between $335.62 and $255. This will increase the probability of a consolidation for the next few days. We will wait for the pair to show strength before recommending a trade in it.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) has broken down of the 50-day SMA, which is a bearish sign. It can now drop to the next support at $62.450, below which it will weaken. The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover and the RSI is deep in the negative territory, which shows that the bears are in command.\n\nOur bearish view will be invalidated if the LTC/USD pair reverses direction and breaks out of the 20-day EMA. That will be the first sign that the pair is finding buyers. It can then move up to $84.3439 and above it to $91. We will wait for the price to break out of $91 before turning positive on it.\nEOS/USD\nEOS has been trading between both the moving averages for the past five days. The failure to scale above the 20-day EMA has attracted sellers and the price is currently back at the 50-day SMA.\n\nIf the bears sink the EOS/USD pair below the uptrend line of the wedge, it will complete a bearish pattern that has a target objective of $2.80. The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone. This shows that the bears have the upper hand.\nOur bearish view will be invalidated if the price rebounds off the current support at the 50-day SMA or the uptrend line and rises above the downtrend line. In such a case, a rally to $5.6163 and above it $6.0726 is probable. We will wait for the cryptocurrency to resume its up move before proposing a trade in it.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) continues to be in an uptrend. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory. This suggests that the bulls are still at an advantage. However, if the cryptocurrency plummets below the 20-day EMA, it can drop to the uptrend line. The 50-day SMA is just below this level. Hence, we anticipate a strong support in this zone.\n\nA breakdown of the wedge will complete a bearish pattern that can drag prices to $14. However, if the bulls defend the 20-day EMA, the BNB/USD pair will try to resume the uptrend. Currently, we do not find any reliable buy setups on the pair. Hence, we shall not suggest a trade in it.\nXLM/USD\nThe bulls are struggling to hold the uptrend line. If the bears sustain the price below the uptrend line, Stellar (XLM) will complete the breakdown of the rising wedge that can drag the price to $0.08 and lower. The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover, which is also a negative sign.\n\nThe XLM/USD pair will show a sign of strength if the bulls manage to push it above the moving averages and $0.12039489. Until then, every minor pullback will be sold into. We suggest traders avoid bottom fishing and wait for the price to stabilize and signal a trend reversal before jumping in.\nADA/USD", "birthday": "2019-04-29T19:39:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-29 18:39:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 29}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptokicks-what-we-know-about-nikes-potential-gateway-into-crypto", "title": " 'Cryptokicks': What We Know About Nike\u2019s Potential Gateway Into Crypto ", "content": "Nike, the United States footwear and clothing behemoth, has recently joined the ranks of mainstream corporations that are considering entering the field of cryptocurrencies, currently spearheaded by the likes of Facebook, Samsung and Starbucks.\nA document filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) surfaced online last week, revealing Nike\u2019s intention to launch \u201ccryptokicks\u201d \u2014 which appears to be more than just a new line of sneakers.\nWhat are \u201cCryptokicks\u201d?\nThe news about Nike\u2019s \u201ccryptokicks\u201d trademark was originally broken by Josh Gerben, a trademark attorney in the U.S. who first described the application via Twitter on April 24. The document itself, in turn, was filed with the USPTO on April 19.\nNotably, the corporation\u2019s filing mentions crypto wallets (both software and hardware), \u201cdownloadable mobile applications for providing access to crypto collectibles, crypto art and application tokens,\u201d as well as an online marketplace featuring footwear and clothing as potential use cases.\nFurthermore, the document also describes plans for \u201cproviding a digital currency or digital token for use by members of an online community,\u201d and enabling transactions to be completed using \u201cunconventional currency systems,\u201d which implies that Nike might integrate cryptocurrencies into its burgeoning online marketing \u2014 last month, the company reported its digital business brought in more than $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time, securing a whopping 36% rise from the same period a year ago. That would also fall in line with the company\u2019s chief business strategy, which puts an emphasis on its connection with consumers and features aggressive branding expansion via mobile apps and social media, among other things.\nIn the application, Nike also explains how it wants to reserve the \u201ccryptokicks\u201d name for providing \u201conline blogs in the field of crypto collectibles\u201d and offering online computer games, such as scavenger hunts, treasure hunts and obstacle courses. Similarly, the U.S. corporation applied for a trademark for \"footware,\" which a mashup of the words \"footwear\" and \"software,\" earlier last month.\nHow likely is Nike to release it?\nBut could it be a mere speculative move to stake a claim in the trademark amid the everlasting crypto hype? Andrew Hinkes, an adjunct professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and NYU School of Law and co-founder of Athena Blockchain, suggests that at least something might be brewing in the Nike\u2019s offices. \u201cThis does not mean definitively that anything will be launched anytime soon,\u201d he told Cointelegraph. \"However, there needs to be some sort of internal work happening at Nike for Nike to file its application.\u201d According to Hinkes, it is impossible to evaluate the progress at this point just by looking at the application:\n\u201cThe filer of a federal trademark must have a bona fide intent to use the mark in connection with the goods and services that are listed with the application. Bona fide intent can mean anything from \u2018they are looking into it\u2019 to \u2018they are well down the path to implementation\u2019 and anything in between.\u201d\nAccording to Gerben, the attorney who initially reported on the filing:\n\u201cNike does not have a history of filings that are speculative.\"\nHe described the document\u2019s content as \u201ctrademark speak for \u2018this is a cryptocurrency called Cryptokicks.\u2019\u201d\nWhen could \u201ccryptokicks\u201d be introduced to the market?", "birthday": "2019-04-29T18:41:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-29 17:41:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 29}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/celebrity-crypto-investments-a-boost-for-the-industry-but-also-a-distraction", "title": " Celebrity Crypto-Investments: A Boost for the Industry, but Also a Distraction ", "content": "Marketing loves celebrities \u2014 and with good reason. They're \u201ccelebrated\u201d people, individuals invested with bulk quantities of cultural capital (i.e., public respect, goodwill and interest), which \u2014 if tapped correctly by marketing firms \u2014 can be reflected onto endorsed products. This is why they've already proven important for the cryptocurrency industry, which has enlisted the likes of Lionel Messi, Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Steven Seagal for the purposes of drawing the public's attention toward initial coin offerings (ICOs) and new cryptocurrencies.\nBut while the above have simply been endorsements offered in return for what we can only presume were million-dollar fees, there are a number of other celebrities who support and have supported crypto more meaningfully. From Ashton Kutcher to Serena Williams, these are individuals who have actually bought crypto or invested in crypto-related startups. So instead of merely allowing their names and faces to be associated with altcoin X or exchange Y, they've provided an even stronger backing of crypto by actually putting skin in the game.\nHowever, as validating as it may be to hear of another celebrity staking their own money on the success of crypto, celebrity investments won't be enough on their own to drive widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies, since they still remain a relatively rare occurrence. Instead, the crypto industry and community still need to focus on the core fundamentals: building platforms that businesses and the general public actually want to use.\nVenture capitalist celebrities\nOn April 17, tennis champion Serena Williams became the latest celebrity investor in crypto. She revealed via her Instagram account that she\u2019d secretly launched an investment company, Serena Ventures, in 2014. And more importantly for the cryptocurrency industry, she also revealed that this company had invested in Coinbase, making her a backer of one of the industry's biggest players.\nIt's not known how much Serena Ventures has invested in America's biggest crypto exchange, although Williams has won nearly $90 million in prize money over the course of her career, while she earned around $18 million in endorsements between 2017 and 2018 alone. She therefore has fairly deep pockets, indicating that her investment in Coinbase could be substantial \u2014 if not monumental.\nWilliams isn't the only celebrity to have stumped up venture capital for a crypto-related company. Arguably the most active celebrity investor in such companies is Ashton Kutcher, the actor and one-time Calvin Klein model who launched his own venture capital firm \u2014 A-Grade Investments \u2014 in 2010. Most notably, he invested an undisclosed sum in crypto transaction processor BitPay in March 2013, while in June 2014, his firm participated in a $12 million funding round for blockchain cybersecurity company BitGo, making it one of the most well-funded crypto-related companies at the time.\nThese multiple investments indicate that Kutcher is a firm believer in cryptocurrency, as reinforced by his comments following the BitGo investment. \"People ultimately want to feel like their wealth is safe,\" he was quoted by Forbes as saying:\n\"Bitcoins themselves are incredibly secure, however the means by which bitcoins are exchanged and stored can be vulnerable. That is why BitGo is such an amazing platform.\"\nIndeed,\u00a0comments made about bitcoin at TechCrunch's Disrupt conference in 2013 show that Kutcher has been a cryptocurrency devotee for over half a decade \u2014 and in recent years, additional investments have reconfirmed his interest in crypto. In 2015, he launched a new venture capital firm, Sound Ventures, which later went on to invest in Ripple (and then to donate XRP worth $4 million to Ellen DeGeneres' wildlife charity in 2018). Sound Ventures has also invested an undeclared amount of money in exchange platform\u00a0Robinhood, which\u00a0expanded in February 2018 to offering cryptocurrency trading.\nKutcher may be the most committed and outspoken celebrity investor in cryptocurrencies and crypto-related businesses, but he isn't the only famous individual to be all-in when it comes to crypto. One other celebrity venture capitalist who flies slightly more under the radar is Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones, better known as the rapper \"Nas.\u201d Nas launched QueensBridge Venture Partners (QBVP) in 2014, when the firm\u00a0invested in Bitfury Group as part of a $20 million Series A investment round. QBVP has also invested in BlockCypher and, more recently, Coinbase and Robinhood, while Nas himself has gone on record as\u00a0saying that \"Bitcoin will evolve into an industry as big, if not bigger, than the internet.\"\nThe mention of Robinhood here is interesting, because it seems to be a magnet for investments from celebrity-led funds. Aside from Nas (and Ashton Kutcher), the exchange platform also received funding in 2014 from rapper Snoop Dogg and actor Jared Leto, while in early 2018 it also\u00a0benefited from funding from Jay-Z's Arrive Venture Capital. And speaking of celebrity overlaps in crypto-related investments, BitPay was on the receiving end of money not only from Ashton Kutcher, but also from famed investor/author/philanthropist Richard Branson, who took part in a $30 million Series A funding round in 2014.\nSuch forays into cryptocurrency funding may not be massively common in the celebrity world, but the fact that they are made by celebrities rather than \u201cordinary\u201d investors and entrepreneurs should provide some encouragement. That's because, in such cases, the investors concerned are highly public figures who aren't putting only their money on the line when they invest in Coinbase, Robinhood or BitPay, but also their reputations. What's more, as CryptoOracle CEO Lou Kerner told Cointelegraph, their reputations really help to drive wider interest in crypto, particularly if the investors concerned are genuinely enthusiastic about cryptocurrencies:\n\"Investment from a celebrity like Serena Williams often generates press, which has value, but it's pretty ephemeral. There are some celebrity investors, like Ashton Kutcher, that really dig in, leverage their celebrity status to help the company, and add real value.\"\nOther industry figures agree with this assessment. Artem Popov, the co-founder of blockchain-based investment service Roobee, also affirms that celebrity investments can boost public interest, so long as these investments come from individuals who are personally invested in the cryptocurrency space:\n\"Celebrity investments certainly bring hype and make the startup in question more appealing in the eyes of the general public and retail investors. If played right, celebrity involvement can be beneficial, but I believe it should be viewed on case-by-case basis and not taken out of context. For instance, in the case of Serena Williams we're not talking about her directly supporting blockchain or Coinbase.\"\nCelebrity crypto ownership\nAs Lou Kerner adds, such celebrities as Ashton Kutcher and Nas are \"the exception rather than the rule,\" since most of the celebrities who do associate themselves with crypto do so more in terms of superficial marketing endorsements. And there have been no shortage of these in recent years:\u00a0Paris Hilton, Floyd Mayweather, DJ Khaled, Steven Seagal, The Game, T.I, Harry Redknapp, Ghostface Killah, Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Akon, Dennis Rodman and Shahbaz Khan have all rented their names out to cryptocurrency projects of one stripe or another. And what's interesting to note about such endorsements is that they were all for projects that were either likely to fail or downright fraudulent.\nIn other words, the distinction between celebrity investments and celebrity endorsements provides a useful rule of thumb. Generally, a celebrity will invest their own money in a crypto-related project because they really believe it offers value and will succeed as a business proposition. However, their willingness to be paid for their \u201cendorsement\u201d of a project obviously has no bearing on whether they believe in it, since they will get paid regardless of its success. It's for this reason that individual investors and traders would be better off paying more attention to investments than to endorsements.\nBut even if the number of celebrities who have actually invested in crypto projects can probably be counted on a few hands, there are also a number of celebrities who, rather than getting involved specifically in venture capitalism, have sought to invest in bitcoin, ether or some other cryptocurrency for their own personal advantage. These include the likes of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, actor Hugh Laurie, rappers 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg, singer Mel B, actor Drew Carey, football player Richard Sherman and musician/actor Donald Glover.\nOnce again, that such people are public figures with thousands or millions of admirers is largely a good thing for cryptocurrency, since their enthusiasm for crypto is likely to rub off onto their fans. As Diego Mourad, CEO of the decentralized stolen item-database S4FE, explained:\n\"People tend to form their opinions and decisions based on their role models, which today are celebrities and not necessarily politicians, scientists or academics. Celebrities have followers, sometimes millions of them. So by just one celebrity turning their attention to cryptocurrencies, millions may be encouraged to look into that topic.\"", "birthday": "2019-04-29T05:04:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-29 04:04:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 29}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data provided by HitBTC exchange.\nAltcoins led the rally this week from the lows with bitcoin (BTC) lagging behind. After a sharp up move, it was natural for traders to book profits on their quick gains. While altcoins have pulled back sharply from their recent highs, bitcoin has held up quite well. Its dominance has gradually inched from about 50% in early-April to 54.5%.\nDuring times of crisis in the industry, investors usually take refuge in bitcoin. Following the recently reported scandal involving crypto exchange Bitfinex and stablecoin tether (USDT), traders have converted their tether into bitcoin. Though both firms have issued a joint statement denying any wrongdoing, investors are playing it safe.\nSuch events give an opportunity to traditional brokerages to enter the nascent space as they offer a trusted relationship to their clients. The latest to take the plunge is online trading firm E*Trade Financial Group as it reportedly readies to offer cryptocurrency trading in BTC and ether (ETH) on its platform. E*Trade had 4.9 million brokerage accounts on Dec. 31 of last year. With such a massive reach, the move would be an important one for cryptocurrency adoption.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin completed a bullish crossover this week for the first time since October 2015. This move arguably indicates a trend reversal. The bear market has seen a lot of investors lose huge sums of money. One among them was a seasoned investor, Japanese billionaire and founder of multinational conglomerate SoftBank Group, Masayoshi Son who booked a loss of about $130 million trading bitcoin.\nWhile many consider bitcoin to be digital gold, a recent survey in Europe found that only 49% of respondents believe that BTC will be around 10 years from now. This shows that cryptocurrencies will have to evolve further to be accessible and friendly to the non-tech savvy public.\n\nThe BTC/USD pair has largely stayed above the breakout level of $4,914.11 for the past three weeks. But the bulls are struggling to push the price to the next overhead resistance of $5,900.\nCurrently, the 50-week SMA is acting as a resistance. If the bulls defend the $4,914.11 levels again during the next fall, it will indicate buying at lower levels and the pair might remain range bound for a few more weeks. Consolidation at these levels is a positive sign.\nBut if the price rebounds sharply from the current levels or from $4,914.11, the cryptocurrency could rally to $5,900. We anticipate a stiff resistance at this level. \u00a0\nOn the downside, if the bears sink the pair below $4,914.11, it can drop to the 20-week EMA and below it to $4,255.\nThe next couple of weeks are very important as it will set the stage for the next leg of the move.\nXEM/USD\nWhen all the top 20 coins are in the red, it shows that the markets are at a risk of turning down. Nem (XEM) was the second-best performer this week as it fell by about 9% in the past seven days. What is in store? Can it stage a recovery or will it continue to slide further? Let us find out.\n\nThe recovery in the XEM/USD pair hit a roadblock at the overhead resistance of $0.07790717. The price has been correcting for the past three weeks. The bulls will attempt to defend the support at $0.060 and below it $0.053. If these supports breakdown, a retest of the lows is probable.\nOn the other hand, if the pair rebounds from $0.060, the bulls will again try to propel it above the overhead resistance of $0.07790717. If successful, it can move up to the 50-week SMA at $0.10 and above it to $0.13. The cryptocurrency is yet to form a reversal setup. We shall wait for it to show some strength before turning positive on it.\nBSV/USD\nBitcoin SV (BSV) has been in the news for the past few days as a few exchanges delisted it. After the initial plunge, prices seem to be stabilizing. The delisting put it and its creator, Craig Wright, in the limelight. Ayr United, a football team in Scotland, has signed a sponsorship that will feature the bitcoin SV logo on its shirts.\n\nThe BSV/USD pair had been trading inside a range of $102.580 and $58.072 for the past few weeks. It turned down from the top of the range three weeks back and since then has been facing strong selling due to the negative news surrounding it.\nThe bears broke below the support of the range at $58.072 and continued lower. Currently, the bulls are attempting to rebound from the psychological support of $50. If the bulls carry the price back into the range, we can expect the pair to consolidate between $58.072 and $102.580 for the next few weeks.\nBut if the bulls fail to ascend above $58.072, the bears will again try to breakdown the support at $50. If that happens, a retest of the lows at $38.528 is possible.\nETH/USD\nThe co-founder of Ethereum has proposed increasing Ether staking rewards once the protocol switches to Proof of Stake (PoS). Meanwhile, Ethereum developers this week announced that they had raised the required funding for a third-party audit of the ProgPoW code.\nIn other news, reports recently surfaced that Samsung plans to develop a public-private blockchain based on Ethereum. The token is likely to be named Samsung Coin.\nSociete Generale SFH \u2014 a subsidiary of Societe Generale Group \u2014 issued a 100 million euro bond on the Ethereum blockchain.\nIn a negative development, a hacker managed to siphon off about 45,000 ether by successfully guessing weak private keys.\n\nThe ETH/USD pair has slipped back below the breakout level of $167.32, which is a negative sign. It invalidates the bullish breakout of the ascending triangle pattern. The next support on the downside is $144.78. If this also breaks, the drop could extend to the trendline of the ascending triangle.\nHowever, if the pair rebounds off the support at $144.78, the bulls will again try to scale above $167.32. If successful, the next overhead resistance is $187.98. If this level is crossed, the pair is likely to pick up momentum and quickly rally to its target objective of $251.64. As it has formed a reversal pattern at the bottom, this target price might even be crossed.", "birthday": "2019-04-28T22:53:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-28 21:53:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 28}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nWhile various cryptocurrencies are vying to attract investors attention, stablecoins have silently gained popularity. Currently, most stablecoins are pegged to the U.S. dollar. United Kingdom-based cryptocurrency payment processor Wirex has announced plans to launch stablecoins pegged to various fiat currencies. This, according to them, will allow \u201cfor swift, international remittance without the need for local liquidity providers.\u201d\nMany projects are focused on ironing out issues in cross-border payments using blockchain technology. A prominent name among them is JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which has been able to attract more than 220 banks across the globe to its Interbank Information Network (IIN). JPM is working towards a quick resolution of the problems associated with international payments that get stuck.\nAround 20 of the biggest traders in the crypto market met in January to discuss the steps needed to make the asset class more attractive to institutional investors. The next leg of growth will need the involvement of institutional players, but some institutions are still skeptical due to the stigma attached to the asset class. However, if cryptocurrencies show a sustained recovery, many will be forced to take the plunge.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) is facing selling on a rebound from the 20-day EMA. This suggests profit booking by the bulls and probable short initiation by the bears. If the price slides below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate weakness and a fall to $4,914.11 will be on the cards. This is a major support. If this breaks down, the next stop is the 50-day SMA.\n\nIf the bulls defend the support zone between the 20-day EMA and $4,914.11, the BTC/USD pair will again try to resume its up move. The levels to watch on the upside are $5,600 and above it $5,900. We expect a strong resistance in this overhead zone. Hence, we recommended closing partial positions above $5,600 in our previous analysis.\nUntil then, the stop loss on the remaining long positions can be kept at $4,800. The pair is giving mixed signals. While the uptrending moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory are bullish, the developing negative divergence on the RSI is a red flag. The next few days are critical for the leading digital currency.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) plunged below the 50-day SMA on April 25 and hit our stop loss on the remaining long positions at $150. Nonetheless, we like the way the bulls are attempting to bounce off the 50-day SMA. If they succeed in propelling the price back above $167.32, it will indicate that the current fall was a bear trap.\n\nBut if the ETH/USD pair fails to scale above $167.32, the bears will again try to break down of the 50-day SMA. If successful, the pair can decline to $144.78 and below it a drop to the trendline of the ascending triangle pattern is probable.\nThe 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI has dipped below 50. This suggests that the bears are staging a comeback. We will wait for the price to sustain above $167.32 before turning positive once again.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) has plummeted back into the channel and has dropped to the critical support of $0.27795. If this support breaks down, the next stop is the retest of the yearly low at $0.24508.\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the RSI is close to the oversold levels. Though these are negative signals, we will disregard them because the XRP/USD pair is range bound.\nThe best way to trade in a range is to buy close to the bottom and sell at the resistance, but we suggest traders avoid buying now because the pair has been a huge underperformer in the past few days. This suggests a lack of buying interest.\nOur bearish bias will prove to be incorrect if the digital currency bounces off sharply from the current levels and rises above the channel once again. We do not find any reliable buy setups at the current levels.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is trying to hold the critical support zone between $255 and $241.97. If this zone breaks down a fall to the 50-day SMA is probable. Below this level, the digital currency can complete a 100% retracement of the recent rally.\n\nIf the bulls defend the support zone and secure a strong bounce from it, the BCH/USD pair might remain range bound for a few days. The pair is at a critical level. As the pair has a history of vertical rallies and waterfall declines, we will wait for a buy setup to form before suggesting a long position in it.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) has been taking support at the 50-day SMA for the past two days. Both the moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is just below the midpoint. This points to a consolidation in the near term.\n\nCurrently, the bears are facing selling at the 20-day EMA and the resistance line of the descending channel. If the LTC/USD pair breaks out of the channel, it can move up to $84.3439 and above it to $91.\nOn the contrary, if the bears sink the pair below the 50-day SMA, it can drop to $62.450. A breakdown of this support will turn the tide in favor of the bears. We will wait for the digital currency to form a bullish setup before suggesting a long position.\nEOS/USD\nEOS is trying to take support at the 50-day SMA. The uptrend line of the rising wedge and the horizontal support of $4.4930 are also just below this level. Hence, we expect a strong defense by the bulls.\n\nHowever, the 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is in the negative territory, which shows that the bears are back in action. A breakdown of the wedge will be bearish and it has a pattern target of $2.80.\nOn the upside, a breakout of the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line will indicate strength. The targets on the upside are $5.6163 and above it $6.0726. We shall wait for the EOS/USD pair to sustain above the downtrend line before turning positive.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) is in a strong uptrend. It has again bounced off the 20-day EMA, which shows that the buyers are keen to support it on any dip. The bulls will again try to make a new high. On the previous three occasions, the price turned down from the resistance line. Hence, this is a major resistance to watch out for. If the cryptocurrency breaks out of the wedge, it will invalidate a bearish pattern, which is a bullish sign.\n\nBut if the BNB/USD pair fails to rise to new highs or sustain it, the bears will again try to pull it back to the 20-day EMA. The pair remains strong as long as it stays above the uptrend line of the wedge. A breakdown of the wedge will be the first warning that a deeper correction is likely.\nFor now, both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is also in the positive territory. This suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside. We will wait for the price to sustain new highs before suggesting a long position.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) broke below the uptrend line of the rising wedge pattern on April 25. This is a negative sign but the bulls are making an attempt to push the price back into the wedge. On the upside, they will face a stiff resistance at the moving averages and above it at $0.12039489.\n\nIf the XLM/USD pair fails to sustain above the uptrend line, it might turn down once again and break below the wedge. This will give it an immediate target of $0.080. The moving averages are on the verge of completing a bearish crossover, which shows that the bears are in command. We suggest traders wait for the pair to show some strength before initiating any long positions.\nADA/USD\nCardano (ADA) continues to trade inside the descending channel. It has dipped to the 50-day SMA, which is a strong support. Though the bulls have managed to hold on to this level, they have not been able to secure a bounce. This shows a lack of urgency to buy at these levels.", "birthday": "2019-04-26T19:16:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-26 18:16:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 26}

Launched in December 2017 as an ERC-20 token, it's pegged 1:1 with the United States dollar, with its peg being maintained via over-collateralization with ether (ETH). In other words, users receive the equivalent of $1 in DAI by depositing more than $1 in ETH, and they can later reclaim their collateral by repaying the DAI they've received plus a \u201cstability fee\u201d in MKR, MakerDAO's other (nonstablecoin) token. By charging users this additional fee, the MakerDAO system theoretically prevents the value of DAI from dropping below $1, since the fee makes it expensive to mint more DAI tokens.\nHowever, as elegant as this system is in theory, it recently hasn't been working quite as well as intended. DAI has been below $1 for much of 2019 and has even dropped under $0.95 on a couple of occasions. MakerDAO users have therefore voted to increase the stability fee on five separate occasions this year, with the most recent vote on April 11 deciding that the fee will rise to 11.5% per year.\nBut even with this hike, the MakerDAO community isn't sure that the value of DAI won't keep fluctuating until more substantial and longer-term solutions are implemented. Despite the infighting that has occurred recently regarding MakerDAO governance and transparency, it is nonetheless hopeful that such solutions will be found and agreed upon, and that DAI will become the \u201cdefault stablecoin\u201d for the wider cryptocurrency community.\nPeople are buying DAI to go long on ETH\nAs the chart below illustrates, DAI hasn't quite stuck rigidly to its $1 pegging. For its entire (albeit short) life, its value has fluctuated consistently around the $1 level, and since the end of March, it has stubbornly hung below its intended price.\n\nAnd as Steven Becker, the president and chief operating officer of MakerDAO, told Cointelegraph, this variation is largely the product of one of the most basic economic forces: supply and demand.\n\"The price has hovered below $1 simply because the supply has outpaced the demand for Dai. As a result, the MakerDAO community has been increasing the Stability Fee in order to incentivize CDP owners to close out their positions and thus reduce the supply.\"\nFor those who aren't familiar with the inner workings of MakerDAO, \"CDP\" stands for collateralized debt position. This is what MakerDAO users open whenever they deposit some ETH \u2014 the collateral \u2014 and receive DAI tokens in return. As the holder of CDPs, they're subject to a percentage-based stability fee, which accumulates each year. And because it accumulates each year, it incentivizes holders to return their DAI, thereby keeping supply low and the price stable.\nOf course, matters are complicated by the use of ETH as collateral, which means that MakerDAO users are effectively going long on ETH when they open a CDP. What this means is that CDP owners can borrow DAI in order to purchase additional ETH (additional to the ETH they used to open the CDP), and if ether increases in price, more users will want to do this, since they will come out ahead \u2014 in comparison with simply buying ether with, say, U.S. dollars.\nAnd in fact, DAI's failure to reach its peg has been exacerbated not only by the gradual improvement in ether's price since late January, but also by the post-April 2 bull market, when ETH (among other cryptos) increased by over 16% in a single day. Because ETH has been rising so spectacularly as of late, more traders have wanted to open CDP positions and use DAI to buy more of the other cryptocurrency (i.e., ETH). At the same time, because the value of DAI sticks \u2014 more or less \u2014 within the $0.98-$1.02 range, demand for DAI in and of itself hasn't risen. And as Lawson Baker, head of special projects at Tokensoft and a participant in recent MakerDAO community calls, explained, this has created a supply-demand imbalance.\n\"Over the past few months, DAI has been struggling to maintain its peg to the US dollar given demand for MakerDAO loans exceeds the demand for the DAI created by when those loans are issued.\"\nSo, in order to address this imbalance and make its stablecoin more, well, stable, MakerDAO has voted to increase the stability fee on five separate occasions this year. In theory, this will make it less profitable for users to open CDPs. That said, as of writing, DAI is still valued at $0.97, while the community is already voting on yet another fee rise. At the same time, any further spikes in the price of ETH might continue to make such increases irrelevant.\nLonger-term solutions\nAnd given this constant to-and-fro, other figures within the stablecoin arena are questioning the use of a stability fee as a pegging mechanism. \u201cThe way I see it, trying to forcefully stabilize a coin and putting users in the line of fire by paying the \u2018stability fee\u2019 is a strange practice,\u201d argues Jeremy Dahan, the founder and CEO of DiamDEXX, a company that produces the diamond-backed stablecoin DIAM.\nUnsurprisingly, Dahan claims that pegging the coin to a stable asset would be a more reliable mechanism. But needless to say, this isn\u2019t really an option for MakerDAO, so the question remains as to what can be achieved in the longer term to ensure the constancy of the MakerDAO system. Indeed, MakerDAO admitted in a blog post from April 11 that previous hikes have been ineffective, implying that even the latest one may not be enough as it is:\n\"In February, the Stability Fee was increased twice, each time by 0.5%. In March, the Fee was raised by an additional 2%, and then by 4% two weeks later. The impact of these combined increases was insufficient to restore the peg, indicating that the appropriate rate is still higher.\"\nSolutions that go beyond a simple fee increase remain controversial, yet the MakerDAO community appears to be gravitating toward a multi-pronged attack that combines fee adjustment with some kind of means for boosting DAI demand and for limiting DAI supply.\n\"The are four ways to fix this problem,\" Baker explained. \"(1) increase the interest rate on a MakerDAO loan, (2) find ways to increase DAI usage and as a result demand for DAI, (3) limit the supply of DAI that can be created (i.e. this functions as a MakerDAO debt ceiling for loans akin to the U.S. government\u2019s debt ceiling, or (4) a combination of all three.\"\nEven though he doesn't offer specific ways of boosting DAI usage, Baker nonetheless affirms that \"a combination of all three is the best long term approach.\" Such a combination may indeed have the best chance of gaining wider community support, something that will be vital if MakerDAO is to solve its stability issues, since Becker told Cointelegraph that the MakerDAO Foundation can't itself do such things as lower the debt ceiling.\n\"The Maker Foundation cannot make any decisions related to the debt ceiling. That responsibility lies with MKR holders. The MakerDAO community could consider any solution that follows the principles of Decentralized Scientific Governance (If ideas are supported by the appropriate models and data, they are discussed by the MakerDAO community in a variety of social media platforms, including the weekly governance call.\"", "birthday": "2019-04-26T19:57:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-26 18:57:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 26}

At least $90 million worth of assets had left the Bitifinex wallets once the accusations were aired, while tether\u2019s USDT peg remains almost unshaken.\nDoes the New York regulator have the legal rights to prosecute Bitfinex?\nOn April 25, the New York Attorney General\u2019s (NYAG) office announced it was investigating iFinex Inc., the company that operates both Bitifinex and Tether. In the accompanying statement, Attorney General Letitia James accused the cryptocurrency exchange of losing $850 million and subsequently taking funds from Tether\u2019s reserves to secretly cover the shortage.\nMoreover, the state\u2019s top prosecutor revealed that her office obtained a court filing alleging that iFinex and its associated entities were in violation of New York law in connection with activities that may have defrauded New York-based crypto investors. James stated:\n\u201cOur investigation has determined that the operators of the \u2018Bitfinex\u2019 trading platform, who also control the \u2018tether\u2019 virtual currency, have engaged in a cover-up to hide the apparent loss of $850 million dollars of co-mingled client and corporate funds. New York state has led the way in requiring virtual currency businesses to operate according to the law. And we will continue to stand-up for investors and seek justice on their behalf when misled or cheated by any of these companies.\u201d\nAs per the court documents filed by Assistant Attorney General Brian Whitehurst, although iFinex is registered in the British Virgin Islands, it deals with some clients that are based in New York. Whitehurst subsequently highlights that neither Bitfinex nor Tether are licensed by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to engage in virtual currency business in the state, while the agency \u201chas promulgated regulations\u201d within that field.\nSelva Ozelli, international tax attorney and CPA, explained to Cointelegraph that the New York attorney general has jurisdiction over offshore matters under New York's Martin Act. According to Ozelli, the agency\u2019s interest in cryptocurrencies might have arisen in September 2018, when the OAG published its Virtual Markets Integrity Initiative Report, which set forth the findings by the office about the practices of \u201cvirtual asset trading platforms\u201d that operate \u2014 or were believed to operate \u2014 in New York. Among the findings, she says that the OAG highlighted the \u201csubstantial potential for conflicts between the interests of the platform, platform insiders, and platform customers.\u201d She also added:\n\u201cAn offshore company like Bitfinex could carry on of a U.S. trade or business depending on the nature and extent of its economic activities in New York which must go beyond a single isolated act or transaction and involve considerable, continuous, and regular activity.\"\nAndrew Rossow, an attorney and law professor, also believes that the New York attorney general should have enough juridical power to get involved despite the fact that neither Bitfinex nor Tether is based in New York or has a BitLicense to operate there. He told Cointelegraph:\n\u201cThere are two sources of law that allow for the New York Attorney General to get involved.\nFirst, NYAG does have power as there is arguably a strong case for jurisdiction here. Under the law, the minimum contacts standard is used for determining whether jurisdiction exists.\u201d\nRossow develops: \u201cIn this case, the NY AG believes that because Bitfinex is specifically availing itself to individual investors in New York, by means of allowing NY-based individuals to deposit, trade, and withdraw digital currencies, as well as engage in other transactions, there is sufficient contact within the State of New York to establish that jurisdiction. Therefore, with respect to protecting \u2018its own,\u2019 in this case, NY investors, the NYAG does in fact have power here.\n\u201cSecond, the NYAG can invoke the \u2018Martin Act,\u2019 which broadly empowers the NYAG to conduct civil and criminal investigations for securities law violations. New York is a state that has demonstrated its leadership in this digital currency space, and therefore, has one of the most stringent state laws with respect to it. Obviously, with Wyoming\u2019s Token Taxonomy Act (TTA), we have another powerful force on the field.\u201d\nCaitlin Long, the co-founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition with previous experience of working for Wall Street banks, argued that the OAG showed double standards by using the Martin Act for the iFinex case while holding back when Merrill Lynch was doing something \u201cquite similar\u201d during the 2009-2012 period:\n7/ So...#NewYork did good investigative work here but needs to be called to task on why the double standard, and why the \"gotcha\" approach? Why not do the same to #WallSt firms when they play similar shell games???\u2014 Caitlin Long \ud83d\udd11 (@CaitlinLong_) April 26, 2019\n\nCointelegraph has contacted Long for further comment, but has not received a reply as of press time.\nThe filings detail how the Office of the Attorney General started investigating Bitfinex and Tether in 2018\nAs part of the probe, the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) requested information from third-party entities, including banks and audit firms, that have allegedly been involved in business with iFinex. By November 2018, the counsels for Bitfinex and Tether \u2014 jointly represented by the law firms Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP and Steptoe & Johnson LLP \u2014 had reportedly found out about the investigation and contacted the OAG on behalf of their clients.\nOn Nov. 21, 2018 the companies\u2019 lawyers and the OAG discussed the case for the first time via email. The representatives of Bitfinex and Tether reportedly said they would provide documents and information to the OAG if the corresponding subpoenas were served. On Nov. 27, the OAG allegedly presented the subpoenas. The lawyers of Bitfinex then accepted the writ and began producing documents.\nThree months later, on Feb. 21, the OAG and the counsels for Bitfinex and Tether held a meeting to discuss the investigation in person. At the meeting, Whitehurst claims, the representatives of the crypto companies explained to the OAG that Bitfinex has \u201chad a succession of unsuccessful banking relationships around the world over the past several years\u201d because many financial institutions have been reluctant to do business with \u201cunregulated or off-shore companies\u201d involved in cryptocurrencies.\nSpecifically, as per the court document, prior to 2017, Bitfinex and Tether \u201chad used several Taiwan-based banks to make and receive wire transfers to fulfill client orders for U.S. dollars. and for other purposes,\u201d with Wells Fargo acting as the correspondent bank. In March 2017, Wells Fargo allegedly declined to process U.S. dollar transfers from Bitfinex and Tether accounts. The companies were therefore forced to quickly find alternative arrangements, which is why they filed (but soon withdrew) a lawsuit against Wells Fargo, arguing that the bank\u2019s decision \"presented an existential threat to their business.\"\nIn November 2018, Tether publicly announced establishing a banking relationship with Deltec Bank & Trust Limited, a Bahamas-headquartered entity. In the same statement, Tether also claimed that \"USDT in the market are fully backed by US dollars that are safely deposited in our bank accounts.\"\nHowever, the prosecutors argue that Bitfinex never publicly disclosed its relationship with a Panama-based firm called Crypto Capital Corp., which supposedly started as early as 2014.\nAccording to Whitehurst, Crypto Capital acted as a \u201cpayment processor\u201d for Bitfinex and Tether, handling over $1 billion of its commingled customer and corporate funds, however \u201cno contract or similar written agreement was ever entered into between Crypto Capital and Bitfinex or Tether.\u201d Other \u201cpayment processors\u201d reportedly included \u201cfriends\" of Bitfinex, which the OAG describes as \u201chuman being friends of Bitfinex employees that were willing to use their bank accounts to transfer money to Bitfinex clients who had requested withdrawals.\u201d As per the court document, prosecutors believe that the crypto exchange used the services of those payment processors because it had no reliable bank to work with.\nNotably, the court filings feature alleged communication logs covering the period of April 2018 to\u00a0early 2019 between a senior Bitfinex executive (\"Merlin\") and an individual at Crypto Capital (\"Oz\"), which were allegedly produced for the OAG by the attorneys of Bitfinex and Tether.\nAccording to the enclosed conversation, Bitfinex was experiencing severe problems with its clients\u2019 withdrawals requests, as the crypto exchange essentially had no money to foster to them.\nThus, Whithurst writes that in October 2018, rumors began circulating online that Bitfinex clients were unable to withdraw their money. The same month, the crypto platform published a number of public statements suggesting that such hearsay was \"a targeted campaign based on nothing but fiction.\" Specifically, on Oct. 15, 2018, Bitfinex announced that \u201call cryptocurrency and fiat withdrawals are, and have been, processing as usual without the slightest interference.\u201d According to the OAG, \u201cthat was untrue,\u201d because on the same day, the senior Bitfinex executive (\"Merlin\") supposedly wrote to his contact at Crypto Capital that \u201ctoo many withdrawals waiting for a long time,\u201d which is why he urgently needed the money from Crypto Capital, \u201cin Tether or any other form.\u201d\n\u201cPlease understand all this could be extremely dangerous for everybody, the entire crypto community,\u201d Merlin reportedly said.\n\u201cBTC could tank to below 1k if we don\u2019t act quickly.\u201d\nIndeed, as Cointelegraph wrote around the time, Bitfinex had to temporarily halt fiat deposits in four fiat currencies \u2014 euro, U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and British pound \u2014 without specifying a reason for the suspension.\nAccording to the documents cited by the investigators, at some point, an unidentified Crypto Capital representative explained to the senior Bitfinex executive that $851 million could not be returned to the crypto exchange because it had been seized by governmental authorities in Portugal, Poland and the U.S. Bitfinex and Tether lawyers reportedly told the OAG that their clients do not believe that the money had actually been confiscated. \u00a0\n\u201cLine of credit\u201d: how Bitfinex (allegedly) used Tether\u2019s reserves\nAt the same meeting in February, Whitehurst writes, the lawyers of Bitfinex and Tether said that their clients \u201cwere in the process of contemplating a transaction that would permit Bitfinex to draw upon Tether's cash reserves on an as-needed basis\u201d in order to cover the missing $851 million.\nSpecifically, the filing states, the counsels explained that Bitfinex would take a \"line of credit\" of $600 to $700 million on the reserve funds backing tether. When asked by the OAG whether such a transaction would represent a conflict of interest given that Bitfinex and Tether are owned and operated by the same people, the lawyers reportedly described the planned deal as \"arm's length.\" That \u201craised serious questions about the viability of Bitfinex as an ongoing concern, the possibility that Tether's cash reserves would be dissipated and unrecoverable, and whether Bitfinex and Tether have misled their clients,\u201d Whitehurst writes in the document.\nSoon after the meeting took place, the prosecutors allegedly requested Bitfinex and Tether to provide more information on the contemplated transaction before March 7. Three days prior to that deadline, the companies\u2019 representatives allegedly told the OAG that it was not possible to get this information in time. On March 11, and then on March 19, the respondents finally forwarded documents that, according to the OAG, turned out to be either blog posts by Bitfinex and Tether that had already been posted online or other information that was not relevant to the aforementioned \u201cline of credit\u201d transaction.\nOn March 29, the representatives of Bitfinex and Tether purportedly informed the OAG that the transaction had already taken place two days before. As per the document, they also described a previously undisclosed transfer of $625 million from Tether's reserves to Bitfinex that allegedly took place in November 2018:\n\u201cDuring November 2018, Tether transferred $625 million held in its account at Deltec to Bitfinex\u2019s account at Deltec. Bitfinex, in turn, caused a total of $625 million to be transferred from Bitfinex\u2019s account at Crypto Capital to Tether\u2019s account at Crypto Capital, through a ledger entry at Crypto Capital crediting Tether\u2019s account in the amount of $625 million and debiting Bitfinex\u2019s account by a corresponding amount. The purpose of this exchange was to allow Bitfinex to address liquidity issues unrelated to tethers.\u201d\nNeither deal had been disclosed to investors or customers, the prosecutors stress.\nTherefore, the OAG's ongoing investigation aims \u201cto determine, among other things, the extent\u00a0to which New York investors are exposed to ongoing fraud being carried out by Bitfinex and\nTether.\u201d\nNow, the court has reportedly ordered the operators of the companies to immediately cease the dissipation of the U.S. dollars that back tether tokens and to produce investigation-related information and documents. The ruling also prohibits the companies from destroying potentially related documents.\nIt is still unclear whether the missing funds belong to the company\nAccording to Zhao Dong, one of Bitfinex\u2019s shareholders, all of the missing funds might exclusively belong to customers, despite the OAG saying that both corporate and client assets represent the $850 million shortage. Dong reportedly said:\n\u201cWhat the information I have right now is there are no losses, but the funds belong to clients. If the U.S. government seized the funds, they should know, the funds doesn\u2019t belong to Bitfinex or Tether, it\u2019s the clients\u2019 money.\u201d\nMoreover, Dong disclosed his conversation with Giancarlo Devasini, Bitfinex\u2019s chief financial officer, who allegedly assured him that the situation is fixable and that the exchange needs \u201ca few weeks and the funds will be unfrozen.\u201d He continued:\n\u201cThe funds were in several banks in Poland, [the] U.S. and Portugal, so I\u2019m not sure but that\u2019s what I heard.\u201d\niFinex\u2019s reaction: denial\nOn April 26, the same day the allegations were made public by the prosecutors, iFinex issued a response. In it, the head company controlling Bitfinex and Tether claimed that \u201cthe New York Attorney General\u2019s court filings were written in bad faith and are riddled with false assertions.\u201d\n\u201cWe have been informed that these Crypto Capital amounts are not lost but have been, in fact, seized and safeguarded. We are and have been actively working to exercise our rights and remedies and get those funds released. Sadly, the New York Attorney General\u2019s office seems to be intent on undermining those efforts to the detriment of our customers,\u201d the statement reads.\nMoreover, iFinex stressed that Bitfinex and Tether, who are \u201cfinancially strong,\u201d have been \u201cfully cooperative\u201d with the New York attorney general\u2019s office, \u201cas both companies are with all regulators.\u201d The conglomerate also said it is going to challenge this and further actions of the prosecutors.\nThere has been no public comment from iFinex since then apart from a comment made on the Bitfinex subreddit by one of its moderators, who thanked those who supported the exchange and claimed that the iFinex CEO Jean Louis van der Velde has sent letters \u201cto each and every one of you [Bitfinex clients].\u201d\nThe content of that letter to users \u2014 in fact sent today, April 27, and seen by Cointelegraph \u2014 reiterates IFinex\u2019s claim that the regulator\u2019s allegations are false and that the company will challenge them. The iFinex CEO wrote:\n\u201cI am here to tell you that we are good actors in the digital token space. We continue to co-operate with regulators worldwide as they seek to learn more about our business.\u201d\nCointelegraph has contacted Bitfinex and Crypto Capital and will update this article if more information is obtained from them.\nOther reactions: Bitfinex and customers withdraw funds from the platform\nIn what could be seen as an additional reaction to the allegations, on April 26, Bitfinex reportedly withdrew funds worth almost $90 million from its cold wallet. According to reports from online transaction monitoring resource Whale Alert, those were mostly bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) assets.\nMoreover, on April 25, soon before the allegations were aired, Redditor u/jankeldidi drew attention to the fact that about 550 BTC from addresses connected to the 2016 Bitfinex hack were moved to unknown addresses. In August 2016, the hackers used a bug in the exchange\u2019s multisignature system and withdrew about 120,000 BTC from Bitfinex hot wallets, worth the equivalent of around $72 million at the time.\nNow that the scandal is unfolding, Bitfinex customers have reportedly began withdrawing their funds from the platform as well to prevent money loss. For instance, United Kingdom-based entrepreneur Alistair Milne allegedly took away an unspecified sum worth at least $1 million from his Bitfinex wallet.\nAndrew Rossow told Cointelegraph that it is difficult to establish the potential outcome of this case at this point, given the absence of a broader regulatory framework:\n\u201cWhile laws like the Martin Act or TTA are just surfacing, what we are seeing primarily are cases of first impression with respect to how state and federal agencies, state and federal courts, and of course pre-existing and new federal laws are being applied to the realm of digital currency.\"\n\u201cAgain, we are seeing just how useful the Howey Test is and whether or not the law needs amending, or just to be overruled and re-written to cover both traditional investment contracts as well as 21st century digital currencies.\u201d\nThus, even though the underlying offenses/allegations might be familiar, these cases are of first impression, in Rossow\u2019s viewpoint. \u201cEvery state/court will be handling it differently, creating its own precedent, until finally the SEC [the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States] and a federal court upholds one or multiple rulings,\u201d he said, adding that the SEC is hiring a new legal cryptocurrency expert, which might result in more concrete regulations being introduced in the future.\nOzelli informed Cointelegraph that iFinex might face a number of harsh penalties as a result of the investigation \u2014 and even be driven off from the U.S. market altogether:\n\u201cBeyond NYAG's action, if Bitfinex failed to comply with federal tax laws including FATCA reporting rules, which it would need to comply with since it serves US customers, it could face severe IRS penalties in excess of the unreported foreign assets, and exclusion from access to U.S. markets. It could also face penalties for violating FINCEN, OFAC, CFTC, SEC or other state laws.\"\nTether\u2019s peg lives on, despite yet another scandal\nThe crypto market experienced a moderate slump following the allegations against Bitfinex, as most cryptocurrencies lost 4-7% of their value. Tether, on the other hand, has kept close to its peg, trading around $0.99 as of press time.\n\nMarket visualization from Coin360 from April 26\nAccording to Twitter user TrueUSD Printer, who monitors the circulation of various stablecoins, Tether added another $100,000,000 USDT to its total supply after the allegations were published. As the counsel for Tether reportedly explained to the OAG, new tether tokens are issued when \u201can investor has requested to purchase tethers by depositing U.S. dollars with Tether the company or by depositing U.S. dollars with a trading platform that is authorized to accept dollar deposits in exchange for tethers\u201d.\n\nUSDT 7-day price chart.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/samsung-joins-corporate-giants-reportedly-eyeing-bespoke-crypto", "title": " Samsung Joins Corporate Giants Reportedly Eyeing Bespoke Crypto ", "content": "Samsung is another big-name company to consider issuing its own cryptocurrency. Similar stories have already emanated from the likes of Facebook and JPMorgan Chase, with analysts speculating on various use cases for these cryptocurrency tokens.\nWhile not yet confirmed officially, a \u201cSamsung Coin\u201d could find application as a payment means on the company\u2019s app store and traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. The company has revealed that its flagship Galaxy S10 smartphone will have a built-in cryptocurrency wallet.\nWith these mega-corporations delving into the blockchain scene, it is perhaps important to see how their virtual currency implementation compares with each other and the rest of the virtual currency ecosystem.\nSamsung readies new ETH-based blockchain mainnet and cryptocurrency token\nOn Wednesday (April 24, 2019), an inside source within Samsung\u00a0revealed that the company\u2019s blockchain division was developing an Ethereum-based blockchain mainnet. According to the source, the project would also create a virtual asset dubbed \u201cSamsung Coin.\u201d\nCurrently, the Samsung hierarchy has offered no confirmation of the proposed blockchain mainnet and token. However, the reports appear to be consistent with the recent activities of the company in the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology space.\nAnswering questions at the Blockchain Expo in London on Thursday (April 25, 2019), the business development and fintech chief at Samsung SDS Europe, Moritz von Widekind, said the company hadn\u2019t decided on anything concrete yet.\nAccording to the Samsung executive, various departments within the company are working on the project. Von Widekind also added that the proposed token could be launched on the company\u2019s NextLedger enterprise blockchain platform.\nSamsung recently participated in a\u00a0$4 million investment round for ZenGo \u2014 a smartphone cryptocurrency wallet app. NextLedger continues to receive significant interest from companies around the world, most recently by Indian IT behemoth Mahindra.\nIn the absence of an official word from Samsung, it is impossible to know for certain the way in which the rumored token would work. However, given the electronic giant\u2019s business model, there are some plausible assumptions to be made.\nSamsung Coin could be used as a payment token within the company\u2019s payment app, Samsung Pay. The token may also be traded publicly on cryptocurrency exchanges across the market.\nLike the proposed Facebook Coin, no one can know for sure how the \u201ctokenomics\u201d of the cryptocurrency would work. If it turns out to be a payment coin, can it compete with the likes of bitcoin?\nFacebook making another play at a payment system\nBack in December 2018, Cointelegraph began reporting that Facebook, the largest social media platform in the world, was looking to launch its own in-app virtual currency. Like Samsung Coin, there isn\u2019t any official word on what form of crypto-related project could best describe the Facebook Coin (FB Coin).\nSome analysts and commentators say FB Coin will be a stablecoin pegged to a basket of fiat currencies and used for money transfers within the platform\u2019s apps. Such a move could potentially be a huge deal in the cross-border remittance market.\nAccording to the\u00a0World Payment Report (WPR) of 2018, global mobile money transactions topped $41 billion in 2016. This figure formed more than 8% of all noncash transactions, showing the growing appeal of e-wallet transactions.\nThe WPR study also showed that large tech firms like Google, Facebook and Tencent accounted for more than 70% of the global money transfer market as far back as 2016. An excerpt from the report reads:\n\u201cThese companies are leveraging their large-platform user base to make an impact in the payments space, focusing on providing seamless user experience, value-added features, and making use of network effects. Incumbents should learn from the BigTechs and invest in technology platforms in order to compete with them.\u201d\nThe proposed FB Coin isn\u2019t the company\u2019s first foray into the digital currency scene. Back in 2011-2012, the social media giant launched FacebookCredits and\u00a0Facebook Gifts.\nHowever, the company\u00a0discontinued the FacebookCredits service in 2012. The company did launch a peer-to-peer (p2p) payments service for the Messenger platform in 2015 but recently announced that it would also be\u00a0shutting it down.\nSome commentators even identified Facebook\u2019s decision to discontinue the Messenger payment service as a clear indication of the imminent launch of its cryptocurrency token. Earlier in April, Nathaniel Propper of The New York Times\u00a0declared that Facebook was on the hunt for $1 billion in\u00a0venture capital funding for the proposed token.\nAccording to Propper\u2019s\u00a0Twitter account:\n\u201cOne person I spoke with said that Facebook is talking about using the money as collateral for its cryptocurrency. Facebook has been designing the coin to keep a stable value, pegged to a basket of foreign currencies held in bank accounts.\u201d\nHas blockchain technology finally helped Facebook crack the code for establishing a functioning digital payment system? Does the social media giant now possess the requisite expertise to run a remittance platform or is FB Coin going to find some other user outside the payment arena? Only time will tell.\nConsumer use case for private blockchain cryptocurrencies\nIn mid-February 2019, Wall Street giant JPMorgan Chase\u00a0announced its own cryptocurrency, becoming the first United States bank to adopt virtual currency in business operations. According to the bank, JPM Coin will run on Quorom, an Ethereum-powered private blockchain.\nUnlike FB Coin, a lot is known about the plans JPMorgan Chase has for its cryptocurrency. JPM Coin, which is a stablecoin, will first be deployed in the bank\u2019s internal settlement protocols to increase the efficiency of the overall process.\nRight off the bat, some commentators expressed the position that JPM Coin could challenge bitcoin and XRP in the payment arena. However, by even JPMorgan Chase\u2019s own submission, the adoption of JPM Coin will be restricted to its large corporate clients.\nThere are, however, future plans to move the utilization of JPM Coin beyond the internal transactional paradigm in use at JPMorgan Chase.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-bandit-how-a-hacker-has-been-stealing-millions-worth-of-eth-by-guessing-weak-private-keys", "title": " \u2018Blockchain Bandit\u2019: How a Hacker Has Been Stealing Millions Worth of ETH by Guessing Weak Private Keys ", "content": "Earlier this week, United States-based security consulting firm Independent Security Evaluators (ISE) published a report on private keys for the Ethereum blockchain.\nDespite establishing around 700 weak private keys that are being regularly used by multiple people, the researchers found a \u201cblockchain bandit\u201d who has managed to collect almost 45,000 ether (ETH) by successfully guessing those frail private keys. Cointelegraph interviewed Adrian Bednarek, a senior security analyst at ISE, to find out more about what they describe as \u201cethercombing.\u201d\nResearch background and chief findings\nBednarek says he discovered the hacker by accident. At the time, he was doing research for a corporate client that planned to implement their own wallet with an integrated key generating algorithm.\n\u201cAs a security analyst, before you start any assessment, you have to understand the underlying technologies very clearly \u2014 basically as if you\u2019re creating them yourself,\u201d he told Cointelegraph.\n\u201cPrivate key generation was one of the components we had to research, and I was going through the basics of what is a private key on Ethereum: How large is it? How is it generated? And how is it used to derive the public key and public address?\u201d\nOn Ethereum, bitcoin (BTC) or any other major blockchain that supports the ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) protocol, private keys are represented by 256-bit numbers. The ISE narrowed it down to eight 32-bit \u201csub-regions\u201d in the 256-bit key space during their research, because brute forcing a private key within a larger region is meant to be a statistical improbability.\nThose eight sub-regions contained an overall amount of 34 billion weaker keys, which the ISE subsequently scanned. \u201cIt took an entire day,\u201d Bednarek says.\nIt is worth stressing that those keys were generated due to a faulty code and faulty random number generators, and the researchers were specifically targeting suboptimal keys.\n\u201cPrivate key is your user ID and your password at the same time,\u201d the security analyst explained while breaking down the basic mechanics. \u201cIt\u2019s different than your banking login, where you have your username and a password [...] Therefore, when two individual people use the same password for creating a Brainwallet [i.e., wallets that entail passphrases as part of generating private keys] \u2014 like \u2018password123\u2019 \u2014 they will both own the same exact wallet.\u201d As Bednarek puts it, \u201cit\u2019s like linking two people to the same bank account.\u201d\nInitially, the ISE specialist found that the private key of \u201c1\u201d *, which was picked because it is the lower bound of a possible private key, was actually being used on the blockchain. Furthermore, it had been involved in several thousand transactions.\n* \u2013 (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001, if written using the 256-bit code)\n\u201cThat was a red flag,\u201d Bednarek recalled. \u201cWhy are people using the private key of 1? That shouldn\u2019t be possible.\u201d His team started to scan more keys to see how widespread the problem was. Although the ISE researchers had established that this issue is not particularly omnipresent, they had found as many as 732 weak private keys associated with a total of 49,060 transactions.\n\u201cRoughly, there\u2019s about 50 million keys that have been used on [the] Ethereum [blockchain], \u00a0and we\u2019ve only discovered 732 of those.\u201d\nThe blockchain bandit\nAs mentioned above, during their research, the ISE team noticed how some of the wallets associated with the private keys \u2014 found with their suboptimal methods \u2014 had a lot of transactions going to a specific address, and no money was coming back out. As Bednarek said in an explanatory video posted on the ISE website:\n\u201cThere was a guy who had an address who was going around and siphoning money from some of the keys we had access to. We found 735 private keys, he happened to take money from 12 of those keys we also had access to. It\u2019s statistically improbable he would guess those keys by chance, so he was probably doing the same thing. [\u2026] He was basically stealing funds as soon as they came into people\u2019s wallets.\u201d\nIn a conversation with Cointelegraph, Bednarek explained that the hacker (or a group of hackers) had set up a node to automatically swipe funds from addresses with weak keys. To verify that, the researchers used a honeypot: They sent a dollar using a weak private key, which they knew the hacker was aware of, to see how fast it would be taken. The money was gone in a matter of seconds, the ISE employee said:\n\u201cIf it was a manual thing, maybe it would have been taken within a day or whatever. But as soon as we sent it we went on the blockchain explorer, we saw that there was a transfer going out immediately, within seconds. So basically what he [the hacker] has is a blockchain node that is part of the transaction network set up somewhere. As soon as it sees transactions come in with a private key of which he has knowledge of, it immediately sends a request to transfer the money out.\u201d\nAs per the data obtained from Etherscan, the hacker\u2019s wallet contains around 45,000 ETH (worth more than $7.3 million, as of the time of writing). At the height of ether\u2019s value, it is estimated that the bandit\u2019s loot could have been sold for more than $50 million.\nAccording to the comment section for the fraudster\u2019s wallet address, it had been stealing funds for several years. One of the comments, purportedly submitted by major ETH wallet provider MyEtherWallet (MEW) features a link to a 2016 Reddit thread titled \u201cEthereum nodes with insecure RPC settings are actively exploited.\u201d In it, a redditor described setting up an Ethereum node \u201cwith its HTTP RPC API exposed to the internet\u201d and getting attacked within a few minutes after going live.\n\u201cIf you google the [hacker\u2019s] address there\u2019s a lot of people complaining about him,\u201d Bednarek confirms, admitting that the fraudster\u2019s tacts have proven to be quite successful:\n\u201cThis guy has taken a multi-prong approach to stealing money.\u201d\nThe security analyst then described the fraudster's method in greater detail: \u201cOne \u2014 he is looking at bad private keys. Two \u2014 he is looking at weak passphrase-based wallets and misconfigured RPCs. You are not really supposed to expose the RPC of your Ethereum node but sometimes people do, and if you don\u2019t have the password set somebody can basically empty out the default wallet associated with your node.\u201d\nBut such asset-grabbing is not a problem that is exclusive to the Ethereum blockchain, the ISE security researcher warns. \u201cIt [the blockchain] is working as intended, it\u2019s just the way people are using it,\u201d he said, describing an ethics-related problem his team faced while doing their research:\n\u201cBefore we started on this [the research], we had an ethical dilemma \u2014 what if we find the wallet with a key that has a million dollar in it? Do we just leave it there? But if we leave it there, we know it\u2019s behind a bad private key and it is likely to get stolen, therefore we would be somewhat responsible this money getting stolen because we could have notified somebody. But then the second problem is who do we notify? There is no easy way to identify the owner of a private key. Maybe we could take the money temporarily until somebody could prove that it was theirs? But then it creates a lot of legal issues. So the CEO of the company [that they were doing the research for] contacted the IFS for legal advice and they basically said: \u2018if you find anything, leave it there. Don\u2019t do any transfers. That way you won\u2019t get yourself into any legal hot water.\u2019\u201d\nSecurity advice and further research\nTherefore, according to Bednarek, private keys tend to be vulnerable due to two main factors. The first is coding errors in the software responsible for generating them. Secondly, some crypto owners have a tendency to obtain identical private keys through weak passphrases such as \u201cabc123,\u201d or even leaving them blank.\nFor instance, the ISE report established that one of the most popular weak private keys is the one generated from an empty recovery phrase \u2014 i.e., \u201c \u00a0\u00a0\u201d \u2014 using the Parity wallet. There have reportedly been 8,772 transactions on this address with a total of 5,215,586 ETH transferred.\n\u201cFor a while Parity let you use a default password of nothing and it would generate the private key based on that,\u201d Bednarek explains, adding that the wallet developer allegedly fixed the issue at some point. \u201cI think they have introduced a minimum password requirements [since then]. It might be just a single character, but you can\u2019t use blank passwords on Parity right now if you\u2019re using the latest version of their software.\u201d\nNo wallet creators have contacted the ISE yet, according to Bednarek:\n\u201cThat is an interesting issue because it\u2019s hard to say which wallet was responsible, if there was a wallet at all \u2014 it could be just people entering the wrong private keys, it could be early debug versions of wallets, it could be developers themselves. It\u2019s a bit hard to say why this exists and which wallet is at fault. It\u2019s something I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever know.\u201d\nBednarek\u2019s main advice for those who are not computer-savvy is to use well-known and trusted wallets, possibly moving to hardware or paper-based wallets if large amounts of cryptocurrency are involved. He said:\n\u201cIf there\u2019s going to be trading or holding of a lot of currency then use a hardware wallet where the private key will never be revealed. A lot of my friends that are long term holders use paper wallets where they generate a random key and store it on paper so it never touches the computer at all.\u201d", "birthday": "2019-04-28T11:43:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-28 10:43:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 28}

He is an economic and financial columnist featured on leading Italian and international publications.\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.\nSixteen months after from a peak value of $19,100, bitcoin is now hovering around $5,000. Despite its wide distance from the historical maximum, today\u2019s price is good news for the market, as the recent rise could be the end of the collapse produced by the violent explosion of the digital currency bubble in 2018. From December 2017, the price of every digital asset has fallen, on average, 80%; for bitcoin, it has been the second collapse ever recorded, a violent fall even for an unconventional asset that has historically shown very marked boom-and-bust cycles. In 2011, the price declined by 93% \u2014 to $2 from a maximum of $39 \u2014 while in 2013, in just a few weeks, the price exploded to $1,151 to decline later to $177 over a 12-month period.\nIt is not certain that, this time, the bottom has been touched, despite the encouraging developments of the last weeks: Historically, the phase of rapid decline is followed by a stagnation of the price that can even last years, named in jargon as a \"crypto winter.\"\nIn the context of a widespread speculative bubble that the so-called \u201caltcoins\u201d have turned out to be, apart from any technical evaluation, simple variants more volatile and less liquid than bitcoin, almost perfectly correlated with each other. This feature made any attempt to diversify the risk between different crypto-assets futile.\n\n\nAmong altcoins, a specific mention should go to Ethereum; this is the digital currency classified as second in terms of capitalization that has been exploited as a technical platform for the proliferation of the initial coin offerings (ICOs). These ICOs have been exploited to cover real public purchase offers by collecting financial resources sheltered from regulators and by financing dubiously weak or shady projects. Most of these initiatives have invariably destroyed economic resources or turned out to be real scams in which investors' defensive capabilities were substantially nullified.\nEx-post, the price pattern during the bitcoin bubble closely followed the asymmetric behavior of its historical cousins, starting with the Tulipan bubble of 1637, passing through that of the South Sea Company up to the most recent burst of the dot-com bubble of 1999-2000.\nAfter a phase of moderate rise, a very rapid manic phase of vertical price growth of about nine months followed, with a final buying hysteria in December 2017 \u2014 the month in which the price more than doubled, starting from an already very high base. The summit was touched with a classic \"double peak\" in January 2018, synchronized \u2014 not surprisingly \u2014 with the achievement of the maxima on global stock markets and with the peak of liquidity released into the global economy by the main central banks. Since then, the price of bitcoin has had an almost uninterrupted decline, with very rapid collapses, and shorter and less convincing recoveries, with descending relative maxima.\nWhat is the floor of this incredible descent?\nOn the subject, we must consider that bitcoin, its clones and the rest of the digital currencies do not have their own intrinsic value. Prices are simply determined by the intersection of demand and supply on individual exchange markets; these are often highly illiquid prices, differing from each other by hundreds of euros without effective arbitrage between the various markets due to the structural limits of bitcoin and settlement platforms. Therefore, it is very difficult to think of determining what the fair value could be.\nOften for traders operating on these markets, the technical analysis is the only tool for interpreting price movements. This paradoxically means that the price dynamic, determined by the collective actions of the traders, sometimes follows the forecasting patterns of the technical analysis.\nUnder this overall picture, it is worth trying to isolate the main drivers of the rise and fall of bitcoin and other altcoins. The role played by the stablecoin tether has been predominant in the phase of the rapid price increase between March and December 2017.\nA stablecoin is a digital currency anchored with a fixed exchange rate to a fiat currency traded on the forex market, such as the dollar or the euro. Its existence is justified by the fact that, at present, the conversion between fiat and digital currencies is still slow and cumbersome, given that it requires a funds transfer from traditional banks to crypto exchanges via cross-border banks\u2019 payment systems, whose settlement may require several days.\nThe conversion between digital currencies is instead instantaneous and allows traders to protect themselves by using stablecoins from the very high volatility of bitcoin\u2019s and altcoins\u2019 prices. Of course, 1 tether is not equivalent to $1 because it cannot be freely converted, although the company itself has always declared to hold a reserve of dollars corresponding to the quantity of tether issued and circulating on the exchanges. However, for traders, tether performs the same function of the dollar, so it is irrelevant whether there is or is not full or partial convertibility.\nIn April 2019, there are at least eight different stablecoins on the market offering the same tether service, but in 2017, tether substantially managed a monopoly that heavily influenced the price trend on the various exchanges, as evidenced by a statistical analysis made by the University of Austin, Texas. What\u2019s happened has a lot to do with the fact that the company that issued tether was de facto controlled by the largest crypto exchange in Asia, Bitfinex.\n\n\nBy examining the data (see figures above) we can observe how the price behavior of bitcoin (and of the other altcoins) in the \u201cpump\u201d phase of the bubble is perfectly correlated with the issuing of new tether on the exchanges. As the aforementioned research shows, it is statistically probable that the Bitfinex exchange has artificially fueled the manic buying of digital currencies through the issuing of increasing amounts of tether. In a phase of exponential price rise, the issuing of tether without adequate coverage in dollars is a profitable strategy. In fact, speculators could buy digital currencies with newly minted tether, counting on being able to resell them at a higher price later and replenish the dollar reserves. The signal of strong price increases in increasingly accelerated times contributed to the growth of the media hype on digital currencies, which attracted retail investors with little experience in digital assets, often unaware of the enormous risks related to the terminal phase of a speculative bubble.\nThe long price contraction, perhaps not yet completed despite the recent recovery in prices, was caused by two main factors operating in two distinct time phases. Between January and April 2018, the decline was demand-driven and therefore determined by the flight of frightened speculative investors, highly exposed to losses due to the purchases made at very high prices. In this classic panic-selling, it can be noted that the support of a growing issue of tether was also lacking on the exchanges. In fact, since February, the growth of tether in circulation has slowed down and flattened out; this is indicative of the fact that, in a declining market, the strategy of issuing uncovered tether was no longer profitable.\nIn June 2018, the price apparently found a floor at around $6,000, a level still over 10 times greater than the price that bitcoin had at the beginning of 2017. At this point, the majority of speculative investors has already disappeared, and the volatility of digital currencies was drastically reduced as trades gradually became thinner (see figure below). Many analysts believed that, at this stage, $6,000 was the minimum level necessary to offset the energy costs of the miners that were digitally \"coining\" the new crypto assets. Until then, the need of a widening population of miners to catch cover rising production costs was a force that supported the price growth of digital assets.\n", "birthday": "2019-04-27T22:33:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-27 21:33:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 27}

With the JPM Coin launched earlier this year, it seems that the U.S. financial institution is increasingly betting on blockchain, pushing crypto closer to mainstream adoption.\nBrief intro to JPM and crypto: the \u201cBlockchain before Bitcoin\u201d approach\nJPM has been maintaining an overall mixed stance on virtual currencies. Its CEO, Jamie Dimon, is perhaps best known among crypto enthusiasts for his harsh comments regarding bitcoin.\nIn 2017, Dimon openly called bitcoin a \u201cfraud.\u201d A year later, the banking giant\u2019s CEO reterierted his position by saying that he doesn\u2019t \u201creally give a s---\u201d about the cryptocurrency. Lately, however, he has taken a somewhat softer approach toward bitcoin: At the 2019 World Economic Forum in Davos, when the JPMorgan Chase head was asked if he took any satisfaction when the cryptocurrency collapsed last year, he replied that he did not.\nHowever, despite his unmasked criticism aimed at the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, Dimon has been much more careful when discussing the technology that underpins it. Back in 2015, he first shared his thoughts on the subject, stating that \u201cblockchain is like any other technology,\u201d but then also clarifying:\n\u201cIf it is cheaper, effective, works, and secure, then we are going to use it. The technology will be used, and it could be used to transport currency, but it will be dollars, not bitcoins.\u201d\nAt the latest Davos gathering, Dimon voiced his updated, more optimistic opinion on blockchain. Specifically, the JPM CEO noted that he is pro-blockchain, despite the excessive hype around the technology, and that the technology serves as a better replacement for certain online databases:\n\u201cBlockchain is a real technology \u2014 it\u2019s just a database we can all access that\u2019s kept up-to-date.\u201d\nIndeed, JPM\u2019s experiments with blockchain date back to 2016, when the banking behemoth published a white paper for Quorum, its private blockchain platform built on the Ethereum protocol.\nQuorum was created as part of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA), of which JPM is one of the founding partners. As mentioned above, the platform runs on the Ethereum blockchain and is modeled after the Ethereum Go client. It has been adopted by pharmaceutical giants Pfizer and Genentech as well as Microsoft Azure, among others. It has also been tested with a number of high-profile players, including National Bank of Canada and Goldman Sachs Asset Management. In March 2019, JPMorgan Chase announced that it was considering making Quorum an independent entity in a bid to attract more partners that could be reluctant to deal with JPM directly if they are competitors of the bank.\nIIN: the ever-growing, blockchain-powered international network of banks\nThe IIN, in turn, is JPM\u2019s peer-to-peer network powered by Quorum. Launched as a pilot back in 2017, it aims to deal with issues of interbank information sharing, \u201cfrom minimizing friction in the cross-border payments process to enabling payments to reach beneficiaries faster and with fewer steps,\u201d as per the company\u2019s website. Suresh Shetty, blockchain technology lead for IIN, explained:\n\"Historically, correspondent banks communicate one-way, bank-to-bank, but we have transformed their interaction. When a payment detail is flagged for confirmation, different parties can interact simultaneously, requesting and sharing information.\"\nAs of March 2019, more than 220 banks worldwide have signed up as members of the IIN, including banking powerhouses such as Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), Cr\u00e9dit Agricole \u2014 the world\u2019s largest cooperative bank by turnover \u2014 and Banco Santander. The network is expanding at a swift pace: More than 60 banks joined it just within the past few months, given that the IIN consisted of 157 member banks as of January this year.\nHowever, just like with Quorum, some financial institutions might be hesitant to join a JPM-supervised venture, according to Hartej Sawhney, a blockchain expert and co-founder of Hosho, a company protecting investments and providing multiple smart contract services. He told Cointelegraph:\n\u201cIIN is not a competitor to Ripple unless it begins to sweep all the banks in the world onto their network, which could be difficult for JPM given their historical reputation. Ripple, Circle, and Transferwises advantage may be that they are third-party intermediaries, not banks themselves.\u201d\nHowever, the main priority for the INN is not to facilitate cross-border payments with stablecoins or its own cryptocurrency (which is what Ripple is actively trying to achieve with its similarly sized RippleNet), but rather to tackle the current system\u2019s downsides with a blockchain-powered solution.\n\u201cBroadly speaking, the cross-border payments system works quite well. Attempts to construct some new way of transacting on blockchain look to us like a solution in search of a problem,\u201d\nSungmahn Seo, head of Europe, Middle East and Africa payments and foeign exchange at JPMorgan Chase, told Euromoney in October 2018, outlining the INN\u2019s primary goal:\n\u201cHowever, when a cross-border payment does get stuck for whatever reason, that can get quite painful. It can be difficult and can take weeks to resolve. We want to make resolving stuck payments much simpler and much easier, and that is about easing access for the right parties to the right information.\u201d\nAccording to Seo, the U.S. banking giant receives 100,000 to 200,000 enquiries regarding stuck payments every year, and most of them are international. He described the hurdle it entails for banks in greater detail:\n\"There can be many steps between multiple correspondent banks in sending a payment from the US to China, for example. And when a query pops up, the question becomes: which bank has the full and complete information? Banks start sending emails but some banks don\u2019t like to respond that way because email may be insecure. So, then it\u2019s phone calls between banks in very different time zones. The query can start ping-ponging around. When it gets painful, it gets really painful. A payment that should have taken minutes can take many days to complete as requests for information ping-pong between the banks.\u201d\nThus, instead of handling cross-border payments like Ripple-created XRP and other SWIFT-killers that aim to overtake the conventional money transferring structure and put it on blockchain rails, the IIN is merely an encrypted distributed ledger network that allows participants to identify themselves and share information necessary for sending money \u2014 and not necessarily large amounts \u2014 to each other. Notably, neither Ripple nor the IIN and has revealed publicly exactly how their systems work, Eyal Shani, blockchain researcher at Aykesubir, pointed out in a conversation with Cointelegraph.\nNow, some new crucial features are being added to the ever-growing network. As John Hunter, JPM\u2019s head of global clearing, told the Financial Times, the IIN members will be able to instantly verify whether a payment is heading to a valid bank account \u2014 as per the new update, scheduled to go live by the third quarter of 2019. At present, transactions can be rejected days after they were sent because of incorrect information, such as typos in sort codes, account numbers and addresses. Hunter told the Financial Times:", "birthday": "2019-04-25T13:15:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-25 12:15:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 25}

But other blockchain-for-land efforts \u2014 such as those in Vermont, Brazil and Ukraine \u2014 have succumbed to \u201cpilot-itis.\u201d These projects worked on a small scale, and were even replicated, but haven\u2019t been able to reach larger populations.\nThere are a few noticeable trends behind why some projects scaled and others didn\u2019t. Pilots that struggled to expand ignored influential stakeholders in the early stages. Or, projects tried to address problems for which blockchain was an ill-suited solution. There were frequently unrealistic expectations concerning outcomes, partially due to a lack of blockchain education. Projects are too often undertaken by governments enthusiastic about the technology, but fuzzy on how it works and what it can deliver. Sometimes, a project was implemented under the wrong bureaucratic or legal conditions.\nA land registry should first think more critically about its capabilities, needs and ecosystem before implementing a blockchain-based solution. A set of recommendations to assist land officials during their exploration and implementation of blockchain is below:\nGet tech experts and land experts in the same room\nBlockchain is a database technology at its most basic, while land administration is a public issue with wide-ranging political, social and economic impacts. So, the stakeholders in the room need to understand both technology and land. Those are usually two different sets of people.\nA blockchain-for-land project should engage with political, technical and socioeconomic stakeholders from the very beginning. For example, senior land officials can provide long-term strategic vision, and also possess the experience to spot unintended consequences and risks related to blockchain. IT professionals understand technological nuances and can better evaluate blockchain as a back-end technology. Finally, outreach to the broader real estate community can help to promote blockchain as a tool to improve business operations.\nIdentify the problem and determine whether blockchain can actually solve that problem\nStakeholders must work together to answer the following question: What is limiting the everyday functionality of the land registry?\nThere are many possible responses, ranging from undocumented land rights to record manipulation, poor service delivery and sloppy paper-based storage. But blockchain can\u2019t solve every problem, and identifying the specific issue to be solved will help determine whether blockchain is an appropriate answer.\nBlockchain will not address problems related to inaccurate, outdated or nonexistent records. Nor is the technology particularly helpful in cases in which records aren\u2019t digitized. It can\u2019t rewrite land laws or improve the institutional capacity of a registry, either.\nBlockchain is useful for solving issues concerning corruption, lack of trust, inefficient services and secure data. Still, the technology isn\u2019t a cure-all, and stakeholders must be realistic about the potential of blockchain:", "birthday": "2019-04-24T13:39:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-24 12:39:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 24}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nUnlike the previous bull market, recovery this time is likely to be a long one because every higher level will bring in huge supply, causing the market to correct. We also expect the markets to take a dip intermittently to shake out the weaker hands.\nMany still doubt the future of this nascent asset class. In a recent survey of a few European nations, 63% of participants were confident that cryptocurrencies will exist in 10 years in some form or the other. However, the respondents were not that upbeat on Bitcoin, as only 49% believed that it will exist in 10 year from now. Even fewer, only 7%, hope to see Bitcoin as an investment and security tool in 10 years. This shows that some are still oblivious to the huge potential of this space.\nHowever, companies across the world have been experimenting with blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Societe Generale SFH is working towards improving the transparency and transferability of bond issuances. In this regard, it has issued 100 million euro bond as a security token on the Ethereum blockchain.\nSamsung might launch its own cryptocurrency named Samsung Coin, according to anonymous sources. Walt Disney Corp. is in talks to buy out online gaming giant NXC Corporation, which in turn has stakes in Korbit and Bitstamp crypto exchanges.\nBitfury has obtained approval for a dedicated bitcoin mining fund for institutional investors from Liechtenstein. This will give an opportunity to the institutions to invest in the interesting world of bitcoin mining.\nCurrently, altcoins are tumbling. Do any of them offer a buying opportunity? Let\u2019s find out.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) is currently facing some resistance close to $5,600. However, both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is still close to overbought levels. This shows that the bulls are in charge. On the upside, a breakout of $5,600 can propel the price to the next critical zone of $5,674.84\u2013$5,900. We anticipate the bears to defend this zone. Hence, traders can book partial profits on their remaining long positions above $5,600 and keep the stop loss on the rest at $4,800.\n\nConversely, if the bears sink the BTC/USD pair below the 20-day EMA, it can slide to the next support at $4,914.11. This is a critical support, which might hold. A breakdown of this level will hurt sentiment as it will weaken momentum and indicate that the bears are still shorting at higher levels. If the bulls fail to defend $4,914.11, the digital currency can dip to the 50-day SMA. The next few days are critical as it will determine whether the recovery is over or if this is only a shakeout.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) again reversed direction from the overhead resistance at $180 on April 23. The price has broken down of the 20-day EMA and has re-entered the triangle, which is a bearish sign. This shows that the breakout from the triangle did not find any buyers at higher levels.\n\nIf the bulls fail to push the price back above $167.32 within the next couple of days, the ETH/USD pair can drop to the 50-day SMA. A break of this support can sink the pair to $144.78. Hence, traders can retain the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $150. We would have suggested closing the entire position but the moving averages are still sloping up and the RSI is at the midpoint, which shows that the bulls are still in the game.\nIf the bulls quickly push the price back above $167.32, it will again try to break out of the overhead resistance zone of $180\u2013$187.98. It will pick up momentum above $187.98.\nXRP/USD\nAfter holding the 50-day SMA for four days, Ripple (XRP) plunged below it today. This is a negative sign. It can now drop to $0.27795, which is a critical support. If this support also gives way, a retest of the yearly low at $0.24508 will be in the cards.\n\nHowever, if the support at $0.27795 holds, the XRP/USD pair might remain range bound for a few more days. The 20-day EMA is gradually sloping down and the RSI has dived into the negative territory, which suggests the bears are back in command. The pair has been one of the weakest digital currencies as it has not participated in the recent recovery. This shows a lack of demand for it. We therefore withdraw the existing buy recommendation. We will wait for the price to signal a trend reversal before suggesting a long position in it.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has broken down of the 20-day EMA and is on its way to the next support at $255. The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is at the center, which points to a consolidation in the near term.\n\nIf the bulls fail to defend $255, it will be a negative sign. The next stop is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally at $241.97. If this level also fails to hold, the drop can stretch to the 50-day SMA. The trend is gradually turning in favor of the bears, but if the BCH/USD pair finds buyers at $255, it will remain range bound between $255 and $335.63 for a few days.\nEOS/USD\nThe attempts by the bulls to push EOS back above the 20-day EMA did not sustain. It has plunged below the support and is on its way to the next support of $4.4930. The uptrend line of the rising wedge is at this level and the 50-day SMA is placed just above it. Therefore, we expect a strong defense by the bulls.\n\nBut if the price breaks down of the uptrend line, it will complete the bearish rising wedge pattern that has a target objective of $2.80. However, there are a slew of supports between $3.8723 and $3.00. We expect one of these to hold. With the 20-day EMA weakening and the RSI in the negative territory, the bears are attempting to regain the upper hand.\nNonetheless, if the EOS/USD pair bounces off the 50-day SMA, the bulls will try to push the price back above the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line. If successful, a rally to $6.0726 and above it to $6.8299 is possible. We suggest traders wait for the price to stabilize and signal a turnaround before attempting to go long.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) failed to rise above the 20-day EMA after breaking down of it on April 21. This attracted further selling and the bears broke down the immediate support of $74.6054. The price is presently at the 50-day SMA, which is a strong support. If this support also breaks, the drop can extend to $62.450.\n\nConversely, if the LTC/USD pair rebounds from the 50-day SMA, it will attempt to rise to the overhead resistance of $91. The 20-day EMA has started to slope down and the RSI has declined into the negative zone. This suggests that the bears are making a comeback. Considering the weakness, we have withdrawn the buy proposed in our earlier analysis. We will wait for the uptrend to resume before suggesting a trade in it.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) has pulled back to the 20-day EMA after failing to make a new high on April 20. Both the moving averages are sloping up, which shows that the trend is bullish. The RSI has also corrected the overbought levels. If the price rebounds from the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to retest the lifetime highs.\n\nHowever, if the BNB/USD pair slips below the 20-day EMA, it can drop to the uptrend line of the rising wedge. The 50-day SMA is just below this level, hence, we anticipate a strong support at this level, but if the price fails to hold this support, it will complete a bearish rising wedge pattern that has a minimum target objective of $13.60. We shall wait for a reliable buy setup to form before recommending a trade in it.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) has broken down of the 50-day EMA and the immediate support of $0.1090. It is currently trying to find some support at the uptrend line. The 20-day EMA is starting to turn down and the RSI has dived below 50. This shows that the bears have the upper hand.\n\nIf the bulls defend the uptrend line, the XLM/USD pair might attempt to bounce back above the moving averages. If the price ascends the moving averages, it will then face resistance at the downtrend line.\nOn the other hand, if the bears sink the pair below the uptrend line, it will become negative and can slide to $0.08.\nADA/USD\nThough Cardano (ADA) broke out of the channel on April 23, it hit a roadblock at $0.082952. Currently, the price has dipped to the 50-day SMA, which is a strong support. But if this level gives way, a fall to the support of the channel is probable.", "birthday": "2019-04-24T19:13:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-24 18:13:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 24}

Well, it turns out the platform is still under maintenance, or so the company says.\nMeanwhile, Cointelegraph has received exclusive details from stakeholders reportedly affected by the situation. These reports, for the most part, were only discussed on social media platforms like Twitter and Telegram but have yet to make an appearance on the cryptocurrency news circuit \u2014 until now.\nThe CoinBene saga \u2014 timeline of events\nOn Monday (March 25, 2019), there were massive outgoing transactions from\u00a0CoinBene\u2019s hot wallet to an\u00a0unknown wallet that did not exist prior to that Monday. These transactions reportedly involved every single ERC-20 token (totaling 109) held by the company.\nThose tokens include huobipool token (HPT), pundi X (NPSX), maximine coin (MXM) and udoo (UDOO). The latter two will prove important later on in this narrative.\nThe following day (March 26, 2019),\u00a0Cointelegraph reported an announcement from CoinBene stating that the platform was undergoing maintenance. However, several reports were circulating at the time that the cryptocurrency exchange had been hacked.\nUsers on the platform had begun to report issues concerning pending deposits, which is often a sign that an exchange has fallen victim to cybercriminals.\nSome stakeholders, like Nick Saponaro of Diviproject, alerted the cryptocurrency public to massive outgoing transactions from CoinBene\u2019s wallet. For its part, CoinBene\u00a0denied these allegations, saying that customer funds were safe and that it would announce the completion of the maintenance at a later date.\nAs pointed out by James Edwards, cryptocurrency analysts and editor of the blog Zerononcense, the cleanout of CoinBene\u2019s hot wallet did not include ether (ETH), coinbene coin and maximine coin. The suspected hacker only removed a portion of CoinBene\u2019s MXM holdings.\nThese tokens were sent to about 12 addresses separate from the alleged hacker\u2019s address. These 12 addresses are also fairly new \u2014 created around the same period as the suspected hack. The inbound transactions from CoinBene are the first recorded in all 12 addresses.\nRumors of the hack only added to the negative press surrounding CoinBene, following a previous revelation that the platform was inflating its trading volume. A report by Bitwise Asset Management earlier in March had\u00a0identified CoinBene as one of the platforms engaged in\u00a0wash trading.\nCurious details\nOn March 27, 2019, the day after CoinBene\u2019s maintenance announcement, data scientists at Elementus \u2014 a blockchain infrastructure firm \u2014 published a report that described the fund transfers out of CoinBene\u2019s hot wallet bore all the hallmarks of a hack.\nThe Elementus report provided the first definitive glimpse of the monetary value of these fund transfer, which stood at $105 at the time. According to the report, the fact that the ERC-20 tokens removed from CoinBene\u2019s wallet were subsequently sold could point to the fact that the platform had been hacked.\nAn excerpt from the report,\u00a0stated:\n\u201cAfter leaving CoinBene, the tokens were quickly moved into Etherdelta, where they were sold for ETH. A large amount of funds were also moved into centralized Exchanges, including Binance, Huobi, and Bittrex. The funds continue to move into exchanges as I write this.\u201d\nIf indeed the hack theory is correct, it would explain the movement of the other three tokens not involved in the attack. CoinBene was most likely trying to secure those tokens in its cold wallet.\nHowever, there is a problem with this explanation, and the issue lies in the timeline of events. According to Edwards, the transfer of the three tokens not involved in the hack occurred several hours after the suspected hack took place.\nThus, valuable ETH and about 1.2 billion MXM (worth about $118.6 million) were left untouched by the hacker. Days later, MaxiMine would issue a new smart contract and send 1.9 billion MXM ($200 million) to CoinBene.\nSo, CoinBene reportedly suffered a hack, had $118.6 million worth of a particular token spared in the suspected attack but finally ended up with $200 million worth of that same token after the fact \u2014 all within the space of three days.\nMeanwhile, all the other tokens previously held in the company\u2019s wallet are still reading the same amounts they did after the hack. In addition, maximine\u2019s price surged between those three days.\nHowdoo.io: How 18 million UDOO disappeared in the CoinBene hack\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph, David Brierley, the CEO of Howdoo, one of the projects affected in the alleged theft, provided two weeks\u2019 correspondence between his company and a representative of CoinBene listed as a manager on the platform\u2019s LinkedIn page.\nAccording to the correspondence, the March 25 incident saw\u00a018.4 million UDOO ($209,000) removed from the CoinBene hot wallet. According to Brierley, upon initial contact with CoinBene, the manager admitted to not knowing the source of the intrusion \u2014 while still telling the public that there was ongoing maintenance.\nMeanwhile, Brierley says CoinBene still allowed people to trade nonexistent udoo tokens on the platform. Consequently, the price of udoo began to tank. CoinBene was trying to devalue udoo\u2019s price so it could easily cover its losses from the suspected hack.\nSuddenly, on March 28, 2019, CoinBene put out an announcement saying the Howdoo project was undergoing maintenance. Brierley shared the statement with Cointelegraph, which reads as follows:\n\u201cThe UDOO project are doing maintenance upgrades recently. CoinBene has suspended UDOO\u2019s trading function already. After the completion of the upgrade and maintenance, the transaction function will be opened and the specific time will be announced separately.\u201d\nAccording to the Howdoo CEO, the above statement was not only false, but an attempt to pin the problem on the Howdoo project team. CoinBene also ceased trading on udoo, which alerted even more token holders to the situation.\nFrom this point onward, the conversation features several attempts by the manager to deflect, claiming that upper management at CoinBene was looking into the matter. Meanwhile, the Howdoo CEO continued to press for a concrete answer from the platform.\nBy March 29, 2019, Brierley began pressing CoinBene to come clean about the hack to the broader cryptocurrency community. In reply, the CoinBene manager stated that such a decision was above his pay grade.\nUnder the radar: Attempted coverup?\nApril 1, 2019 heralded yet another twist in the tale, as the entity responsible for the original removal of the 18.4 million udoo tokens sent them back to the project\u2019s smart contract. This action effectively destroyed the tokens and offered further evidence that CoinBene had been hacked.\nFor Brierley, the hacker probably wanted to make a statement, as it seemed highly unlikely that a hacker would give up their loot in such a manner. Sperando\u2019s response was for the Howdoo team to come up with a solution that sorted out the matter quietly, without CoinBene having to make any of the details public.\nThe details of the conversation show Brierley objecting to this course of action:\n\u201cThe loss here is for the users of CoinBene who had uDOO in their custody at CoinBene. The relationship is between CoinBene and its users.\u201d\nAt this point in the correspondence thread, the CoinBene business development manager suggests that it would be better for the Howdoo team to communicate with someone higher up in the organization.\nThe manager then said a certain individual would contact Brierley on the next steps to take. The company\u2019s LinkedIn page lists this individual as an \u201cAssistant\u201d in one of the departments. According to the manager, the individual has ties with upper management.\nThe conversation with the individual yielded little result, as the CoinBene employee simply asked Brierley to facilitate an 18.4 million UDOO transfer from Howdoo\u2019s treasury to cover the lost tokens.\nBrierley told Cointelegraph that CoinBene later sent another offer for Howdoo to provide the 18.4 million udoo for a knocked-down price of $50,000, to which Howdoo declined. Meanwhile, CoinBene continued to tout the official maintenance line, obscuring the behind-the-scenes goings-on from the public.\nThe Howdoo chief shared a screenshot of CoinBene\u2019s official Telegram channel in which a user asked the channel admin when the trading of udoo would resume. The admin simply replied:\n\u201cPlease wait for the completion of maintenance.\u201d\nCointelegraph reached out to CoinBene for comments via various channels of communication. The only responses received were via the company\u2019s Twitter handle, which promised to provide answers to Cointelegraph\u2019s inquiries, as well as from the manager, whose reply on Monday (April 15, 2018) reads in part:\n\u201cThank you for getting in contact with me! I forwarded your request to our global marketing department, in charge of all our PR, with a strong suggestion for at least a statement, I'll follow up this overnight tonight.\u201d\nCointelegraph has yet to receive any further response from both channels.\nWhen asked what the next course of action would be for Howdoo, Brierley responded:\n\u201cWe have already begun pursuing legal avenues and have reached out to lawyers in Singapore and China to see if affected users in the community can set up a class action suit against CoinBene and its founders.\u201d\nCoinBene and MXM: More questions than answers\nJudging solely based on the experiences described by the Howdoo team, it would seem that CoinBene cover up the fact that it suffered a hack. Well, remember MaxiMine, the platform whose the token the suspected hacker left largely untouched? Well, investigating certain oddities surrounding the MaxiMine\u2019s alleged involvement in the matter pushes the CoinBene story into a suspiciously sinister territory.\nA lot of the following observations and deductions first appeared on Edward\u2019s blog post published earlier in April. According to the blog post, examining the chain of events throws up some irregularities in the dealings between CoinBene and MaxiMine.", "birthday": "2019-04-23T20:59:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-23 19:59:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 23}

The weekend kicked off with the\u00a0announcement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) joining forces with the\u00a0World Bank to launch a private blockchain coupled with a \u201cquasi-cryptocurrency\u201d for training purposes, then continued with the\u00a0Spring Meetings of the two organizations\u2019 Boards of Governors in Washington, D.C., which ran throughout the whole week.\nAlthough it would be an overstatement to claim that distributed ledgers were particularly conspicuous on the forum\u2019s overall agenda, the program included a series of fintech workshops, as well as at least a couple of major talks relevant to grasping where global regulators stand on some issues pertinent to crypto and blockchain applications. Situated in the context of the IMF\u2019s previous statements and actions, the ideas expressed at the meetings can update our understanding of the intellectual currents that shape how international financial institutions envision the future of blockchain technology.\nSpring Meetings\nChristine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, moderated the\u00a0seminar entitled \u201cMoney and Payments in the Digital Age\u201d that featured Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, a board member of the European Central Bank (ECB); Central Bank of Kenya Governor Patrick Njoroge; JPMorgan Chase Chief Financial Officer Sarah Youngwood; and Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of crypto finance firm Circle. Predictably, speakers who represented established financial institutions and the fintech entrepreneur offered vastly different opinions on whether the digital payments model is superior.\nWhile JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Youngwood touted the bank\u2019s new\u00a0digital coin that is used for instantaneous settlement of wholesale payments, the Central Bank of Kenya\u2019s chief talked about mobile-based payment service M-Pesa and ECB\u2019s C\u0153ur\u00e9 introduced\u00a0TIPS \u2014 a cost-efficient European service for the settlement of instant payments. Allaire, on his part,\u00a0painted a future marked by a \u201cfundamental redesign of how civic societies work,\u201d in which economic activity is fully automated, effectively eliminating the notion of payments as we now think of them. Notably, he argued that not only the decentralized forms of money underlain by permissionless public ledgers would benefit from the internet-like open design, but sovereign digital money would as well.\nC\u0153ur\u00e9 \u2014 the same ECB official who once had reportedly called bitcoin \u201cthe evil spawn of the financial crisis\u201d \u2014 expressed confidence that central bank-issued digital money would be prominent in the financial system of the future, but warned that \u201cdecentralization, if not properly managed, can introduce fragility\u201d to the system.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde along with Jeremy Allaire, Benoit Coeure, Patrick Njoroge and Sarah Youngwood talk about Money and Payments in the Digital Age at the IMF Headquarters during the 2019 IMF/World Bank Spring Meetings on April 10, 2019 in Washington, D.C. IMF Staff Photograph/Stephen Jaffe\nAn overarching motif that loomed large in almost every speaker\u2019s account was trust. However, if Circle\u2019s Allaire was talking about trust in open networks based on public infrastructure for money, in which clearance and settlement are decentralized, other panelists obviously meant a different kind of trust \u2014 i.e., trust in the incumbent financial institutions that has to be maintained and preserved.\nIn an interview after the panel, Madame Lagarde made a nod to blockchain \u201cdisruptors,\u201d who are \u201cclearly shaking the system\u201d and \u201cchanging business models of commercial banks.\u201d Yet, she sounded much more in line with C\u0153ur\u00e9 than with Allaire when she remarked that she remains concerned about the trust and stability of the system, and that the IMF doesn\u2019t want \u201cinnovation that would threaten stability.\u201d\nInterestingly, the IMF head noted, apparently in response to Allaire\u2019s mention that Facebook was expected to roll out its own coin soon, that the organization is watching \u201cdata collectors\u201d entering the financial space and is ready to regulate. The remark could be relevant to social services with payment ambitions beyond just Facebook, particularly the Telegram Open Network.\n\u201cNew Economy Talk: CBDC: Should Central Banks Issue Digital Currencies?\u201d was another\u00a0event among the Spring Meetings germane to the domain of crypto. Moderated by Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli \u2014 the deputy division chief in the IMF\u2019s Money and Capital Markets Department \u2014 the event had Deputy Governor Cecilia Skingsley of the Swedish Riksbank and Bank of Canada\u2019s Deputy Governor Timothy Lane pondering the prospects of digitizing sovereign money.\nIn this discussion, the word \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d was mentioned just once, yet in a rather revealing context. When talking about the possible design and functionality of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), Riksbank\u2019s Skingsley contended that such an instrument will have to be highly functional and the best at fulfilling citizens\u2019 needs \u2014 otherwise, \u201cother versions of money could come in, perhaps cryptocurrency,\u201d implying that government-issued digital money would stand in direct competition with its decentralized counterpart.\nLane expressed a number of concerns over the potential tokenization of central banks\u2019 liabilities, including systemic risks like facilitating bank runs and displacing financial intermediation. He also pointed out that, with the existing cryptocurrencies, \u201canonymity is a big issue\u201d and any digital instrument that Canada would develop will ensure that law enforcement has access to transacting parties\u2019 data, if needed. By and large, the discussion proceeded along the lines of designing a convenient digital reincarnation of fiat money rather than envisioning paradigmatic changes in the nature of state-issued money that a crypto-libertarian would welcome.\nInsights from Finance and Development\nThe ideas on digital money that most of the financial world\u2019s notables expressed on the floor of the IMF-hosted forum largely resonate with those articulated in the June 2018\u00a0issue of the organization\u2019s quarterly magazine, \u201cFinance and Development,\u201d dedicated almost entirely to the future of currency, and heavily focused on the threats and promises of blockchain. This issue \u2014 which, at the time of publication, did not make too much of a splash in the crypto community \u2014 is nevertheless a remarkable document that captures some themes that seem to remain influential with many financial bosses up to this day.\n\nTitle page of the June 2018 issue of Finance and Development, a magazine released and published by the International Monetary Fund\nSome of the points that the authors raise are hardly shocking. Martin M\u00fchleisen, director of the IMF\u2019s Strategy, Policy and Review Department,\u00a0acknowledges blockchain\u2019s capacity to revolutionize the world of finance, but reiterates common concerns over its potential to facilitate illicit activities. Andreas Adriano, a senior communications officer in the IMF\u2019s Communications Department,\u00a0applies Ken Galbraith\u2019s taxonomy of financial bubbles to what he calls \u201ccrypto euphoria,\u201d observing that most of the common features of historic financial euphorias are also visible in the irrational exuberance surrounding crypto assets.\nIn their primer on cryptocurrencies, economist Antoine Bouveret and the assistant director of the IMF\u2019s Strategy, Policy and Review Department, Vikram Haksar,\u00a0point out that such assets are often costly to produce and that \u201cdecentralized issuance implies that there is no entity backing the asset.\u201d They also mention that crypto assets might pose a threat to central banks\u2019 ability to conduct monetary policy by weakening their centralized control over the money supply.", "birthday": "2019-04-23T16:13:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-23 15:13:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 23}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/thailand-is-opening-up-to-crypto-one-step-closer-to-ico-and-sto", "title": " Thailand Is Opening Up to Crypto, One Step Closer to ICO and STO ", "content": "Since July, Thailand and its Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have voiced their intent to legalize the local initial coin offering (ICO) market and open it to startups.\nOn Dec. 1, 2018, however, Cointelegraph reported that the Thai SEC declared Thai-related security token offerings (STOs) in international markets to be illegal and said that it will take appropriate legal action against companies that attempt to distribute STOs created in Thailand to overseas markets.\nTipsuda Thavaramara, the deputy secretary of the Thai SEC, reportedly said:\n\u201cThe regulator will have to consider how to deal with STOs for issues such as share ownership, voting rights and dividend. At the moment, we have not decided whether STOs fall under the SEC Act or the Digital Asset Act, but it depends on the STO's conditions and the details in its white paper.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s initial stance toward the approval of STOs in the local market contradicted the Thai SEC\u2019s plans to legalize ICOs and allow companies to raise capital from investors in the public market.\nThis month, the Thai SEC reportedly approved the launch of the country\u2019s first ICO portal, with plans to approve an ICO project in the near future.\nArchari Suppiroj, the director of the fintech department at the SEC, said\u00a0that the launch of the ICO portal could lead to the approval of STOs in the local market:\n\u201cThe next step is for an issuer to offer security tokens in the primary market.\u201d\nImportance of STOs on foreign investment\nAndreessen Horowitz, billionaire investor Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund and several more major venture capital firms have funded security token projects throughout the past year, betting largely on the value security tokens with high liquidity and fungibility can bring.\nJosh Stein, the CEO of Harbor, which raised $28 million from Andreessen Horowitz, said that no major regulators and government agencies that the company has engaged in discussions with in the past several months have expressed a negative sentiment toward well-structured security tokens.\nHe said that, primarily because STOs are strictly regulated investment vehicles that are fully compliant with local regulations, governments are generally open toward regulating the security token market.\nPlacing an emphasis on the absence of legal boundaries between STOs and global financial regulations, Stein said:\n\u201cThere\u2019s a misconception that there\u2019s a regulatory problem or that somehow the regulations need to change. They don\u2019t. You need to comply with rules around the world. If the compliance doesn\u2019t work, nothing else can happen. We have talked with a number of regulators in the U.S. and around the world. No one has given us negative feedback and no one has signed off on it, but our fundamental opinion is that we\u2019re complying with the rules.\u201d\nAssets that are represented by STOs are real-world assets that are tangible and can be approved by the authorities. Security tokens merely offer a cryptographic representation and a proof of ownership, which, as a result, increase the liquidity and fungibility of the physical asset.\nTraditional assets, like properties and artwork, can be represented by tokens using a cryptographically encrypted blockchain network, allowing investors to obtain ownership of certain assets by purchasing tokens.\nSecurity tokens enable investors to purchase a portion of an asset without having the pressure of wholly acquiring it. One of the major reasons cryptocurrencies have appealed to millennials since early 2017 is the ability for young investors to invest a small amount in digital assets. With real estate and many other physical assets, it is not possible to do so.\n\nEven when security tokens are utilized in complex deals, it is possible for the issuer to freeze trading on a certain security token asset upon the request of the government and move back to paper. While it leads to administrative expenses and reputational exposure, the government and the security token operator can cooperate to create a physical version of the security token if an issue were to arise.\nWith no major regulatory boundaries and with significant benefits in liquidity, fungibility and transportability, investors that have been involved in the traditional financial sector \u2014 like Hong Joon-ki, the CEO of over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency exchange Cumberland Korea \u2014 have said that, eventually, various assets like artwork, real estate, sports teams and hedge funds will be tokenized:\n\u201cThe global cryptocurrency sector will rapidly change to security tokens at an exponential rate. Venture funds, hedge funds, sports teams, artworks, real estate, and a variety of real world assets will be tokenized on the blockchain. Currently, the majority of financial institutions entering the cryptocurrency sector with the backing of institutional investors are driven by the potential of tokenized assets and security tokens. These institutions are expanding their operations rapidly by working with cryptocurrency researchers and blockchain technology startups.\u201d\nState of Thai regulation\nDespite the shifting trend toward security tokens and the rising interest in tokenized assets in the global market, the current regulatory landscape of Thailand\u2019s cryptocurrency market was nowhere close to permitting the distribution of regulated security tokens less than three months ago.\nIn July, the Thai SEC officially legalized registered ICOs, allowing companies to run token sales with guidance from the SEC. At the time, the Bangkok Post reported:\n\u201cThe SEC will allow seven cryptocurrencies, used for initial coin offerings (ICOs), to be traded as trading pairs. They are bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash, ethereum classic, litecoin, ripple, and stellar. [...] All market participants, including ICO issuers, digital exchanges, brokers and dealers involved with digital asset transactions, are required to register with the SEC within 90 days of the effective date. [...] The participants must also receive the Finance Ministry\u2019s approval to conduct digital asset business.\u201d\nThe implementation of a new policy regarding the legalization of regulated and registered ICO projects portrayed the willingness of the Thai government to facilitate the growth of local cryptocurrency startups, as long as their operations are in compliance with existing regulations.\nMore importantly, the decision of the Thailand SEC to facilitate the needs of blockchain projects to conduct ICOs showed the intent of the government to help lay the groundwork for ICO and STO projects in the future.\nConceptually, security tokens are similar to registered ICOs in the sense that both are cryptographically encrypted assets that operate under the guidance of the Thai SEC, given that only registered companies that meet the SEC\u2019s criteria can run a token sale and that the sale is limited to accredited investors.\nThe open-minded approach toward ICO by the Thai government may translate to optimism toward security tokens, particularly because security tokens pose less threats to investors in the public market and to the government, since the authorities can exercise relatively strong control over security tokens.\nBased on the policies the Thai government has implemented since early 2018, the roadmap of the government seems to be to address every major problem from the ground up, beginning with the basics.\nIn May, the Thai authorities waived a 7% taxation rate for individual cryptocurrency investors, relieving pressure from investors who invest through local digital asset trading platforms. In the following month, the Thai SEC released a framework for legalizing registered ICOs. Then, in August, the government approved seven cryptocurrency companies to operate legally in the country, officially giving them the ability to sustain their operations without facing banking- and regulation-related issues.\nIf the government determines that basic issues in the cryptocurrency exchange market, ICO market, and taxation are addressed and sufficient investor protection is imposed, then the government could shift its attention to emerging sectors within the broader cryptocurrency space, including security tokens.\nOverall, Thailand is continuing to see some progress and changes in the local market in terms of regulation, adoption and growth. Merely eight months ago, ICOs were completely banned in Thailand, registered or not.\nWith the G-20\u2019s lead on cryptocurrency regulation, Thailand and other regions in Asia are expected to regulate their respective digital asset markets with stricter policies, and as a result, the Thai government could eventually get to security tokens in the long term.\n\nBut, in the near term, it is fairly unlikely that the Thai government will allow retail investors or individual investors to be involved in security tokens as of yet, especially during a period in which the United States, Japan and South Korea have yet to make any major move to adopt security tokens.\nChina\u2019s ban on STOs\nOn Dec. 1, less than 24 hours after Thailand issued a warning against security tokens, China imposed a blanket ban on security token offerings.\nHuo Xuewen, chief of Beijing\u2019s Municipal Bureau of Finance, said in a roughly translated statement:\n\u201cThe ICO model is being left behind for a new concept called STO. I want to issue a warning to anyone considering running an STO in Beijing. Don\u2019t do it in Beijing \u2014 it is illegal. You can only engage in such activities with approval from the government. You will be kicked out if you do it.\u201d\nSeven days following the release of Xuewen\u2019s statement, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) officially imposed a blanket ban on security tokens.\nAt an internet finance forum in Beijing, Pang Gongsheng, the deputy governor at PBoC, explicitly described that the act of offering security tokens is illegal under existing laws in China. A rough translation of Pang\u2019s statement reads:\n\u201cThe STO business that has surfaced recently is still essentially an illegal financial activity in China. [\u2026] Virtual money has become an accomplice to all kinds of illegal and criminal activities.\u201d", "birthday": "2019-04-20T11:40:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-20 10:40:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 20}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nAn extended downtrend usually goes through an accumulation phase before starting a new uptrend. Digital assets fund Adamant Capital believes that the crypto markets are currently going through that phase.\nCurrently, about 3% of American retirees have invested in Bitcoin, according to a recent survey.\u00a056.7% of the retirees have heard of Bitcoin, but are reluctant to invest. This might be due to the long and crushing bear market. When the markets start rising and enter a bull phase, many of these are likely to enter the markets. Clarity on regulations from the government will also result in greater participation. Andrew Yang \u2014 a United States Democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 elections \u2014 is in favor of implementing clear\u00a0regulations on digital assets.\nThe Chinese President Xi Jinping is bullish on the prospects of the blockchain technology for the future. Though cryptocurrency trading is banned in China, the ruling party sees the renminbi as a\u00a0cryptocurrency in about 20 years, according to Donald Tapscott, executive chairman of the Blockchain Research Institute. However, how much support a centralized cryptocurrency launched by a central bank will receive in the community is yet to be seen.\nXTZ/USD\nTezos (XTZ) was the best performer among the major cryptocurrencies in the past seven days. The market participants cheered the comments by French finance minister Bruno Le Maire on Tezos and the blockchain industry. In an interview to French magazine\u00a0Capital, the minister said that France is looking to invest over $4.5 billion euros in innovative industries, including blockchain, in the next five years. Is Tezos worth a buy even now or will it enter a correction? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe\u00a0XTZ/USD pair has seen a strong pullback from the lows. From a low of $0.33, it has risen to the current levels, which is a rise of over 300%.\nIt is presently trying to break out of the overhead resistance of $1.295480, but is facing resistance close to the 50-week SMA. The 20-week SMA has started to slope up and the RSI has jumped into the positive territory. This suggests that the bulls have the upper hand.\nWe anticipate a stiff resistance between the 50-week SMA and $1.85. After the sharp recovery from the lows, we anticipate a minor correction or consolidation. However, if the momentum pushes the price above $1.85, the rally can reach $2.75 and above it to $4.20.\nAfter a sharp run-up, it is always better to wait and enter on a consolidation or a minor dip.\nBNB/USD\nAnalysis by the Binance research team concluded that\u00a0the crypto winter might be coming to an end. We believe the resurgence is being led by binance coin (BNB), which is the best performer among major cryptocurrencies and might become the first to scale the highs made during the bull run in January of last year.\nCrypto exchange Binance earned\u00a0$78 million in profits in Q1 2019, a growth of 66% over the comparable quarter of the previous year. Binance CFO Wei Zhou said that the profits were\u00a0boosted by the surge in OTC trades. The exchange has launched its mainnet and plans to execute the swap of binance coin on\u00a0April 23. Also this week, Binance has started a campaign to\u00a0support the reconstruction of the Notre Dame Cathedral.\n\nThe\u00a0BNB/USD pair is on fire: it is close to breaking the previous high of $26.4732350 made in early January of 2018. This is a major sentiment booster as it gives confidence to the traders that the best is yet to come for the cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals.\nAs the pair moved up, it picked up momentum. While this is a bullish sign, it has also pushed the weekly RSI into deeply overbought zone. This increases the possibility of a minor correction or consolidation; however, it is difficult to time it. When the momentum is strong, overbought markets can become even more overbought.\nWhile the investors holding the cryptocurrency can stay put with an appropriate stop loss, it might be dicey to take a new position at the current levels, as the risk to reward ratio is not attractive.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin cash (BCH) was the main beneficiary of bitcoin SV\u2019s delisting by\u00a0major crypto\u00a0exchanges this week. In another move,\u00a0SBI Holdings has conversely said that it will delist bitcoin cash from its exchange in June 2019. The company has stated that the decision to\u00a0delist bitcoin cash was premeditated, and had nothing to do with its partnership with nChain (whose chief scientist, Craig Wright, is the founder of BSV).\n\nThe\u00a0BCH/USD pair had surged the week before. After the sharp move, the previous week saw mild correction. This week, the pair is again attempting to break out of the overhead resistance at $363.30.\nIf successful, it can move up to $451.32. The 50-week SMA is close to this level; hence, this might act as a resistance. But if the bulls breakout of this resistance zone, a rally to $600 can be on the cards.\nMeanwhile, the 20-week EMA is flat and the RSI is close to the center. This points to a consolidation for a few more weeks. However, if the bears sink the digital currency below the support zone of $255 and the 20-week EMA, a fall to $166.25 is probable.\nETH/USD\nCryptocurrency exchange Coincheck has\u00a0added ether (ETH) to its over-the-counter offering. Ethereum core developers are\u00a0debating whether more frequent and smaller hard forks are better than the larger and less frequent hard forks. The decentralized platform needs to be on its toes to ward off the increasing competition.\n\nThe\u00a0ETH/USD pair is facing a stiff tussle between the bears and the bulls at the critical $167.32 level. While the bulls scaled this level in the week before, completing an ascending triangle pattern, they could not build up on the gains.\nLast week, the bears attempted to sink the pair back into the triangle. This week, the bulls are again trying to keep the price above $167.32.", "birthday": "2019-04-21T08:05:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-21 07:05:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 21}

BSV is famously backed by Craig Wright, an Australian entrepreneur, chief scientist at his startup called nChain and self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto.\nAfter Binance, one of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges, decided to delist BSV amid Wright\u2019s campaign to deanonymize one of his critics, other major platforms \u2014 including ShapeShift and Kraken \u2014 followed suit.\nAs a result, the price of BSV tanked. Meanwhile, Wright and his team have purportedly served some of their critics with court documents, demanding public apologies.\n#WeAreAllHodlonaut: How Wright has enraged the crypto community\nThe delisting marathon was preceded by Craig Wright\u2019s run-in with an anonymous Twitter personality nicknamed Hodlonaut, who also organized the Lightning Torch campaign. According to crypto news outlet Coingeek (founded by billionaire Calvin Ayre, who has been vocal about his support for BSV), Hodlonaut targeted the Australian businessman with offensive tweets, calling him \u201ca very sad and pathetic scammer. Clearly mentally ill,\u201d and allegedly participating in the creation of the #CraigWrightIsAFraud hashtag.\nWhile Craig Wright has repeatedly claimed that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, much of the cryptocurrency community seems skeptical about those statements, widely referring to Wright as \u201cfaketoshi.\u201d Back in December 2015, Wired and Gizmodo reported that the Australian computer scientist might be the creator of bitcoin (BTC), but a substantial part of the evidence presented in the reports \u2014 both of which cited an anonymous source who had contacted them voluntarily \u2014 was soon proved false. Wired subsequently assumed that Wright \u201cwas likely pulling an elaborate hoax or con\u201d to present himself as Satoshi to the public.\nOn April 11, Coingeek went as far as to set a $5,000 bounty in BSV for information regarding the true identity of Hodlnaut, while also demanding that the Twitter user should publicly apologize to Wright both on the social media platform and during an open court hearing. The article contained informal language, alleged pictures of Hodlonaut, his or her approximate location, and explicitly called for deanonymization:\n\u201cWright is demanding that the individual behind the @Hodlonaut account tweet an apology to him, make a statement in open court apologizing to Wright and acknowledge the falsity of the allegations made against Wright. Instead, Hodlonaut seems to have hidden under his mother\u2019s skirt and is nowhere to be found.\u201d\nHodlonaut has since deleted his or her Twitter account. In response, the cryptocurrency community on Twitter began trending a #WeAreAllHodlonaut hashtag to show support. Moreover, an eponymous website was created to crowdfund BTC in order to help Hodlonaut fund his or her legal battle with Wright. According to the information posted on the website, the pseudonymous Twitter user had received a letter from Wright\u2019s legal team before erasing his or her online presence. In it, Wright\u2019s lawyers were allegedly threatening to sue Hodlonaut for defamation in a United Kingdom court (as per Wright\u2019s LinkedIn profile, the Australian entrepreneur currently resides in London. According to earlier reports, he lived in Sydney, and local police had raided his house).\nAs of press time, more than $28,700 has been raised via weareallhodlonaut.com, which is more than 140% of the initial goal of $20,000. The website states that Hodlonaut personally controls the funds from this campaign and that any excess contributions will be sent to Bitcoin Venezuela, the same charity-focused organization that received donations from the Lightning Torch campaign.\nCointelegraph has reached out to Preston Byrne, an attorney at Byrne & Storm and who claims be to handling Hodlonaut\u2019s case pro bono, but he declined to comment.\nNotably, earlier in March of this year, not long before erasing his presence on Twitter himself, Wright tweeted that he will be \u201ctaking action aggressively to remove any site that is in error or makes false claims,\u201d referring to people calling him a fraud, among other things. \u00a0\n\u201cYou do not have a right to lies under \u2018free speech\u2019 nor harassment, nor libel and slander,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf an error is reported in a malicious context concerning me, expect to be living in a barrel when we finish with you.\u201d\nPeter McCormack, the host of the podcast \u201cWhat Bitcoin Did,\u201d is another person who has reportedly been approached by Wright\u2019s legal team. According to McCormack\u2019s tweets, after he tagged Calvin Ayre\u2019s account to declare that Wright is a fraud and provided his personal address in Bedford, U.K. for legal correspondence, he allegedly received a letter from SCA Ontier LLP, a London-based law firm. In it, like in the case of Hodlonaut, he was asked to publicly apologize to Wright both on Twitter and in court.\nMoreover, Wright\u2019s attorney reportedly stated that his client \u201chas not fraudulently claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto\u201d since his client allegedly is Satoshi Nakamoto. The statement further claims that Wright wrote bitcoin\u2019s original white paper, sent the first bitcoin transaction and played an integral role in the network\u2019s development.\nMcCormack then shared what he calls his \u201cformal response,\u201d where he declined to apologize to Wright and asked him to provide evidence that would confirm that he is Satoshi Nakamoto. On April 18, McCormack was allegedly served with a service claim for 100,000 British pounds (around $130,000).\nSeamus Andrew, managing partner at SCA ONTIER LLP, has verified to Cointelegraph that his firm represents Craig Wright and that they are in the process of taking legal action, but did not specify whether or not they were suing McCormack or Hodlonaut.\n\u201cI confirm that we act for Craig Wright, and that we are in the process of bringing legal proceedings against certain individuals and entities who have defamed our client,\u201d Andrew said via email.\nCointelegraph has requested for a comment from McCormack to clarify the details of his case, however, as of press time, he has not replied.\nBinance, ShapeShift, Kraken and other platforms have delisted BSV\nThe situation escalated on April 11, when Changpeng Zhao, founder and CEO of Binace \u2014 currently the world\u2019s fourth-largest crypto exchange by adjusted daily trade volume \u2014 warned that he would delist BSV (which trades under the ticker BCHSV on the platform) if the creator of the altcoin \u2014 i.e., Craig Wright \u2014 does not correct his behavior. The tweet seemed like a reaction to Wright\u2019s action against Hodlnaut:\n\u201cCraig Wright is not Satoshi. Anymore of this sh!t, we delist!\u201d\nThe community reacted to Zhao\u2019s warning by asking various exchanges to delist BSV and by kick-starting a #DelistBSV hashtag.\nOn April 15, Binance officially announced that it will delist BSV. Specifically, the exchange stated that, as of April 22, it will delist the altcoin and cease trading all of its trading pairs. In the accompanying statement, Binance explained that it regularly reviews assets listed on its platform \u201cto ensure that it [the asset] continues to meet the high level of standard we expect.\u201d The firm went on to explain that it only delists a coin after a second in-depth review, noting, \u201cWe believe this best protects all of our users.\u201d\nThus, the exchange listed the responsiveness to its due diligence requests, the level and quality of the coin\u2019s development, as well as \u201cevidence of unethical / fraudulent conduct\u201d among the factors that it takes into account before delisting a cryptocurrency.\nLater, on April 15, anonymous exchange ShapeShift and crypto data supplier and cryptocurrency wallet Blockchain.com also announced they were dropping BSV. On Twitter, ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees confirmed that the company came to a decision to stop listing the altcoin for reasons similar to those of Binance:\n\u201cWe stand with @binance and CZ's sentiments. We\u2019ve decided to delist Bitcoin SV #BSV from @ShapeShift_io within 48 hrs.\u201d\nOther crypto platforms took a slightly different approach, letting their users decide whether to delist or keep BSV via Twitter polls. For instance, instant crypto exchange service ChangeNow wrote:\n\u201cAs a service strongly disagree with Craig Stephen Wright's policies and business decisions - everything, really.\nHowever, we believe that the @BitcoinSVNode community should not suffer because of some decisions one man made.\nSo, do you think we should #DelistBSV? $BSV #BSV\u201d\nSimilarly, major United States crypto exchange Kraken has decided to delist BSV following the results of a Twitter poll. In the official press release, the platform said that BSV had \u201cengaged in behavior completely antithetical to everything we at Kraken and the wider crypto community stands for.\u201d\nBSV price had tanked as much as 20% following the series of delisting announcements, according to data obtained from CoinMarketCap, but currently shows signs of a slight recovery. As of press time, it is trading around $60, gaining back around 5% during the past few days.\nNotably, the delisting announcements drew a negative response from some community members. \u201cI have no love for bsv but I also take no joy in seeing a biased, bot infested platform like twitter being used to shut coins down with the impression they are democratic votes on a unbiased platform,\u201d a Redditor wrote on the r/btc subreddit.\n\u201cDelisting bitcoin SV from some of the popular exchanges certainly was harmful to the project,\u201d Matthew Greenspan, eToro senior market analyst, told Cointelegraph over Skype after a warning that it was difficult for him to comment on the case since he knew Hodlonaut and participated in the Lightning Torch experiment. \u00a0\n\u201cI would say it was a slap to bitcoin SV and its founders. [\u2026] Some of their opinions and threats have been extremely unpopular in the crypto community,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it will be harder for people to buy and sell it [BSV], and it will be harder for it to gain real liquidity in the market.\u201d Greenspan also added that the results of the polls held by Kraken and other crypto platforms are \u201cself-evident.\u201d\nWright\u2019s company, nChain, which designed bitcoin SV and is responsible for its technical development, has denounced the #DelistBSV campaign. \u201cThe sudden delisting of Bitcoin SV by some exchange is absolutely unjustifiable and sets a terrible precedent for the cryptocurrency industry,\u201d Jimmy Nguyen, the chairman of nChain, told Cointelegraph.\nAccording to Nguyen, the BSV network became much stronger after Binance, Kraken and other exchanges listed it on their platforms after November\u2019s hard fork of the BCH network. Since then, more mining pools, wallets, applications and services have begun working with BSV, nChain\u2019s chairman added, while the daily average block size of BSV was increased as well, showing technical development of the altcoin. \u201cTherefore, there is even more reason to list BSV, not delist it,\u201d Nguyen argued.\n\u201cThe delisting decision is driven by personal dislike of Craig Wright and retaliation for steps Craig has taken to pursue personal legal rights against people he believes are defaming him,\u201d Nguyen said. That, according to him, is a menacing sign for the community:\n\u201cA dangerous precedent has been set if an exchange uses its CEO\u2019s personal dislike of a coin\u2019s individual supporter as the reason to make delisting decisions. What if one day Vitalik Buterin took personal actions that offended an exchange CEO? Should that be the basis to delist Ethereum?\u201d Nguyen asked. \u201cWhether you agree with Craig Wright\u2019s personal legal actions or not, Craig\u2019s invoking of legal remedies are for a court of law to decide \u2014 not crypto exchanges.\u201d\nThe nChain chairman also criticized the idea of using Twitter polls to decide whether to delist BSV, calling it \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u00a0He went on, saying:\n\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine the Twitter polls are just providing cover for a delisting decision already made. Twitter polls are not even limited to the exchanges\u2019 customers, can be easily manipulated by bots and multiple anonymous accounts, and create the climate for mob rule. I expect regulators around the world to take a critical look at this Twitter poll charade.\u201d\nWhen asked whether he condones Wright\u2019s behavior, Nguyen repiled:\n\u201cLike every person, Craig is entitled to invoke whatever legal rights are available to him, and let the legal system decide. He is defending himself after years of cyber bullying. Craig now simply wants a court of law, rather than the Twitter-sphere or exchange CEOs, to decide.\u201d\nAlternative measures: Some platforms kept BSV or even delisted BCH instead for political reasons", "birthday": "2019-04-20T22:21:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-20 21:21:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 20}

The department noted that the move marks its first such enforcement action, thus setting a precedent. The defendant \u2014 Eric Powers of Kern County, California \u2014 has been fined $35,000 and debarred from future work that qualifies as a money services business.

McCormack had previously accused Wright of fraud and falsely claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin (BTC). In response, Wright\u2019s claim allegedly requests over $130,000 in damages, as well as legal costs and court fees.

These are usually incorporated into a Complaint or other legal document.Exhibit (Ex.): Exhibits are physical or documentary evidence attached to a Complaint, or other legal document that serves to be brought before a jury. Examples may include another document, photograph, video recording, or even a physical item.Idem (Id.): Idem, or \u201cid,\u201d is a Latin term meaning \u201cthe same,\u201d commonly abbreviated to \u201cid,\u201d which is particularly used in legal citations to denote the previously cited source. This helps to save time/space by directing readers to the previously cited source, if the writer is still referring to that source.Paragraph (\u00b6): The \u201cpilcrow\u201d symbol, also known as the paragraph mark, is a typographical character referencing individual paragraphs. When referring to multiple paragraphs, usually two pilcrows are used, \u00b6\u00b6.Section (\u00a7): The section symbol refers to a particular section, either in a book or more commonly, legal documents or statutes. For example, \u00a715, means \u201csection 15\u201d of that particular document.\nWhat did ATB Coin do wrong?\nPursuant to the Complaint was that ATB Coin LLC (\u201cATB/Defendants\u201d) held itself out as a technology start-up company established for the purposes of facilitating rapid, low-cost digital financing transactions through revolutionary blockchain technology (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3,15-16).\nFrom June 12, 2017 through September 15, 2017, ATB conducted an initial coin offering, or \u201cICO,\u201d through which ATB offered digital \u201cATB coins\u201d to the general public in exchange for other digital assets (the \u201cATB ICO\u201d) (Id. \u00b62).\nDefendants promoted the ATB coin as \u201can innovative decentralized cryptocurrency incorporating the advanced technologies that tailor the needs of primary market players\u2014users, investors, and business owners.\u201d (4/27/18 Kupka Decl. Ex. 1, at 2).\nThe ATB coin was \u201cdesigned to overcome well-known inefficiencies within government central banks and other cryptocurrencies [and to] induce [\u2026] transactions that are fully secure, private, and anonymous.\u201d (Id.)\nThe primary purpose of the ATB ICO, according to Defendants, was to raise capital to enable Defendants to create and launch a new blockchain (the \u201cATB Blockchain\u201d) on which the ATB coins would operate (Compl. \u00b6 3). During the ICO, Defendants issued a range of promotional materials describing the ATB ICO as an \u201cinvestment opportunity.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 33; see also id. \u00b6 4).\nWhen the ATB ICO launched in June 2017, Defendants offered one (1) ATB coin for $1, payable in the cryptocurrencies bitcoin (\u201cBTC\u201d), ether (\u201cETH\u201d), or litecoin (\u201cLTC\u201d) (Id. \u00b6 5). As the price increased $1.50 three months later, all market participants in the ICO continued to receive a certain number of additional ATB coins as a bonus (Id. \u00b6 37).\nOn August 21, 2017, Plaintiff Raymond Balestra (\u201cPlaintiff\u201d) participated in the ATB ICO, purchasing 388.5 ATB coins in exchange for 2.100441 ETH (Id. \u00b6 13; id. Ex. 1). In total, the ATB ICO raised over $20 million from thousands of investors (Compl. \u00b6 2).\nWhile the Defendants launched the ATB Blockchain on September 14, 2017, at the close of the ATB ICO, it was not capable of the technological feats that Defendants had advertised.\nBy March 11, 2018, the value of Plaintiff\u2019s ATB coins had decreased by more than 85% from the price at which he purchased them (Id. Ex. 1; Lead Pl. Br. 5).\nWhat brings Defendants into Court for this pending class-action suit, is that Defendants did not file a registration statement for the ATB ICO with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) at any point, either before, during, or after the ICO (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 9, 55-57).\nConsequently, Plaintiff filed his Complaint on December 21, 2017, alleging two claims against Defendants under the U.S. Securities Act.\nGoing down the legal rabbit hole\nIn its putative class-action complaint, Plaintiffs alleged two violations of the Securities Act:\nPursuant to \u00a712(a), Defendants offered and sold unregistered securities in the form of ATB coins, andPursuant to \u00a715(a), ATB\u2019s co-founders, Edward Ng and Herbert W. Hoover III, as \u201ccontrol persons\u201d of ATB. \u00a0\nDefendants filed their Motion to Dismiss for:\nLack of personal jurisdiction (Federal Rule Civ. Procedure, 12[b][2]), andFailure to state a claim, on the theory that ATB coins were not \u201csecurities\u201d based on the pleadings, pursuant to 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n#1 \u2014 Debunking the \u201cjurisdictional\u201d argument\nIn their Motion to Dismiss, Defendants claimed there was a \u201clack of personal jurisdiction.\u201d\nWhen a defendant moves for dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (\u201cFRCP\u201d), the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the court has jurisdiction over the defendant.\nFor more than 70 years, U.S. courts have relied upon the \u201cMinimum Contacts\u201d standard established in the 1945 case, Int\u2019l Shoe Co. v. Washington, for determining whether personal jurisdiction exists.\nUnder the Minimum Contacts test, a court will look to the amount of contact a person (natural born or business) has had with that court\u2019s forum state, to ensure hailing them into court there is fair and justified.\nWith respect to Defendant\u2019s argument, the Court referred to a number of New York conferences that Ng and Hoover had attended, in efforts to promote the sale of ATB coins to U.S. investors.\nAccording to one of the company\u2019s press releases, ATB Coin\u2019s co-founder, Herbert W. Hoover III, is a member of America\u2019s iconic manufacturing family who resides in New York and travels worldwide.\nTherefore, the Court quickly dismissed Defendant\u2019s argument, holding that there was more than sufficient contact with the state of New York.\n#2 \u2014 Was the ATB Coin token sale a \u201csecurities offering\u201d under U.S. securities law?\nSince 1946, the U.S. Supreme Court case, SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., continues to remain the leading standard in U.S. securities law for determining whether or not a transaction is considered to be an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d (securities offering), or a \u201ccommodity\u201d under the U.S. Securities Act.\nAn investment contract implies that the transaction is a type of security.\nIn the world of blockchain technology and digital currencies, the Howey Test comprises of three elements:\nWas there an investment of money?Was there a common enterprise?Was there an expectation of profits predominantly from the efforts of others?\nFor a token or coin to be considered a \u201csecurity\u201d under Howey, all three elements must be met.\nThe third element of this standard encompasses both the third and fourth prongs of the traditional Howey Test.\nWas there an \u201cinvestment of money\u201d?\nAs for the first element of the test, there was no dispute among the parties that money was invested into this venture.\nThe issue in this case revolves around the second and third elements of the test.\nWas there a \u201ccommon enterprise\u201d?\nThe Defendants argued that there was no common enterprise to subject them to the requirements of Howey.\nHowever, the Court disagreed. It found that \u201cDefendants encouraged investors to purchase ATB Coins based on the claim that the speed and efficiency of the ATB Blockchain would result in an increase in the coins\u2019 value.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t matter that the coins never entitled the purchaser to a pro rata share of ATB\u2019s profits. Rather, the Court sided with SEC precedent, that an ICO can be a securities offering even where the offer does not provide for a pro rata distribution of profits.\nAt the end of the day, the success of ATB coins was built upon the success of the ATB enterprise, establishing \u201chorizontal commonality.\u201d\nWas there an \u201cexpectation of profits predominantly from the efforts of others\u201d?\nYes. The Court pointed to the complaint, which in its belief, sufficiently alleged that the buyers\u2019 profits were based on ATB\u2019s efforts.\nIn addition to the SEC Consent Order, \u201c2017 In Re Munchee,\u201d the Court looked to the company\u2019s press releases and FAQs \u2014 persuasive authority, to help expand on its analysis. Quite literally, the company stated that the coins were a kind of \u201cinvestment\u201d \u2014", "birthday": "2019-04-22T08:55:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-22 07:55:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 22}

It is interesting to note that the most common crypto investors are in their 50s, followed by the 30\u201340 age group. This shows that crypto has touched one and all. \u00a0\nFundstrat Global Advisors founder Tom Lee expects a bull market to start in Bitcoin. His assumption is based on the reading of the Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI), that is at levels not seen in this bear phase. The BMI reading has skyrocketed to 89, which is way above the previous high of 67. However, such elevated levels have previously resulted in a correction, averaging about 25%. Therefore, Lee expects a drop in Bitcoin but remains bullish as he expects the price to turn around and reach new highs once again. Unlike previous occasions, he has not committed to a specific time frame for a new high.\nWhat does our analysis say? Let\u2019s find out.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) is trading close to the overhead resistance of $5,404.82. A breakout of this level can push the price towards the next overhead resistance zone of $5,674.84\u2013$5,900. We anticipate a stiff resistance at $5,900, hence, traders can book profits on 50% of their remaining long positions above $5,600 and keep the stop loss on the rest at $4,800. Both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which confirms that the bulls are in command.\n\nContrary to our expectation, if the BTC/USD pair reverses direction from either of the overhead resistances, it can again correct to $4,914.11. This is a strong support. The pair remains positive as long as the price sustains above this.\nBut if the bears sink the digital currency below $4,914, it will be a spoiler and can result in a quick fall to $4,255. We expect a large range move within the next 3\u20134 days.\nETH/USD\nThe bulls are unable to push Ethereum (ETH) above the overhead resistance of $187.98. This suggests profit booking closer to $180. However, the positive thing is that the price has sustained above $167.32 for the past four days. The 20-day EMA is also close to this level, hence, we expect the bulls to defend it strongly.\n\nA rebound from the current levels will again try to rise above the overhead resistance of $187.98. If successful, a rally to $251.64 is likely. There are slew of resistances between $220 and $251.64. Hence, we might suggest booking profits on the position if we find the ETH/USD pair struggling to move up.\nContrary to our assumption, if the bears sink the pair below the 20-day EMA, it can fall to the 50-day SMA. Therefore, traders can keep their stop loss on the remaining long positions at $150. With both the moving averages sloping up and the RSI in positive territory, the path of least resistance is to the upside.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) again took support at the 50-day SMA on April 21. Currently, the bulls are attempting to hold this level. Both the moving averages are flat and the RSI has dipped into the negative territory. This points to a balance between the buyers and sellers.\n\nIf the bulls provide buying support at the current levels and carry the XRP/USD pair above $0.34835, it can move up to $0.38. The pair will pick up momentum if it breaks out of the overhead resistance at $0.40. We suggest long positions on a breakout above $0.35. The stop loss can be kept at $0.31.\nOn the other hand, if the bears sink the digital currency below the 50-day SMA, it can drop to the next support of $0.27795.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has dipped to the 20-day EMA where buying has emerged. However, the bulls have not been able to push the price higher. This shows the probability of a breakdown below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the digital currency can drop to the critical support of $255.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is gradually dropping towards the center. This suggests that the pair might remain range bound for a few more days.\nBut if the BCH/USD pair rebounds sharply from the current levels, it can move up to $363.30. If this level is crossed, it is likely to pick up momentum and rally to $451.32.\nEOS/USD\nAfter holding the 20-day EMA for the past few days, EOS plunged below it on April 21. However, a small consolation is that the price rebounded from the lows and closed at the 20-day EMA on that day.\n\nCurrently, the bulls are again trying to push the price back above the 20-day EMA. If successful, the digital currency will try to move up to $6.0726 and above it to $6.8299. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is just above 50, which suggests that the bulls have a minor advantage.\nBut if the bulls fail to sustain the EOS/USD pair above the 20-day EMA, it might dip to the 50-day SMA. The zone between $4.4930 and $3.8723 is a critical one. We anticipate buying in this zone. We shall wait for the pair to rebound from the supports or wait for a breakout above $6.8299 before recommending a trade in it.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) had been trading in a tight range of $74.6054\u2013$84.3439 for the past few days. On April 21, though the bears broke below the support of the range, they could not sustain it. At close (UTC time frame), the price was back in the range. This suggests demand at lower levels. Currently, the bulls are attempting to sustain the price in the range. \u00a0\n\nThe 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is close to the midpoint. This indicates equilibrium between the buyers and the sellers.\nA breakout and close above $84.3439 will tilt the advantage in favor of the bulls. Therefore, we retain the buy recommendation given in the previous analysis. However, if the bears sink the LTC/USD pair below $73, a fall to the 50-day SMA is probable.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) is trading near lifetime highs. Though it did not make a new high on April 20, it came very close. The positive thing is that it has not given up much ground since then, which shows that the bulls are not booking profits aggressively as they expect higher levels.\n\nBoth the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI continues to trade in the overbought zone. This shows that the bulls are in command. If the BNB/USD pair breaks out and sustains above the previous lifetime high of $26.4732350, it will be a bullish sign. The next target on the upside is $32.\nHowever, if the pair makes a new high but fails to sustain it, that will be an indication of profit booking at higher levels. It will turn negative on a breakdown below the 50-day SMA. Though bullish, we do not find a trade set up that has a good risk to reward ratio. Hence, we are not suggesting a trade in it.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) has declined to the 50-day SMA, which is likely to provide some support. The 20-day EMA is gradually turning down and the RSI has fallen into the negative zone. This suggests that the bears are making a comeback.\n\nIf the XLM/USD pair breaks down and closes below the immediate support of $0.1090, the fall can extend to the uptrend line. This is a critical support. If this is breached, it will complete a breakdown of the wedge, which is a negative sign.\nOn the upside, the pair will show signs of strength on a breakout and close above $0.12039489. However, we shall wait for the price to sustain above the downtrend line and the overhead resistance of $0.14861760 before turning positive.\nADA/USD\nCardano (ADA) has broken down of the critical support of $0.075920. It can now slide to the 50-day SMA, which might act as a strong support. The 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI has dropped below 50. This suggests that the bears are at an advantage in the short term.\n", "birthday": "2019-04-22T19:45:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-22 18:45:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 22}

When it comes to futures, traders may benefit from being able to buy or sell crypto at a preagreed-upon price on a fixed date in time. These contracts enable them to lock in the value and secure some uncertainty in an unpredictable market.\nThey can also be useful from a speculation perspective, especially if a trader believes that the value of a cryptocurrency is going to rise or fall in future. However, derivatives are not without their risks. While traders are paid the price difference by a broker when their analysis is correct, they would have to compensate the broker if the asset\u2019s value went the other way.\nOne of the main challenges when dealing in crypto derivatives is making sure that prices on brokerage platforms is up to date.\nLiquid says that its new service, Liquid Infinity, has been specifically tailored to the needs of professional traders.

While the details are still sketchy \u2014 for instance, it is unclear whether or not it was an inside job, as Bithumb initially claimed \u2014 a large portion of the stolen funds have been frozen by various exchanges who received them from hackers attempting to sell the loot.\nHowever, despite Bithumb stressing that the hijacked assets belonged to the company and not to its clients, the customers still can\u2019t access their funds, since withdrawals and deposits have been disabled as part of the security measures. \u00a0\nBithumb reportedly lost 3 million EOS and 20 million XRP, claims it was an inside job\nOn March 29, Bithumb experienced what it described as \u201cabnormal withdrawals\u201d through its monitoring system. Then, as per the company's manual, the exchange reportedly moved all remaining funds to a cold wallet. Additionally, deposits and withdrawals have been disabled on the platform for security reasons. In the accompanying blog post issued the day after the incident, Bithumb also assumed that the security breach was performed by insiders, citing the results of an internal inspection. \u00a0\u00a0\nMoreover, Bithumb blamed itself for the security breach. Specifically, the exchange team admitted that it only focused on protection from outside attacks and did not verify its staff, according to an announcement by the company. Bithumb also promised that the incident won\u2019t occur again, because a workforce verification system is allegedly already in the works.\n\u201cWe are working with major exchanges and foundations and expect to recover the loss of the cryptocurrency equivalent,\u201d Bithumb\u2019s statement reads. \u201cAlso we promise that we will open our progress clearly with social responsibility as a global leader company.\u201d\nInterestingly, while Bithumb never directly disclosed how much cryptocurrency was lifted in any updates regarding the hack, it has been established that more than 3 million EOS (about $12.5 million) were transferred from its hot wallet during the security breach. Moreover, according to cryptocurrency news outlet The Block, around 20 million XRP \u2014 the cryptocurrency created by Ripple \u2014 (equivalent to about $6.2 million) were also stolen.\nNotably, Bithumb has stressed that the embezzled funds were owned by the company and that all assets belonging to its users are now under the protection of a cold wallet, which allegedly has not been compromised.\nThus, deposits and withdrawals on Bithumb have been disabled for more than two weeks at this point, although the exchange has announced that it will start accepting deposits and withdrawals for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) \u201cwith enhanced security\u201d starting on April 17, 15:00 (presumably GMT+9). It is currently unclear if the trading has actually continued for those cryptocurrencies, as Bithumb has ignored Cointelegraph\u2019s requests for comment.\nNotably, earlier this year, South Korean tech news outlet ZDNet reported that Bithumb was one of just seven cryptocurrency exchanges that have passed a security audit performed by local regulators.\nMajor part of the stolen funds have been frozen by various exchanges\nAs mentioned above, Bithumb has insisted that the hijacked funds were entirely company-owned, and hence did not represent customers\u2019 assets. In an attempt to prove this, on April 11, the South Korean crypto exchange published what it presented as results of an alleged professional external audit of its funds conducted on April 8, a little over a week after the hack.\n\u201cWe have stated that we will conduct fair and objective due diligence on all assets that we have through a reliable external Audit,\u201d the statement reads, linking to the accounting firm\u2019s statistics. Bithumb\u2019s statement continued:\n\u201cWe are pleased to inform you that our members' valuable assets are managed and maintained in a systematic / safe manner through the attached due diligence report.\u201d\nNevertheless, the exchange\u2019s clients have been stripped of the option to withdraw their funds from the platform, because that option was disabled soon after the incident occurred. In one of the statements, Bithumb also claimed they were working with the Korean police, Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) and unspecified \u201csecurity companies\u201d to deal with the aftermath.\nThe news about the hack was initially broken by Dovey Wan, founding partner at blockchain-focused Primitive Ventures, who also tweeted that part of the stolen EOS had ended up on a number of exchanges, while another portion had been moved to other addresses. Thus, Wan wrote, the exchange that received the most funds (662,000 EOS) was Exmo, followed by Huobi (263,000 EOS), Changelly (192,000 EOS), ChangeNOW (140,000 EOS) and KuCoin (96,000 EOS). According to blockchain security company PeckShield cited by The Block, smaller portions of the funds were also sent to CoinSwitch, BW, Binance and HitBTC.\nThe head of business development at Exmo, Maria Stankevich, confirmed to Cointelegraph that 662,600 EOS (around 22% of the total stolen sum) ended up on its servers.\n\u201cDue to really hard work of the whole team and sleepless night we managed to block almost all the funds.\u201d\nNow, Exmo is waiting for Bithumb to send an official inquiry to its British address so that the exchange can transfer the stolen assets back in accordance with the local law and GDPR-compliance processes. \u201cWe are in touch with Bithumb, they are doing all the necessary legal procedures right now,\u201d Stankevich told Cointelegraph.\nHuobi, which reportedly received 263,605 EOS (around 8.7%) of the stolen funds, also verified to Cointelegraph that its security team detected and subsequently froze the assets related to \u201cthe blacklisted account(s).\u201d\nChangeNow has published a blog post confirming that \u201cpart of the funds worth more than half a million USD worth of EOS and XRP\u201d were sent to its wallets. Soon after receiving a message from Bithumb about the ongoing hack, ChangeNow temporarily disabled EOS and XRP deposits, and blacklisted all the malicious addresses received from Bithumb. Pauline Shangett, the marketing and PR manager at ChangeNow, told Cointelegraph:\n\u201cWe have been contacted by Bithumb representatives with regards to getting the funds returned to them, and their case is being processed in close collaboration with them and the Korean police. To our knowledge, the investigation is still ongoing.\u201d\nChangelly\u2019s chief security officer, Sophia Lee, informed Cointelegraph that, as per its recent blog entry, $480,000 in EOS and $76,000 in XRP funds have been frozen until further investigation:\n\u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019re not in the capacity to make any comments about our communication with the Korean police at a time. Currently, we\u2019re finalizing the report with data about transactions, so there is no public statement just yet.\u201d\nKuCoin and CoinSwitch have also confirmed to Cointelegraph that they detected some of the embezzled assets funds in their wallets. Jing Cheung of KuCoin wrote via email:\n\u201cWe have frozen the suspicious accounts per Bithumb's and Korean police's requests. We are now waiting for the instructions from Korean police regarding how could we return these digital assets.\u201d\nThe CoinSwitch team told Cointelegraph that, although they run a noncustodial service that holds user funds only during the time of exchange, they were able to freeze some of the assets associated with the hack.\nCointelegraph has also reached out to Binance for further comment, but they declined to comment.\nThe account that was used to steal EOS from Bithumb is still live, according to data obtained from Eosq. Although the majority of the embezzled assets have been transferred to other addresses, some people seem to be sending dust transactions to the account in order to ask for the money via the comment section.\nIt is still unclear whether or not it was an insider job", "birthday": "2019-04-18T21:10:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-18 20:10:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 18}

A multitude of platforms are often used to bring concerts and conferences to life, causing unnecessary delays and sometimes resulting in costly mistakes. In addition, the startup says the industry is riddled with middlemen who often charge large fees but \u201cdo not add value to the process\u201d \u2014 occasionally resulting in \u201cfraud and significant losses.\u201d\nIn its white paper, the company illustrates the real-world consequences that fragmentation in this industry can bring. Ticket prices can soar because of secondary black markets, inefficient systems can mean that tickets are duplicated, payments to top talent can be delayed, and organizers can face an uphill struggle as they look for new venues and sponsors.\nThree core values\nEvedo says that it prides itself on its three core values of \u201ctrust, creativity and empathy,\u201d and believes that its infrastructure can help those working behind the scenes on major events achieve creative and exciting results, all while reducing the amount of time and effort they spend on realizing their vision.\nIts business-to-business (b2b) marketplace aims to connect organizers with the contractors and sponsors who can get their event off the ground \u2014 empowering them with the ability to easily compare fees and reputations so they find the perfect partner. Agreements would be bound by smart contracts, paving the way for automated payments whenever key milestones are reached.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nThe recovery in crypto prices has led to an increase in over-the-counter (OTC) demand for Bitcoin and altcoins. This surge in volume was cited by Binance\u2019s CFO as one of the reasons for its strong Q1 performance.\nAnother platform being watched closely is the yet-to-be-launched Bakkt. Anonymous sources told Bloomberg that the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is reluctant to approve the Bitcoin futures because Bakkt intends to hold user assets. However, as the CFTC recognizes state bank and trust licenses, Bakkt might seek a New York BitLicense to launch its bitcoin futures. This is likely to increase the possibility of a green signal by the CFTC for the project.\nThe crypto and blockchain space is attracting investment from both venture capitalists and the government. Compared to the $2.5 billion in investments by venture capital firms in 2018, the space has already seen investors pump in $850 million in 2019. At this pace, this year\u2019s total investment is likely to top that of last year. Similarly, the U.S. federal government\u2019s blockchain spending is expected to increase from $10.7 million in 2017 to $123.5 million by 2022.\nWe also like the way the community has been quick to respond to the Notre Dame tragedy.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) has continued to move up at a snail\u2019s pace. This shows that the bulls are nervous to buy aggressively at higher levels. But if the digital currency rises above $5404.82, it might attract some buying and short covering. The target levels to watch on the upside are $5,674.84 and above it to $5,900.\n\nThe uptrending moving averages and the RSI close to the overbought zone suggests that the bulls are at an advantage. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the BTC/USD pair turns down from the current levels and plunges below $4,914.11. Such a move will signal profit booking and short initiation by the aggressive bears. The traders can trail the stop loss on the remaining long positions to $4,800.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) has once again broken out of the overhead resistance of $167.32. It is now likely to attempt to scale $187.98. If successful, it will indicate strength and the bulls can propel the digital currency to $220. Though the target objective of a breakout of the ascending triangle is $251.64, it has a slew of resistance between $220 and $251.64.\n\nBoth the moving averages are gradually trending up and the RSI is in the positive zone. This suggests that the bulls have the upper hand.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the ETH/USD pair back below $167.32. A breakdown of $156.42 will turn the trend in favor of the bears. Traders can continue to hold the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $150. We shall trail the stops higher in a couple of days.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) broke out of $0.33108 on April 17 but could not sustain it. The price is again back below $0.33108. This shows a lack of buyers at higher levels. Both the moving averages are flat and the RSI is close to 50. This points to range-bound action for the next few days. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn our previous analysis, we had recommended buying if the XRP/USD pair sustained $0.33108 for the next two days. But with the price falling below $0.33108 again today, our buy condition has not triggered. Considering the repeated failed breakouts, we have withdrawn our buy proposal. We swill suggest a trade when the pair decisively sustains above $0.33108.\nCurrently, if the bears sink the digital currency below the 50-day SMA, it will signal weakness and a drop to $0.27795 is possible.\nBCH/USD\nAfter failing to sustain above the overhead resistance of $332.58, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is facing some profit booking. It can now dip to the 20-day EMA, which is likely to offer support. Both the moving averages are sloping up, which shows that the bulls have the upper hand. If the rebound from the 20-day EMA fails to breakout of the overhead resistance zone of $332.58\u2013$363.30, it will remain range bound for a few days.\n\nA break below the 20-day EMA can sink the BCH/USD pair to $239, which is a critical support. If this support gives way, it will indicate that the bears are back in action.\nOn the other hand, if the bulls succeed in breaking out of $363.30, the pair can rally to $451.32. The digital currency has a history of vertical rallies, hence, a breakout of $451.32 can surprise on the upside. We will wait for the uptrend to resume before proposing a trade.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) has held the 20-day EMA for the past few days. This shows that the bulls are keen to defend this support. The 20-day EMA is sloping up gradually and the RSI is just above the midpoint. This suggests a marginal advantage to the bulls. If the price scales above $84.3439, we expect a quick move to the overhead resistance zone of $91\u2013$100.\n\nA breakout of the resistance zone will complete a rounding bottom pattern that has a target objective of $159 and above it $180. Traders can buy a small portion \u2014 about 30% \u2014 of their usual position size on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $84.3439. The rest of the position can be purchased above $100 with initial stop loss at $74.\nContrary to our expectation, if the LTC/USD pair turns around from any of the overhead resistances and plunges below $74, it can correct to the 50-day SMA and below it to $62.450.\nEOS/USD\nEOS has been consolidating above the 20-day EMA for the past few days. The bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 20-day EMA and the bears have not allowed a strong rebound from the support. This equilibrium phase is unlikely to continue for long.\n\nThe upsloping moving averages and the RSI in positive territory suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. A breakout of $5.6602 will indicate strength and can carry the price to $6.0726 and above it to $6.8299.\nOn the contrary, if the EOS/USD pair turns down and dives below $5, it can decline to the $4.4930\u2013$3.8723 support zone. We do not spot any reliable buy setups at current levels; hence, we remain neutral on the pair.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) surged on April 18 and has followed up with another strong move today. This shows that the bulls are keen to buy at higher levels. It is now likely to retest the lifetime high at $26.4732350. With both the moving averages sloping up and the RSI in overbought territory, the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nIf the BNB/USD pair rises to a new lifetime high, it will be a major positive. It will indicate that the price reached during January 2018 is not a misnomer. This will encourage the traders to keep buying the other digital currencies that are fundamentally sound.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the pair reverses direction from the current level and plummets below the moving averages. Until then, it remains on target to make a new lifetime high. We do not spot an entry with a good risk to reward ratio, hence, we have not suggested a trade in it.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) has largely been trading between $0.110 and $0.120 for the past seven days. The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is close to 50. This also supports the current consolidation.\n\nIf the XLM/USD pair breaks out and sustains above $0.120, it can move up to the downtrend line. We shall turn positive on the pair after it sustains above $0.14861760.\nConversely, if the digital currency plummets below $0.110, it can drop to the uptrend line, below which it will turn negative.\nADA/USD\nAfter failing to breakout of the downtrend line, Cardano (ADA) has broken down of the 20-day EMA. This is a negative sign. If the bears can sink the price below $0.075920, it can decline to the 50-day SMA.\n", "birthday": "2019-04-19T20:06:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-19 19:06:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 19}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nBitcoin\u2019s dominance has increased from just below 50% in early-April to 52.3%. This suggests that the focus is back on Bitcoin after the initial rally by the altcoins from the lows. As long as the leader stays strong, the recovery is on track.\nWhile Bakkt is more institution oriented, LedgerX the United States-regulated crypto derivatives and clearing platform is planning to launch physically-settled Bitcoin futures contract targeting retail investors. LedgerX believes that as Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization is only equal to that of a large stock, huge institutional involvement is unlikely, hence, they are focusing on the retail crowd.\nCorporate Traveller, the largest travel management firm in the United Kingdom, has heeded requests from clients and started to accept Bitcoin payments.\nThe recovery in cryptocurrencies has helped Binance\u2019s profits soar by 66% in Q1 2019, compared to the previous quarter. This indicates that traders are quick to return to crypto markets on the first sign of a revival. If the recovery continues, it is likely to attract the traders still waiting for confirmation of a bottom.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) again bounced off the support at $4,914.11 on April 15. This is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are keen to buy on dips closer to support. Both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. This shows that the bulls are in command. The price will now try to climb above $5,404.82.\nIf successful, the digital currency will move up to $5,674.84 and above it to $5,900. We expect the $5,900 level to bring in a lot of supply, making it difficult for the bulls to scale it on the first attempt.\n\nContrary to our assumption, if the bulls fail to push the BTC/USD pair above $5,404.82, it can remain range bound for a few days between $4,871.16 to $5,404.82.\nThe momentum will weaken if the bears sink the price below $4871.16. Such a move can result in a fall to the 50-day SMA. Hence, the traders can protect their remaining long positions with a stop loss at $4,700.\nETH/USD\nAfter failing to breakout and sustain above $167.32 for four consecutive days, Ethereum (ETH) fell below the 20-day EMA on April 15. However, the bears could not capitalize on this move as the digital currency bounced back the next day itself. This shows buying at lower levels.\n\nThe bulls should now quickly push the price above $167.32, else we might see another down leg. If the ETH/USD pair sustains above the overhead resistance, it can move up to $187.98. We expect the pair to pick up momentum after breaking out of it. The pattern target for a breakout of the ascending triangle is $251.64.\nOn the downside, the support lies at $156.42, below which a drop to the 50-day SMA is probable. Both the moving averages are gradually sloping up, which suggests a minor advantage to the bulls. Therefore, we suggest traders retain the stops on the remaining long positions at $150. We expect a decisive move within the next 3\u20134 days.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) plummeted below the 50-day SMA on April 15 but the lower levels saw buying, which pushed the price back up on the next day. This is a positive sign as it indicates that the bulls are keen to defend the 50-day SMA.\n\nThe bulls will now try to carry the XRP/USD pair back above the overhead resistance. If successful, a move to $0.37835 should be in the cards. We shall suggest entering long positions if the pair sustains above $0.33108 for the next two days. The stop loss for this trade can be kept at $0.30.\nOn the upside, if the bulls can ascend above $0.37835, the digital currency can start a new uptrend and rally to $0.55. Though $0.40 and $0.45 might act as resistances, we expect these levels to be crossed.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency turns down and sustains below the 50-day SMA. In such a case, a drop to $0.27795 is possible.\nBCH/USD\nThe rally in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) on April 15 hit a wall at $335.62. The bulls have not been able to scale this level since then. However, the digital currency has not given up ground either, which indicates that the buyers are still not booking profits. If the price stays close to $332.58, it increases the probability of a breakout to the upside. With both the moving averages sloping up and the RSI close to the overbought zone, the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nNevertheless, if the BCH/USD pair fails to break out of the overhead resistance, it might remain range bound between $272.41 and $332.58 for a few days. The pair will turn negative on a breakdown of the support at $272.41. We might wait for the price to scale $363.30 before recommending a trade in it.\nEOS/USD\nEOS has been sustaining above the 20-day EMA, which is a positive sign. Both the moving averages are moving up and the RSI is in the positive territory. This suggests that the bulls are in command.\n\nIf the EOS/USD pair breaks out of $5.6602, it can move up to $6.0726. The resistance line is close to this level and is likely to act as a roadblock. But if the bulls ascend the resistance line a move to the critical overhead resistance of $6.8299 is possible.\nContrary to our expectation, if the pair reverses direction and plummets below $5, it can drop to the $4.4930\u2013$3.8723 support zone. We expect the buyers to step in this zone and provide support. As we do not find any reliable buy setup at current levels, we remain neutral on the digital currency.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) has been struggling to bounce off the 20-day EMA. This shows a lack of buyers at higher levels. The bears will now try to sink the price below the 20-day EMA and $74. If successful, the correction can extend to the 50-day SMA. We anticipate a strong support closer to $62. Any breach of this support will turn the trend bearish.\n\nCurrently, the 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is just above 50. This points to the probability of a range formation in the short term. Our view will prove to be wrong if the LTC/USD pair rebounds strongly from current levels and rises above the overhead resistance of $91 to $100. Such a move can result in a rally to $159 and above it to $180.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) continues to trade strong. It has maintained above the 20-day EMA for the past four days, which is a bullish sign. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in positive territory. This indicates that the bulls are in command.\n\nOn a breakout above $22.1026895, a retest of the lifetime high at $26.4732350 is probable. If the bulls succeed in making a new lifetime high, it will be a huge sentiment booster.\nHowever, if the price turns down from the current levels or from the overhead resistance it can drop to the 20-day EMA. If this support gives way, the next stop is the 50-day SMA. The negative divergence on the RSI is the only bearish factor that projects the possibility of a correction. Until the price remains above the 50-day EMA, we remain bullish on the BNB/USD pair. If this support breaks down, we can expect a deeper correction. We do not find any reliable buy setups at the current levels; hence, we are not proposing a trade in it.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) is largely stuck between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA for the past five days. The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI is close to the center. This increases the probability of a consolidation in the short term.\n\nIf the XLM/USD pair plummets below the 50-day SMA, it can drop to the uptrend line. A breakdown of this support will turn the tide in favor of the bears.\nConversely, a breakout above the 20-day EMA can carry the price to the downtrend line and above it to $0.14861760. We anticipate the start of a new uptrend if the bulls can sustain above $0.14861760. For now, we remain neutral on the digital currency.\nADA/USD\nCardano (ADA) has been struggling to bounce off the 20-day EMA. The price keeps correcting to the moving average, which shows a lack of demand at higher levels. After the price action of the past few days, the 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is also dropping to the midpoint. This suggests a range formation in the short term.\n", "birthday": "2019-04-17T20:19:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-17 19:19:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 17}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nThe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have launched a private blockchain and quasi-cryptocurrency to bridge the gap between its employees and the blockchain technology. The cryptocurrency will be called \u201cLearning Coin\u201d and will have no monetary value, but the staff will earn these coins after reaching certain educational milestones. The developers are yet to decide on how these earned coins can be redeemed by the staff. This is a major step as it shows that international agencies are making efforts to understand the technology seriously.\nIn a recent Twitter poll, IMF asked: \u201cHow do you think you will be paying for lunch in 5 years?\u201d 56% of the respondents said that they would be paying in cryptocurrencies, well ahead of the 27% by mobile phone. Bank cards and cash were way behind at 9% and 8% respectively. To some extent, this projects the prevailing mood in the masses against cash and bank cards.\nFidelity Digital Assets has appointed Christine Sandler \u2014 former head of institutional sales at Coinbase \u2014 as head of Sales and Marketing. While the groundwork is being laid out to facilitate the entry of institutions into the crypto space, we are yet to see their presence in a big way.\nAfter the rally from the lows, most cryptocurrencies have cooled off. Will the bears now sink the price back to the lows, or will the major cryptocurrencies form a higher low and indicate a bottom? Let\u2019s find out by analyzing the charts.\nBTC/USD\nInstitutional players are buying Bitcoin (BTC). Their purchase volume, the percentage of the total volume has reached 19% in April. This indicates that the large players expect the bear market to end in the near future. With a rise in prices, the Chinese traders have returned to action. However, due to the cryptocurrency ban in China, they are paying a premium to the over-the-counter services to take a position in Bitcoin. This shows that even in a place where Bitcoin trading is banned, traders are looking at ways to buy it, well above the prevailing prices.\nThe rise from the lows has pushed Bitcoin to the most overbought levels since the bull run, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone. On the other hand, the \u201cBitcoin Misery Index,\u201d created by Fundstrat Global Advisors Thomas Lee, has reached its highest level since 2016. This can either be a good sign or a bad sign, according to Lee. But what does our analysis project? Let\u2019s see.\n\nThe BTC/USD pair picked up momentum after it broke out of $4,255, quickly climbing above $5,000 and reaching a high of $5,404.82. With this rise, the 20-week EMA has started to turn up and the RSI has inched into the positive territory. This shows that the bulls are asserting their supremacy in the short-term.\nOn the upside, $5,900 remains a major roadblock. The 50-week SMA is also located just below this level. Hence, we anticipate a stiff resistance between $5,600 to $5,900.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency turns down from the current levels and slips below $4,255. Such a move will dent sentiment and indicate that the bears are still shorting at higher levels. The next few weeks are critical as it will confirm whether the bottom is in place or not.\nEOS/USD\nFinLab EOS VC fund, a joint venture of FinLab AG and Block.one, has invested $5 million in Moonlighting, a freelancing website with over 700,000 users. The website will now migrate its users to the EOS blockchain. Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Ethereum (ETH) and IOHK, also lashed out this week at EOS and Ethereum for their approach to development.\n\nThe EOS/USD pair is currently facing resistance at the 50-week SMA. The resistance line is also located close by: a breakout of this can carry the pair to $6.8299. If the bulls ascend above $6.8299, the next target to watch on the upside is $9.3483.\nThe 20-week EMA is gradually sloping up and the RSI has jumped into the positive zone. This shows that the bulls have the upper hand. On the downside, strong support is at $4.4930 and below it at $3.8723. The 20-week EMA is also close to this level. Hence, we expect the bulls to defend this zone aggressively.\nHowever, contrary to our assumption, if the digital currency turns down from the current levels and plummets below the $4.4930-$3.8723 support zone, it will indicate weakness.\nETH/USD\nThough Ethereum (ETH) has been losing out to Tron in DApp growth, it continues to be the first choice of developers to build their DApp on, according to a report by DApp analytics website DApp.com. Along with this, the Ethereum network is the sought after option to raise funds through ICOs, according to a report by rating site ICObench. In another report released by the European Union Blockchain Observatory and Forum, the Ethereum blockchain was identified as the most preferred platform for the creation of tokens. Will Ethereum play catch up with the other altcoins or will it continue to underperform?\n\nThe ETH/USD pair completed an ascending triangle pattern when it closed (UTC time frame) above the overhead resistance of $167.32. The pattern target following this breakout is $251.64. However, the pair quickly turned around and has again declined below the support at $167.32, which is a bearish sign. If a bullish pattern fails, it denotes weakness. The 20-week EMA has flattened out and the RSI is close to the 50 level. This suggests a consolidation in the near term. But if the digital currency reverses direction from the 20-week EMA and sustains above $167.32, it will indicate demand at lower levels. Above $167.32, the rally can reach $251.64 and above it to the 50-week SMA.\nTRX/USD\nTron (TRX) blockchain has the fastest growing DApp user base with over 300,000 active users. A Tron-based version of stablecoin Tether (USDT) is about to be launched, which is being viewed as a major win for the network. Though Ethereum is a competitor, Tron founder and CEO Justin Sun believes that Tron will \u201cofficially collaborate\u201d with Ethereum as soon as this year.\nThe testnet of the Sun Network expansion plan is expected to launch in end-May. This will increase the overall capacity of the network, reduce energy consumption and improve security. With a host of fundamental news backing it, can the price start a new uptrend? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe TRX/USD pair has been trading in a tight range of $0.01830 to $0.02815521 for the past few months. Though it has broken out of the range twice, it has not been able to sustain the higher levels and has re-entered the range within a week. This shows a lack of demand at higher levels.\nIf the pair turns around after taking support at the 20-week EMA, it might again try to sustain above $0.02815521. A breakout above $0.03575668 will confirm a bottom and the start of a new uptrend.\nConversely, if the pair slips below the 20-week EMA, it can remain range bound for a few more weeks. We might get a clear picture in the next couple of weeks.\nETC/USD\nCircle-owned exchange Poloniex enabled margin trading on Ethereum Classic (ETC) \u00a0for non-U.S. customers with a total leverage of 2.5 times. As with all the other coins that are available for margin trading, owners can lend their ETC and earn interest on it. The improving sentiment across the sector rubbed on to the digital currency as it skyrocketed higher on April 7. Let\u2019s analyze its future prospects.\n\nThe ETC/USD pair traded in a tight range for 11 weeks before breaking out of the overhead resistance at $5.889. We had expected the price to reach $9.50 levels after breaking out of the resistance, but the pair turned around from $8.084.\nCurrently, the digital currency is retesting the breakout levels of $5.889. If it rebounds from this level, it will again attempt to rise to $9.50. On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below $5.889, it can correct towards the lows.\nThe 20-week EMA has flattened out and the RSI is close to the midpoint. This points to a consolidation in the near term.\nMHC/USD*\nMetaHash (MHC) aims to bring an ecosystem to the users that is fast, completely decentralized, secure, economical to use and easy to operate, according to the firm. Its mainnet was launched on June 29 of last year, and it has a transaction speed of about 3 seconds and a declared capacity of 50,000 transactions per second. MetaGate is its official browser software, which has a multi-currency wallet and a DApps store; among the notable DApps launched are a blockchain-based encrypted messenger and a voting application.\nThe idea behind MetaHash is to enable businesses and systems to easily use blockchain for various applications, the website states.

Since China formally banned crypto trading in the country in 2017, investors have had to resort to creative methods in order to deal in Bitcoin.

Bloomberg writes that similar buy patterns in the past have resulted in multi-week downturns, citing McGlone as referring to Bitcoin as a bubble. McGlone states that the recent market growth came about due to a long-term price compression and low volatility, causing the price to be \u201creleased from the cage.\u201d Bloomberg also cites David Tawil, president of crypto hedge fund ProChain Capital, who reportedly expects the market to continue its downward trend.\n\nCoinbase Crypto Exchange Debuts Visa Card for U.K. Customers\nMajor United States cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has launched Coinbase Card, which will enable its United Kingdom-based customers to pay both in-store and online with cryptocurrency.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/young-africa-looks-to-crypto-for-payment", "title": " Young Africa Looks to Crypto for Payment ", "content": "Data from Google Trends shows that Lagos, Nigeria ranks as the number one city based on the volume of online searches for Bitcoin (BTC). While this data may indicate a high level of interest among the city's approximately 21 million people, it has yet to equate to tangible adoption of the emerging trend of technology.\nBut that is changing, as a growing movement among young people frustrated with existing payment systems looks for alternatives.\nBitcoin as a dollar substitute\nFor the most part, \u201cLagosians\u201d who are aware of the existence of Bitcoin see the top-ranked cryptocurrency as a substitute for the United States dollar. BTC exists for them on a spectrum that lends itself as a viable substitute for foreign currency.\nPayment companies like PayPal do not allow Nigerians to receive money transfers from abroad, thanks to the notoriety of internet fraudsters in the country \u2014 and the companies that offer such services usually charge high fees.\nThus, it is common to see the city's growing freelancing community beginning to pivot toward cryptocurrency payments. Many of the youth in the city, having battled with underemployment or unemployment, have sought to try their hands outside the traditional working environment.\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reports that Nigeria's unemployment rate rose to above 23 percent in 2018. In a city like Lagos, many young university graduates can be seen making a living as freelancers, offering services from copywriting to website design and even computer programming.\n\nGiven that many of their clients are based abroad, there can be issues with receiving payment for the work done. However, with a BTC wallet and a plethora of local exchange services, these freelancers can receive payments easily from clients spread across the globe.\nApart from freelancers, business owners are also using Bitcoin, as well as other crypto-focused platforms, as substitutes for foreign currency and banks. Companies like BitPesa offer easy access to liquidity, which can be a hassle to businesses in frontier markets like Lagos, especially in the context of foreign trade.\nIn a private message to Cointelegraph, Victor Alagbe, the Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Blockchain Strategist at OneWattSolar, an energy startup looking to leverage blockchain technology in boosting renewable energy adoption across Africa, said:\n\u201cI see crypto taking up a strong position in the remittances space. It\u2019s often cheaper, less stressful (in terms of documentation) and faster to send and receive crypto. Many younger folks in the diaspora are now leveraging crypto to send money back home. Some techies working remotely are also getting paid in crypto.\u201d\nIn 2001, the government at the time introduced mobile telecommunications technology to the country. In the 18 years since that landmark event, mobile telecoms have become a significant sector in the nation's economy, contributing 10.5 percent of its gross domestic product as of mid-2018.\nNigeria has over 100 million active internet subscriptions, mostly on mobile platforms. Bitcoin as a payment technology leverages on this access to the web, allowing tech-savvy Nigerians to participate in the growing cryptocurrency trend.\nBitcoin underutilization\nWhile the peer-to-peer (p2p) trading aspect of the emerging BTC narrative continues to take shape in Lagos, there is a massive underutilization of the technology itself. Even with the potentially paradigm-shifting aura attached to cryptocurrency, Lagos \u2014 and, by extension, Nigerians \u2014 seem content to focus only on BTC as a dollar substitute without diving deeper into the technological ramifications of broader Bitcoin adoption.\nData from Bitnodes, which tracks the global Bitcoin nodes distribution, shows that there are virtually no nodes in the country. Yes, Lagos leads the way in online BTC searches. But only a handful of people run actual Bitcoin nodes.\nThis reticence for a broad-based adoption isn't entirely down to apathy toward the technology itself, but is, instead, a representation of the lack of proper infrastructure on which to support a vibrant digital economy. In a city that lacks constant electricity supply, the fact that people aren't running Bitcoin nodes hardly comes as a surprise.\nConcerning Bitcoin underutilization, Alagbe opined:\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a whole of lot education that needs to go into helping people understand the relationships between Bitcoin (crypto) and its underlying Blockchain technology. However, the Nigerian market is likely to focus on crypto to the exclusion of other applications of Blockchain inasmuch for as long as there\u2019s profit to be made in the speculative side of cryptocurrency.\u201d\nAnother startling indicator of Bitcoin underutilization in the city comes from the lack of retail acceptance of the cryptocurrency. While metropolitan areas in the United States, Europe and parts of Asia have increasingly seen more retail adoption of BTC as a payment means, Lagos rarely registers on the map, as indicated by Coinmap.\nThe OneWattSolar COO highlights this same trend, declaring:\n\u201cIn my opinion, Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) is still seen as a speculative play to make quick gains. You can see people trading huge sums of Bitcoin on platforms such as Remitano but you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a business that accepts crypto as payment for products or services.\u201d\nAt the time of writing this article, Coinmap reports that there are more than 14,600 venues that accept Bitcoin payments across the globe. Only South Africa registers any significant BTC adoption in the retail scene as far as Africa is concerned.\nOnce again, Nigeria risks falling behind the rest of the world in the race to embrace the emerging digital landscape. While other megacities obtain first-mover advantages in being at the forefront of the emerging digital revolution, either by ignorance or the absence of requisite basic infrastructure, Lagos continues only to associate with the basic aspects of BTC adoption.\nBitcoin and the allure of get-rich-quick schemes\nOver the last decade-and-a-half, Nigeria has gained notoriety for being home to internet fraud. While this image continues to be inimical to the aspirations of honest and hardworking Nigerians, it has also contributed to many people casting a jaundiced glance in the direction of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.\nThis situation hasn't been aided by the fact that BTC began to come into public consciousness after the debacle of the Russian Mavrodi Mondial Moneybox (MMM) scam. For the most part of 2016 and 2017, many characterized BTC as the \"new MMM.\"\nIn a private chat with Cointelegraph, Joseph Samuel, a blockchain analyst, web designer, and team leader at \u201cHumane Love,\u201d a Lagos-based charity project on the EOS blockchain spoke about how some Lagosians tend to conflate and confuse Bitcoin and MMM, saying:\n\u201cMany Nigerians got to know about Bitcoin during the MMM Ponzi scam. As a result, they tend to see Bitcoin as another fraudulent investment scheme. However, with proper education, this misinformation can become a thing of the past.\u201d\nIn so doing, they missed out on the massive profits gained by early adopters during the late 2017 bull rally. With BTC almost eclipsing the $20,000 mark in late 2017, having begun the year trading below $1,000, the usual opportunists came out of hiding to evince designs of fraudulent schemes centered around Bitcoin.\nFor Samuel, the city still has time to catch up to the rest of the world, declaring:\n\u201cLagos is a mega city filled with some of the smartest people in the world. Unfortunately, the fear of the unknown prevents many from adopting newer technological breakthroughs. Once they become more amenable to change and realize what Bitcoin represents, Lagos will become a major hub in the developing digital economy.\u201d\nOrganizations like the Cryptography Development Initiative of Nigeria (CDIN) and the Nigerian Blockchain Alliance (NBA) have been at the forefront of combating cryptocurrency scams in Lagos and other parts of the country. Together, these institutions collaborate with agencies like the Nigeria Electronic Fraud Forum (NeFF) to prevent the proliferation of Bitcoin-related criminal activity.\nBitcoin and the 2016 recession\nHistorical charts from Coin Dance shows a massive increase from 2016 in Bitcoin trading volume on Localbitcoins \u2014 a p2p BTC trading platform. This marked increase was no coincidence, as 2016 saw the country's economy go into its worst recession since 1987.\nAround that time, many local digital payment companies in the city also began to pivot to Bitcoin. New businesses also sprang up, offering avenues to purchase the cryptocurrency. Cointelegraph spoke with Adekemi Bitire, a marketing executive at IBIC Exchange, an over-the-counter (OTC) Bitcoin exchange in the Yaba area of Lagos, about the BTC adoption trend in the city. Bitire explained:\n\"Over the course of my involvement in the Bitcoin OTC scene here in Lagos, I have observed an exponential increase in the number of people adopting BTC trading. More people are getting into the business, earning steady commissions, and improving their standard of living.\"\nBitire elaborated on the expanding demographic of BTC adoption in the city:\n\"Apart from university students and out-of-college freelancers, we are also seeing mid-level employees of companies in the city using Bitcoin as a way of creating another revenue stream to augment their monthly salaries.\"\nBitcoin as an avenue of escaping weaponized poverty\nThe present-day reality in Nigeria is one many believe is firmly entrenched in the weaponization of ignorance and poverty for the sole purpose of disenfranchising the majority. The ruling oligarchy, while enjoying the commonwealth of the people, propagates a message of \"living within one's means,\" a euphemism, some say, for the glorification of poverty that simultaneously casts aspersions on the desire to achieve economic and financial emancipation.\nWithin that alleged construct of this tyrannical state-sponsored weaponization of poverty lies a veritable tipping point for greater Bitcoin adoption in Lagos and other places in Nigeria. The core principle of BTC lies in libertarian ideals that are at odds with the socialist politics of mass economic disenfranchisement.", "birthday": "2019-04-14T01:12:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-14 00:12:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 14}

The questions below address implications within the United States, but similar issues arise around the world. As always, check with a local tax professional to assess your own particular tax situation.\n1. Do I need to report my cryptocurrency trades to the IRS?\nYou need to report your cryptocurrency activity if you incurred a taxable event during the year. A taxable event is a specific scenario that triggers a tax liability. The below are a list of the taxable events as specified by the IRS 2014 guidance:\nTrading cryptocurrency to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar is a taxable event.Trading cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency is a taxable event (you have to calculate the fair market value in USD at the time of the trade).Using cryptocurrency for goods and services is a taxable event (again, you have to calculate the fair market value in USD at the time of the trade; you may also end up owing sales tax).\nThe most common tax event from the above is trading one cryptocurrency for another \u2014 for example, trading your Bitcoin (BTC) for Ethereum (ETH).\nOn the other hand, there are other actions that cryptocurrency enthusiasts also commonly take that are not taxable events and do not trigger a tax reporting requirement. Listed below are scenarios in which traders do not trigger a tax event:\nGiving cryptocurrency as a gift is not a taxable event (the recipient inherits the cost basis; the gift tax still applies, if you exceed the gift tax exemption amount).A wallet-to-wallet transfer is not a taxable event (you can transfer between exchanges or wallets without realizing capital gains and losses, so make sure to check your records against the records of your exchanges, because they may count transfers as taxable events, like they are a safe harbor).Buying cryptocurrency with USD is not a taxable event. You don\u2019t realize gains until you trade, use or sell your crypto. If you hold longer than a year, you can realize long-term capital gains (which are about half the rate of short-term). If you hold less than a year, you realize short-term capital gains and losses.\nAn example\nLet\u2019s say you buy 2 BTC from Coinbase. You just hold this crypto for the year. In this case, you have no reporting requirement, as you have not triggered a taxable event. Even if you send this to an offline wallet, you still do not need to report this, as merely sending crypto from one place to another is not a taxable event.\nNow let\u2019s say you send this 2 BTC to Binance and start trading it for other altcoins. Now you have incurred a taxable event (trading one cryptocurrency for another) and you will need to report this transaction on your taxes and file it with your 2018 tax return, even if you lost money on the trade.\nKeep in mind that mining cryptocurrency is also taxable and is treated as income.\n2. How do I file my crypto taxes?\nIf you are simply buying, selling and trading cryptocurrencies you will report these trades on the IRS Form 8949, as pictured below.\n\nAs seen in the above example, you have sold 0.5 Bitcoin. You acquired the Bitcoin on July 16, 2017, and you sold it on December 17, 2017. You sold the Bitcoin for a total proceed of $9,848.00, and your cost basis was $970.00. This led to your gain of $8,873.00 (reported in column h).\nYou will report each crypto-to-crypto trade and each taxable event from the calendar year on this form.\nYou can use crypto tax software to automatically build this report for you, if you don\u2019t have your own records of the historical prices, dates and fair market values of your trades.\nOnce you have your net gain or loss calculated from Form 8949, the total will simply flow into your 1040 Schedule D. You should include these forms with your entire tax return upon filing.\nForeign account holdings\nIf you traded on foreign exchanges like Binance, you may additionally need to report these holdings. You do not pay any tax on these holdings, but it is important that you file the following reports if either situation applies to you.\nFBAR: A taxpayer with a financial interest in or signatory authority over a foreign financial account must file a Foreign Bank Account Report (FBAR) FinCEN Form 114 if the aggregate value of the foreign financial account exceeds $10,000 at any time during the calendar year. Noncompliance with FBAR would subject a taxpayer to steep civil and criminal penalties. Each nonwillful failure-to-file violation can carry a civil penalty of $10,000. Penalties for each willful violation could be the greater of $100,000 or 50% of the amount in the account.\nFATCA: A taxpayer with foreign financial assets of $50,000 or more must report it under Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requirements on Form 8938. It is recommended that cryptocurrency-invested hedge fund accounts and cryptocurrency-denominated exchange accounts be reported in the summary information in Part I of Form 8938. Specific information should be given in Part V. Noncompliance with FATCA could subject a taxpayer to taxes, severe penalties in excess of the unreported foreign assets, and exclusion from access to U.S. markets, which could include a regulated cryptocurrency derivatives clearing market.\n3. What will happen if I don\u2019t report my crypto activity?\nThe reality is that no one knows for sure. However, it is not advised.\nThe IRS publicly stated on July 2, 2018 that one of their core campaigns and focuses for the year is the taxation of virtual currencies. Unfortunately, lack of reporting will be treated as tax fraud.\n4. Can I reduce my tax bill by filing my crypto capital losses?\nYes.\nWhen you realize a capital gain \u2014 if you sold your crypto for more than you purchased it for \u2014 you owe a tax on the dollar amount of the gain. However, when you sell (or trade) your crypto for less than you purchased it for, you incur a capital loss, and you can use this loss to offset gains from other trades or even a gain from the sale of other property \u2014 like stocks in your portfolio. \u00a0\nWhenever your total capital gains and losses for the year add up to a negative number, you incur a net capital loss. If the net capital loss is less than or equal to $3,000 ($1,500 if you are married and filing a separate tax return), then that entire capital loss can be used to offset other types of income \u2014 like the income from your job.\nIf your losses exceed $3,000, then the amount over $3,000 will be rolled forward to the next tax year.", "birthday": "2019-04-15T13:44:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-15 12:44:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 15}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nThe research arm of Binance believes that cryptocurrency markets have bottomed out, after studying data from 2014\u20132019. They also found that the total institutional holding in the crypto market was about 7% of total supply.\nEndowments are making the most of the bear market in cryptocurrencies. In 2018, 94% of endowments allocated money to crypto related investments. Another positive is that they expect to retain and increase their investments in the future.\nOn the derivatives front, data from CME shows that institutional involvement in Bitcoin futures has decreased this past week. As of April 9, the total long positions held by institutional investors and asset managers declined by 11% and short positions by 30% over the previous week. Overall, the total number of open short positions were 4,177 and the open long positions were 3,267. The total short positions have increased between April 2 and 9, which shows that the aggressive bears are entering short positions at higher levels.\nCo-founder and CEO of BitMEX Arthur Hayes wants to launch a cryptocurrency options platform to give the traders more tools to play with. \u00a0\u00a0\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) has bounced off the support at $4,914.11 but lacks momentum. It has been grinding up for the past two days, which shows a lack of urgency among the bulls to push prices higher. However, both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. This shows that the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nIf the slow northward march continues, the level to keep in mind is $5,404.82. If this level is scaled, the BTC/USD pair can rise to $5,900.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels and plunges below the 20-day EMA. This will attract profit booking by the longs and initiation of short positions by the bears. Below the 20-day EMA, the fall can extend to the 50-day SMA. Therefore, traders can raise the stop loss on the remaining long positions to $4,700. Let\u2019s play it safe.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) is once again trying to break out of the overhead resistance at $167.32. If successful, it will complete the ascending triangle pattern, which has a target objective of $251.64 and higher. The rise might face a minor resistance at $187.98 but if the bulls clear this level, the up move is likely to pick up momentum.\n\nOn the other hand, if the ETH/USD pair fails to sustain above $167.32, it might face selling pressure. A breakdown of the 20-day EMA can sink the price to the 50-day SMA. The moving averages are flattening out and the RSI is also gradually correcting toward the midpoint. This points to a consolidation in the short-term. We should see a decisive move within the next few days. Until then, traders can protect their remaining long positions with the stop at $150.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) has held the support at 50-day SMA but is facing resistance at the 20-day EMA. The resistance line of the descending channel is also just above the 20-day EMA. If the bulls scale this resistance, the digital currency can move up to $0.37835. If the price sustains above the channel, it will indicate a likely change in trend.\n\nHowever, if the XRP/USD pair turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA, it can drop to $0.27795. Both the moving averages are flat and the RSI is just below the 50 level. This suggests a consolidation in the near term. As the pair has not participated in the current pullback, we shall wait for a confirmation of a change in trend before recommending a position in it.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has recovered sharply from the fall on April 11. It has again risen close to the top of the $272.41\u2013$332.58 range. We expect it to face a stiff hurdle in the zone of $332.58 to $363.30. But if this overhead resistance zone is crossed, the rally can extend to $451.32. With both the moving averages trending up and the RSI in the positive zone, the bears have the upper hand.\n\nThe BCH/USD pair will lose strength if it turns around from the overhead resistance and dives below the 20-day EMA. \u00a0$239 is the major support on the downside, below which, the pair will turn negative. We shall wait for a reliable buy setup to form before suggesting a long position in it.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) held the 20-day EMA for the past three days, which is a bullish sign. However, the rebound from this support is facing selling at higher levels. If the bulls fail to push the price above the overhead resistance of $91 within the next few days, the bears will again try to sink it below the 20-day EMA.\n\nIf the LTC/USD pair breaks down of the 20-day EMA, it can decline to $62.450. The 50-day SMA is also located at this level, hence, we expect this to hold. But if the 20-day EMA holds and the pair breaks out of $91\u2013$100 resistance zone, it will complete a rounding bottom pattern that has a target objective of $159 and above it $180.\nEOS/USD\nEOS is trying to resume the recovery. On the upside, the bulls will face resistance at $6.0726 and above it at the resistance line. If both these levels are crossed, the rally can extend to $6.8299, which is likely to act as a major barrier. Presently, both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI in positive territory. This shows that the bulls have the upper hand.\n\nContrary to our assumption, if the EOS/USD pair turns down from the current level and plunges below the 20-day EMA, it can drop to $4.4930\u2013$3.8723 support zone. We expect this level to hold. If that happens, the pair might remain range bound between $4.4930 to $6.8299 for a few days. But if the support zone fails to hold, the digital currency might fall toward the lows.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) has risen above the downtrend line and is on its way to the overhead resistance of $22. The pullback from the April 11 low indicates strength. We expect the bulls to push the price above $22 and retest the lifetime highs at $26.4732350. A breakout to new lifetime highs will be a huge sentiment booster to the whole sector as it will prove that the January 2018 highs can be scaled.\n\nBoth the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory. This indicates that the path of least resistance is to the upside. Though we are bullish, we do not find a trade that has an attractive risk to reward ratio. We shall wait for a reliable buy setup to form before proposing a trade in it. Our bullish view will be negated if the BNB/USD pair turns around from one of the overhead resistances and slips below $15.50.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) is facing resistance at the 20-day EMA for the past three days. The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has dipped to 50. This points to a consolidation in the short term.\n\nHowever, if the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the XLM/USD pair can move up to the downtrend line. The pair will signal a trend change if the price sustains above the overhead resistance at $0.14861760.\nOn the contrary, if the bears reverse direction from the current levels, the digital currency can slide to the 50-day SMA. It will turn negative on a breakdown of the uptrend line. We will wait for a reliable buy setup to form before recommending any long positions in it.\nADA/USD\nCardano (ADA) has held the 20-day EMA for the past three days. This shows buying at the support but the bulls have failed to carry the price higher. A breakout above the downtrend line will be the first sign of strength.\n", "birthday": "2019-04-15T19:29:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-15 18:29:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 15}

", "content": "Facebook is controversial, if nothing else. The world's fifth-biggest company by\u00a0market cap, it's also the biggest social network by a\u00a0comfortable margin. Yet, despite the fact that most of us use it, we've become increasingly suspicious of what it's been doing with our personal data. Ever since the\u00a0Cambridge Analytica scandal (and probably long before), we've feared that such data isn't particularly secure or private, so we've been pushing back against the social media giant, as witnessed with last year\u2019s #DeleteFacebook campaign.\nBut at the same time, those with an interest in cryptocurrency also have an appreciation that, for crypto to enter the mainstream, it will need the backing of a big corporation or two. This is why recent news of Facebook's apparent plans for its own cryptocurrency is something of a bittersweet pill to swallow. There's little doubt that the promotion of a digital currency by one of the world's largest companies will put crypto firmly on the map. Yet, given Facebook's reputation, it's hard to shake the suspicion that what Mark Zuckerberg and Co. end up offering won't be a cryptocurrency in the proper, decentralized sense of the word.\nStill, even if Facebook and other social networks won't be producing the next Bitcoin or Monero, their dalliances with blockchain could be a game changer not only for crypto, but for other industries. Finance could be irrevocably altered, as banks and other financial institutions race to accommodate the use of digital currencies by social networks. Similarly, a new ecosystem of crypto-related services and platforms could emerge, as they attempt to capitalize on the creation of new digital money by the likes of Facebook.\nFacebook, Twitter and Telegram\nRumors that Facebook is planning its own cryptocurrency have been circulating since at least last May, when anonymous inside sources\u00a0told media website Cheddar that the social media giant was \"very serious\" about launching an in-app digital currency. Despite remaining unconfirmed, such reports have been bolstered in recent months, with a February article from The New York Times claiming that Facebook has been promoting its soon-to-be-revealed coin to a number of crypto exchanges.\nThe Times report corroborated a December piece from Bloomberg, which once again cited anonymous insiders and which affirmed that the cryptocurrency would be a fiat-pegged\u00a0stablecoin used with WhatsApp, potentially with a focus on money transfers. Regardless of whether the coin would be used by WhatsApp, Facebook or Instagram (all owned by Facebook), it's readily apparent that Facebook is working on some kind of crypto-related project, since, in May 2018, it\u00a0formed a blockchain group headed by David Marcus (a one-time member of the Coinbase board) to explore how its platforms could use crypto.\nIt's therefore only a matter of time before Facebook officially involves itself, in one way or another, in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. And for those working within crypto, such involvement could have significantly positive implications for the industry. As Nigel Green, the CEO of deVere Group, tells Cointelegraph, Facebook's arrival \"would indicate that digital money, as a concept, is fully mainstream and inevitably the way the world is going. This is something we have been arguing for a long time now \u2014 despite protestations from the likes of Warren Buffett.\"\nGreen adds that crypto's place within the mainstream has already been proven by the fact that Facebook and other social networks have been looking into the use of cryptocurrencies for some time. Indeed, aside from Facebook, Twitter has also been flirting with crypto. While there isn\u2019t any reliable indication that it\u2019s planning its own currency, the platform has become increasingly supportive of Bitcoin in recent months, despite temporarily\u00a0banning crypto-related ads in March 2018 (as did Facebook). For example, CEO Jack Dorsey declared in a couple of statements from February that he\u00a0believes Bitcoin will become the internet's \u201cnative currency,\u201d and that Bitcoin is the\u00a0only crypto he owns.\nWhat's more, Twitter itself has been supporting a number of initiatives related to the Lightning Network, such as\u00a0signing the Lightning Torch (aka LN Trust Chain), a project aimed at raising awareness of the network and testing its capabilities. And given that Dorsey is also the\u00a0founder and CEO of Bitcoin-supporting Square, it's perhaps inevitable that Twitter will begin integrating cryptocurrencies into its platform sooner or later.\nEven more inevitably, it's likely that the Russian-founded Telegram will release its\u00a0own GRAM cryptocurrency by October (at the latest), as the popular messaging network plans for the launch of the\u00a0Telegram Open Network (TON), a blockchain platform set to rival Ethereum and EOS for the development and deployment of\u00a0DApps. Telegram already boasts over\u00a0200 million monthly active users (as of a year ago), so it\u2019s likely that a large number of people are going to have the chance to use crypto on a daily basis once TON goes live.\nCentralized or decentralized?\nMuch the same applies to the recently launched VK Coin from\u00a0Vkontakte, another social network and the third most popular website in Russia. Combined with the movements from Telegram, Twitter and Facebook, such designs could see the world's social media titans become some of the biggest players in the crypto industry, if not the biggest players. And according to Green, this should give existing cryptocurrencies and platforms serious cause for concern.\n\"Facebook and Twitter have enormous influence, resources and reach, and it could be that they would take away some market share from existing cryptocurrencies.\"\nHowever, while it's hard to shake the impression that Facebook (and other social media giants) would make big inroads into the cryptocurrency space, it still isn't obvious that the digital currency it's looking to launch will be a truly decentralized cryptocurrency. In light of how Facebook's whole business model revolves around controlling the data generated by its users, casual observers might be forgiven for assuming that it won't entrust the operation and validation of its currency to a scattered network of users, particularly when this currency will apparently be a stablecoin intended for use within the Facebook ecosystem.\n\u201cFacebook or Twitter coin is not a cryptocurrency,\u201d Arthur Hayes \u2014 the CEO and co-founder of BitMex \u2014 told Cointelegraph. Hayes went on, saying:\n\u201cThese will be tokens that ride in their ecosystems. Users must trust these companies to operate the network in good faith and protect their privacy. The only thing any of these tokens will have in common with Bitcoin is that the word \u201ccoin\u201d might possibly be used in their names. These will have little to no effect on Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies that operate on a public peer-to-peer network.\u201d\nSuch doubts regarding decentralization have been reinforced by the news that Vkontakte's recently launched VK Coin\u00a0doesn't appear to make use of blockchain technology in any appreciable way. However, despite such early blows against the credibility of social media coins, there are mixed opinions among experts and commentators as to how centralized any currency from Facebook, Twitter or anyone else would be.\nIqbal V. Gandman \u2014 the managing director of eToro United Kingdom \u2014 believes that Facebook's coin will be mostly centralized, although this doesn't necessarily disqualify it from being a \u201creal\u201d cryptocurrency. \"Cryptocurrencies can be both centralized and decentralized,\" he told Cointelegraph. \"The sheer nature of platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp, means their cryptocurrencies will be centralized. Facebook and Whatsapp are like walled gardens, i.e. you have to login to access them, so I think people will probably only be able to use their coins within those platforms, rather than elsewhere.\"\nCryptoOracle's Lou Kerner is mostly in agreement with such an assessment. \"Facebook is likely to have decentralized elements and centralized elements, as Facebook is obviously centralized and there is no functional decentralized governance system,\" he said to Cointelegraph. But other figures involved in crypto think such skepticism is misplaced, especially since Facebook has been so eager recently to polish its tarnished image.\n\"As far as I can tell, these cryptocurrencies would be decentralized, as Facebook is seeking to capitalize on the phenomenon of crypto, and part of cryptocurrencies\u2019 inherent appeal is the decentralized status,\" says Green. \"After the recent Facebook furor regarding user privacy, I think we can expect them to double down in regard to this area as the scrutiny will be immense.\"\nOf course, the debate over the true meaning of \u201cdecentralized\u201d could last until the end of time, yet it's likely that control over Facebook's coin won't be entirely centralized. Not only would this defeat the purpose of launching a cryptocurrency (as opposed to some system of digital credits or vouchers), but it would contradict the aforementioned reports that claim that Facebook has been talking with crypto exchanges. If Facebook is planning to put its coin on exchanges, then clearly it's comfortable with the idea of it being traded and disseminated outside of its jurisdiction.\nUser experience = adoption\nBesides decentralization, another big question surrounding the prospect of social media cryptocurrencies is whether they might overcomplicate the user experience. Platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram are popular largely because they're so simple to use. Introducing cryptocurrencies and crypto payments could therefore be a delicate business, seeing as how a lay person still doesn't really understand how crypto works.\nSuch fears might seem superficially rational, but they're likely to be unfounded. \"Companies like Facebook and Twitter are conscious that the key to a good product is a user-friendly interface,\" explains eTor\u2019s managing director, Iqbal V. Gandam. \"Introducing their own cryptocurrencies should not make these platforms more complicated for users, it will simply be another service for them to use.\"\nThis seems to be the consensus among other commentators, all of whom point to the storied history such platforms as Facebook have in making their interfaces addictively simple to use. \"Anything Facebook or WhatsApp does will be drop dead simple,\" affirms Lou Kerner. \"That's why they're Facebook and WhatsApp.\"\nIn fact, it's likely that the user experience of a Facebook or Twitter Coin would be so simple that, rather than turning people off Facebook or Twitter, it will actually turn more people onto cryptocurrencies by making them realize that crypto needn't be complicated. \"The impact of these platforms launching cryptoassets on the crypto industry will be much bigger,\" says Gandam. \"It will help take the utilization of crypto by the public a step forward. Just as Paypal raised its awareness and usage by working with eBay.\"\nAnd because crypto and blockchain are already riding a wave of adoption, it's likely that the two processes could converge in a way that creates a kind of positive feedback loop, thereby accelerating overall adoption. \"More and more people are becoming used to cryptocurrencies and mass adoption is increasing momentum all the time, so I don\u2019t think it will be an issue,\" says Green, who believes that, far from overcomplicating things, crypto will \"enhance the user experience\" for Facebook and other adoptive platforms.\nNew economies\nSo, there's a general consensus that Facebook and other social media platforms are planning to launch their own cryptocurrencies, and that such currencies would be positive for the platforms concerned and for their users. The question is: What kind of wider ramifications would a Facebook Coin, Twitter Coin or GRAM have?\nMost significantly, it's possible that such coins could spark a shift in personal banking and finance, especially when Facebook's likely crypto will be a stablecoin pegged to the value of a number of fiat currencies. \"All cryptocurrencies and wider fintech solutions are already taking business away from traditional banks,\" Green explains. \"They are filling a gap left by the traditional way of doing things as the world speeds up and becomes increasingly globalized and digitalized.\"", "birthday": "2019-04-12T15:14:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-12 14:14:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 12}
{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/will-china-ban-crypto-mining", "title": " Will China Ban Crypto Mining? ", "content": "On April 9, Reuters reported that a Chinese government agency is considering the elimination of crypto mining in the country. Given that China has been hosting the majority of mining pools on its soil, the global crypto industry might be poised to take a massive hit. However, the plan is not written in stone at this point, and part of community has dismissed it as casual FUD.\nBrief introduction to China\u2019s relationship with crypto\nChinese authorities have been spearheading the \u201cblockchain before Bitcoin\u201d approach since September 2017, when the infamous crackdown on local initial coin offerings (ICOs) and crypto exchanges occurred. As of now, people in China can hold cryptocurrencies, but they are prohibited from trading them.\nThe local mining industry specifically has also been subject to repressions. In February 2018, CNN Money reported that the Chinese government pushed crypto miners to make an \"orderly exit\" from the industry due to tax issues and mining being generally dangerous for the environment.\nIndeed, according to a separate article published by Quartz a month earlier, the country\u2019s top internet-finance regulator, the Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation, ordered local authorities to use all available options \u2014 such as \u201cmeasures linked to electricity prices, land use, tax, and environmental protection\u201d \u2014 to force miners to shut down their business. In addition to that, the agency had allegedly obliged regional authorities to submit regular progress reports, detailing the existing mining facilities in their jurisdictions.\nIn response to the intensifying crackdown, some of China's largest mining players chose to move shop or even change their main line of business. Thus, Chinese ASIC chip manufacturer and mining outfit Bitmain, once the industry\u2019s most profitable company, which is now experiencing significant difficulties caused by the bear market, decided to turn to artificial intelligence (AI) as an alternate revenue source. \u201cAs a China company, we have to be prepared,'' Bitmain\u2019s former co-chief executive, Jihan Wu, explained at the time. The company also planned to run a major mining operation in Rockdale, Texas, but had to suspend the plan due to the market collapse earlier this year.\nHowever, China remains a mining superpower. According to data from Blockchain.com, most of the largest Bitcoin mining pools are controlled by Chinese organizations. An earlier study conducted by the University of Cambridge argued that the Chinese dominance in the mining market was made possible by the cheap electricity and land available in provincial areas such as Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan and Sichuan. Reports issued around the same time indicated that over two-thirds of global mining pools were based in China.\nNew plans: NDRC to dismiss mining as an eco-unfriendly activity\nNow, China's central state planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), has revealed it might curb crypto mining in the country altogether. Notably, the news was first broken by state-owned newspaper the Securities Times, who reported that the NDRC\u2019s draft list \u201cdistinctly reflects the attitude of the country\u2019s industrial policy\u201d toward the cryptocurrency industry, as per Reuters.\nThus, the NDRC has reportedly included crypto mining as part of its draft for a revised list of industrial activities the agency intends to shut down because they \u201clacked safe production conditions, seriously wasted resources, polluted the environment,\u201d among other issues.\nThe move forms part of the NDRC\u2019s wider Catalogue for Guiding Industry Restructuring, which has been issued since 2005 and determines which industries are to be encouraged, restricted or eliminated in the country.\nThe agency has reportedly not set a proposed deadline for eliminating crypto mining industry, postulating instead that it should be dwindled with immediate effect. The public now has until May 7 to comment on the draft.\nAs local newspaper South China Morning Post reported, the new plan brings uncertainty not only to local miners, but to the makers of cryptocurrency mining rigs as well. That would include the aforementioned Bitmain, which, in 2017, controlled an estimated three-quarters of the global market, as well as Canaan Creative, another large Chinese mining hardware manufacturer. Both companies had filed for initial public offerings (IPOs) in Hong Kong, but were met with skepticism by the local watchdog.\nAdditionally, according to its IPO filing, by mid-2018, Bitmain operated as many as 11 mining farms in China, and hence would be largely affected by the NDRC\u2019s reported plans. The company has declined to comment on the issue, as per various media reports.\nCommunity reaction\nHistorically, big news from China tends to affect the crypto market. For instance, when local regulators introduced yet another restraint on cryptocurrencies in January last year, Bitcoin swiftly dropped to its lowest level in more than a month, with Ethereum (ETH) declining 19% and Ripple (XRP) collapsing 29%.\nSimilarly, the new ban, if implemented, is likely to have a strong impact on the global crypto industry, argue some crypto mining consultants, such as Mark D\u2019Aria of Bitpro Consulting LLC. \u201cShort term, it could be extremely disruptive,\u201d he told Cointelegraph. He went on to say:\n\u201cThere will certainly be many winners and losers in the mining industry, as non-Chinese miners would benefit in the short term from significantly reduced difficulty, and from inexpensive surplus hardware as it filters out of China.\u201d\nHowever, the ultimate effect largely depends on how, if and when the ban is implemented, D\u2019Aria argues, which is unclear at this time:\n\u201cIf it was decreed that all miners were to shut down immediately, all of that hashrate lost in an instant could significantly disrupt the technical operation of the Bitcoin blockchain, slowing it down significantly until the next difficulty reduction. If this ban was implemented shortly after the last difficulty adjustment, this transitional period could last months.\u201d\nIn the worst-case scenario, D\u2019Aria explains, it could take months for the network to bounce back \u2014 but either way, the Bitcoin blockchain should be safe in the long run.\n\u201cIt's yet another example of how resilient Bitcoin actually is \u2014 it can be disrupted in the short term, but long term it adjusts to compensate.\u201d\nHe elaborated:\n\u201cDifficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks. This takes approximately every two weeks at a stable hashrate. If 80% of the hashrate were to go offline 16 blocks after the adjustment, the next 2000 blocks would take 5x as long to mine (assuming the hardware wasn't rapidly redeployed outside of China.) This two week period would stretch out to over two months. During these two months transaction rate would also be slowed down by 80%, confirmations that used to take minutes will take hours and fees will likely rise dramatically due to competition for block space. At a time when Bitcoin is still widely criticized for being slow and expensive to use, it's hardly going to do Bitcoin any favors. [...] But if China allows miners to wind down over a few weeks, difficulty adjustment will gracefully handle the loss in hash rate, and there would be little noticeable change to the functioning of the Bitcoin blockchain.\u201d\nIf the ban does come through, however, part of the mining economy could move underground, but the overall scope of mining operations won\u2019t be the same for China, which might be dethroned by other countries in that case, D\u2019Aria said:\n\u201cIt [cryptocurrency mining in China] can continue at a very small scale \u2014 a basement here, a shed there, etc. However, it is not plausible that large mining farms would be using megawatts of electricity without the authorities noticing. Even if a few chinese miners try to carry on at a small scale, on a global level it would be insignificant. The US, Canada, Scandinavia and a few Eastern European nations would then comprise the lion's share of mining power \u2014 and in all likelihood the mining hardware would eventually filter outside of China to those who can still use it.\u201d\n\u201cChina FUD\u201d?\nOther parts of the crypto community don\u2019t see any reason to panic whatsoever. For instance, Dovey Wan, founding partner at blockchain-focused Primitive Ventures, pointed out that the NDRC\u2019s purview in regard to the industries it wants to eliminate seems limited:\nthere is another version of such proposal published in 2011 https://t.co/BY2unufFbdObviously many stuff should be \u201celiminated\u201d in the 2011 version reappear in the 2019 version \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43 such proposal in China usually is just \u201cproposal\u201d\u2014 Dovey Wan \ud83e\udd96 (@DoveyWan) April 9, 2019\n\nA similar viewpoint was expressed by an independent crypto industry analyst Katherine Wu, who told Wired that this clampdown seems to be more indirect compared to previous crypto regulations in the country, and many industries on the commission\u2019s list of wasteful activities are still far from what\u2019s described under \u201cimmediate elimination.\u201d\n\u201cIt is categorized as an industry that is not encouraged or allowed to expand, but it is not a ban,\u201d Zhao Qianjie, a former employee at BTCChina exchange, told The New York Times, arguing that the government might not impose strict sanctions for local miners.", "birthday": "2019-04-12T08:12:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-12 07:12:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 12}

Harvard Endowment fund is expected to participate in the purchase. \u00a0\u00a0\nWhile the blockchain and cryptocurrency space has a lot of potential, their adoption is still not widespread.

However, Frank Xiong, vice president of blockchain product development at Oracle expects 50 percent of all companies to use blockchain within the next three years.\nThe developments in the sector are encouraging, but the industry still lacks the full-fledged involvement of institutional players. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon has denied that the bank ever wanted to open a crypto trading desk, as reported by the media a few months back.\nAfter the recent spell of profit booking, let\u2019s see what the charts project.\nBTC/USD\nWe were expecting Bitcoin (BTC) to rally to $5,600 and above it to $5,900 following the breakout above $5,309.31. But the digital currency turned down from $5,404.82. It is currently attempting to hold the support at $4,914.11. The 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the recent upswing is also located close to this level. If the price rebounds from the current levels, it will indicate that sentiment has changed from sell on rallies to buy on dips. The immediate target on the upside is $5,600 and above it $5,900.\n\nBoth the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. This shows that the bulls are in command and the trend remains up.\nThe BTC/USD pair will turn negative if it turns down from the current level and slides below the 20-day EMA. Therefore, we suggest traders keep the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $4,600.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) declined below the breakout level of $167.32 on April 11. This is a bearish sign. After a breakout of a major pattern like the ascending triangle, we expected the $167.32 level to hold. However, the bulls are trying to defend the 20-day EMA. If they can push the price back above $167.32 quickly, it will indicate buying at lower levels.\n\nThe ETH/USD pair will pick up momentum if the bulls scale above $187.98. The target remains $251.64. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns around from the current levels or from $187.98 and plummets below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will confirm that the breakout was a bull trap. For now, traders can retain the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $150.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) broke below the immediate support of $0.350 and the 20-day EMA on April 11. It has again re-entered the descending channel, which is a bearish sign. The bulls are presently trying to defend the 50-day SMA.\n\nBoth the moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is close to 50. This points to a consolidation in the short-term. If the XRP/USD pair rises above the resistance line of the descending channel, it might move up to $0.37835. A breakout of this level will signal a change in trend that can be bought.\nHowever, if the pair breaks down of the 50-day SMA, it can drop to $0.27795. We do not find any reliable buy setup at the current level; hence, we are not suggesting any trade in it.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) witnessed profit booking as it failed to climb above $91 on April 10. The correction stalled at the 20-day EMA. Currently, the bulls are trying to stabilize the price around the 20-day EMA and resume the recovery.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI has dropped to just above the midpoint. This suggests consolidation in the short term. However, the long-term trend remains up as the 50-day SMA is still trending higher.\nThe LTC/USD pair will face resistance in the $91 to $100 zone on the upside. If this zone is crossed, the next targets to watch are $159 and above it $180. On the other hand, if the pair sinks below the 20-day EMA, it can fall to $62.450. We will watch for a couple of days before recommending long positions once again.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) dipped below the range of $272.41 to $332.58 and triggered our suggested stop loss of $265 on the remaining long positions. Currently, it is attempting to bounce back from the 20-day EMA, which is a positive sign. This shows that the bulls are keen to defend the first major support of the 20-day EMA.\n\nThe BCH/USD pair can now move up to $332.58 and above it to $363.30. If the bulls push the price above this resistance, the rally can extend to $451.32. There is a minor resistance at $400 but we expect it to be crossed. Both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is in the positive zone. This indicates that the bulls have the upper hand.\nHowever, if the bulls fail to push the price above $332.58, the digital currency might remain range bound between $255 and $332.58 for a few days. We shall wait for a reliable buy setup to form before proposing long positions once again. The trend will favor the bears if the cryptocurrency dives below $239.\nEOS/USD\nAs the RSI was deeply overbought, we had recommended trailing the remaining long positions with a close stop loss in our previous analysis. EOS reversed direction from the resistance line on April 10. Due to the fall, the RSI has dropped out of the overbought zone.\n\nThe bulls are trying to bounce off the 20-day EMA. If successful, the EOS/USD pair might again move up to the resistance line and if that is crossed the up-move can extend to $6.8299. With both the moving averages still sloping up, the bulls are at an advantage.\nOur positive view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below the 20-day EMA. In such a case, the digital currency might consolidate in a large range of $4.4930\u2013$6.8299 for a few more days.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) broke down of the ascending channel and the 20-day EMA on April 11, but buying on dips has again pushed the price back above the 20-day EMA, which is a positive sign. It shows that the bulls continue to buy on every dip and have been defending the 20-day EMA aggressively.\n\nWith the recent correction, the 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has dipped back into neutral territory. This points to a range formation in the short term. Nonetheless, the long-term trend still remains up as the 50-day SMA is sloping up.\nThe BNB/USD pair might rise to $22 after it closes above the downtrend line. On the downside, it has strong support at the 50-day SMA. We remain positive on the pair and will suggest long positions once again at the first available opportunity. Our bullish view will be negated if the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) continues to trade inside the wedge. It slipped below the 20-day EMA and triggered our recommended stop loss of $0.1130 on the remaining long position. Currently, the bulls are trying to defend the 50-day SMA.\n\nBoth the moving averages are flattening out and the RSI has dipped back to the neutral zone. This points to a consolidation in the near term. The XLM/USD pair has support at the uptrend line and resistance at $0.14861760. It will pick up momentum and signal a trend change if it sustains above $0.14861760. Until then, we remain neutral on the digital currency.\nADA/USD\nCardano (ADA) turned around from the overhead resistance of $0.094256 and plunged below the support at $0.082952 on April 11. The down move triggered our suggest stop loss at $0.080 on the remaining long positions. It is currently attempting to bounce off the 20-day EMA, which is a positive sign. The bulls will again try to ascend the overhead resistance of $0.094256. If successful, the target on the upside is $0.20 with a minor resistance at $0.112598", "birthday": "2019-04-12T19:25:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-12 18:25:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 12}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nThe smart money sells when the whole market and especially the retail players are overly bullish. Similarly, these large players enter the markets when the sentiment is bearish and people are waiting to dump their positions. After the extended bear market and huge erosion in prices, retail traders are wary of entering the crypto markets.\nThe total Bitcoin trading volume has been on a decline for the past few months but the institutional players seem to be accumulating at the lower levels. The trades by institutions, when compared to the total volume, have increased from 15 percent in January of this year to 19 percent in April, according to a report by Diar.\nBack in July of last year, institutional trades rose to 24 percent of the total but it soon petered out with the breakdown of the $5,900 support on Bitcoin. The current rise in volume shows that institutions are confident of a recovery this time.\nFacebook is seeking up to $1 billion in venture capital to develop its digital currency \u2014 rumored to be a stablecoin that will be pegged to a basket of fiat currencies \u2014 according to the New York Times. These developments show that serious money is waiting to invest in the nascent asset class at every available opportunity. Will this result in a sustained uptrend or will the rally fizzle out again? Let\u2019s look at the charts.\nBTC/USD\nAfter a minor correction on April 9, Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to resume its recovery. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone. Deeply overbought readings on the RSI warn that the up-move is getting overextended. However, if such a reading is seen during the rally after an extended downtrend, it suggests that the bulls are unwilling to book profits after a short upswing and a trend change is in the offing.\n\nAbove $5,309.31, the BTC/USD pair can rally to $5,674.84 and if this level is crossed, the next major barrier is $5,900. We anticipate a stiff resistance at $5,900, hence, traders can book profits on the remaining long positions between $5,600 and $5,900.\nContrary to our expectation, if the pair reverses direction from the current levels, it can drop to the $4,914.11\u2013$4,800 support zone. If this zone also fails to provide support, the next stop is the 20-day EMA. We expect this level to hold. Hence, traders can keep a stop loss of $4,600 for now.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) has been sustaining above the breakout level of $167.32 for the past three days, which is a bullish sign. As it has broken out of an ascending triangle pattern, it has a target objective of $251.64.\n\nBoth the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. This suggests that the bulls are in a strong position.\nAny correction from the current levels will find support at $167.32 and below it at the 20-day EMA. We expect the ETH/USD pair to bounce from one of these support levels. Hence, we have recommended a stop loss of $150 on the remaining long position. If the 20-day EMA breaks down, the slide can extend to the 50-day SMA and below it to the trendline of the ascending triangle. We will raise the stops again in a couple of days.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) continues to trade in a tight range. It has been taking support close to $0.350 for the past four days. A breakdown of this level can drag the price to the support at $0.33108. The 20-day EMA is just above this level, hence, we expect the support to hold.\n\nOn the other hand, if the XRP/USD pair rises from the current levels, it can move up to $0.40, above which a rally to $0.45 is probable. The 20-day EMA is sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory, which suggests that the bulls are at a marginal advantage. We like the way the pair has held above the descending channel after breaking out of it. However, the failure to attract buyers even when the sentiment is improving across the sector is a negative sign. Currently, we remain neutral on the digital currency.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) is in a strong uptrend. The correction from close to $98 did not even reach the 20-day EMA, which shows that the bulls are aggressively buying the dips. With the current three-day correction, the RSI has alleviated its deeply overbought readings. Both the moving averages continue to slope up. All these confirm that the bulls are in the driver\u2019s seat. On a breakout and close above $100, the digital currency can rally to $159 and above it to $180.\n\nOn the downside, the LTC/USD pair can correct to the 20-day EMA. The resistance line of the ascending channel is also located at this level. Hence, we expect a strong bounce off this support. We shall try to re-enter the long positions again if we spot a favorable buy setup. However, if the pair slumps below the 20-day EMA, it will lose momentum and can fall to the 50-day SMA.\nBCH/USD\nFollowing the sharp up-move on April 2 and 3, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been consolidating in a range of $272.41 to $332.58. The price turned down from the top of the range on April 8 and can now decline to the bottom of the range at $272.41. If this support breaks, a fall to $239 is probable. Traders can trail the stops on the remaining long positions to $265.\n\nAs both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI has corrected from its deeply overbought level, the trend favors the bulls. If the BCH/USD pair breaks out of $332.58, it can resume the uptrend. On a breakout above $363.30, it can move up to $468.73, with a minor resistance at $400.\nEOS/USD\nAfter rising gradually for the past few days, EOS made a decisive move today. It is now on target to reach the overhead resistance of $6.8299. Both the moving averages are sloping up, which shows that the trend is up. However, as the RSI has entered into overbought territory, we suggest traders trail the remaining long positions with a close stop loss.\n\nThe zone between $6 and $6.8299 is likely to act as a stiff resistance. If the EOS/USD pair turns down from this resistance zone, it might remain range bound between $4.4930 and $6.8299 for a few more days. Contrary to our assumption, if the bulls succeed in pushing the price above $6.8299, a rally to $9 is possible.\nBNB/USD\nWe had proposed trailing the stop loss on the remaining long positions below the 20-day EMA in our previous analysis. As Binance Coin (BNB) dipped below the 20-day EMA on April 9, it triggered our suggested stop loss.\n\nThe BNB/USD pair is attempting to bounce off the 20-day EMA, which is a positive sign. If successful, it will again try to break out of the overhead resistance at $22 and retest the lifetime highs.\nHowever, the negative divergence on the RSI is a warning sign. If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, it can slide to the 50-day SMA. The trend remains bullish. We shall wait for a new buy setup to form before recommending long positions once again.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) has dipped back close to the 20-day EMA, which is likely to offer strong support. If the price rebounds from the current levels, it is likely to reach the overhead resistance at $0.14861760. This level will act as a major roadblock, but if the bulls push the price above this level, we can expect the downtrend to be over.\n\nBoth the moving averages are gradually sloping up, which shows that the bulls have the upper hand. But if the XLM/USD pair fails to bounce off the 20-day EMA, it can slide to the 50-day SMA. Therefore, traders can keep a stop loss of $0.1130 on the remaining long position.\nADA/USD", "birthday": "2019-04-10T20:19:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-10 19:19:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 10}

", "content": "Year-to-date, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) is up 40% against the United States dollar, and other major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Litecoin have also demonstrated strong gains in the past four months.\n\nPerformance of crypto assets in the past month. Source: coin360.io\nLitecoin, for instance, recorded a staggering 208% increase in value since January \u2014 outperforming most crypto assets apart from a handful, including Binance Coin and Enjin Coin.\nFrom April 1 to April 3, based on CoinMarketCap data, the price of Bitcoin surged from $4,100 to $5,041, by around 22% against the U.S. dollar.\n\nAfter experiencing a slight retracement, Bitcoin along with Ethereum and the rest of the cryptocurrency market are showing signs of new momentum, with BTC recently breaching $5,200.\n\nWhat caused the initial rally on April 1?\nThe rally of Bitcoin in the first week of April is said to have been triggered by four major factors:\nAbsorption of an $80 million sell wall at a key resistance in $4,200.The liquidation of short contracts worth $500 million.Lack of resistance above $4,200.The reported purchase by one buyer of $100 million worth of Bitcoin\nAround $500m in liquidations on Bitmex alone, ouch____________________chart @TensorCharts pic.twitter.com/wePyX7hbL7\u2014 Edward Morra (@edwardmorra_btc) April 2, 2019\n\nThe $4,200 resistance level has been a roadblock for the near-term recovery of Bitcoin since January, and every attempt to break out of it led the price of BTC dipping below $4,000. As soon as the crucial resistance level was breached cleanly for the first time in 2019, Bitcoin began to move up rapidly toward $5,000.\nBut, one potentially overlooked factor in analyzing the price trend of Bitcoin in the beginning of April may have been the dominance of Bitcoin futures markets based in the U.S.\nDue to the relatively small volume of major futures markets such as CME Group, the impact of futures on the price trend of Bitcoin was believed to be minimal by many.\nDanny Les, a former hedge fund manager, told Cointelegraph in February that the downside movement of Bitcoin two months ago was not likely to have been affected by futures:\n\u201cI don\u2019t think futures closing made a difference. Just like when the CME Bitcoin markets kicked off and everyone expected it would have a huge effect on price. It didn\u2019t. Same applies here as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\nHowever, on March 22, Bitwise Asset Management disclosed in its presentation to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that 35% of Bitcoin trading volume in February was processed through CME and CBOE futures.\n\u201cAnd, when you remove fake volume, CME and CBOE futures volume is significant ($91M), especially compared to the real spot volume (35% for Feb 2019). This is good news because it means CME \u2014 a regulated, surveilled market \u2014 is of material size, which important for an ETF.\u201d\nFrom March 4 to 8, Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, processed $110 million worth of Bitcoin trades. In the same time frame, according to Bitwise\u2019s report, CME and CBOE processed $91 million.\nAt least until March, the volume of Bitcoin futures markets in the U.S. neared that of the Bitcoin volume of the biggest exchange in the global cryptocurrency market.\nIn the future, with CBOE\u2019s reported pullout from the Bitcoin futures market, the share of the futures market in the volume of BTC could change, but in the general scheme of things, Bitwise has shown that futures markets can no longer be dismissed when analyzing the price of Bitcoin.\nWhat can stimulate the next rally?\nThe liquidation of short contracts and the large volume coming from U.S.-based futures markets were crucial in fueling the momentum of Bitcoin in early April, acting as near-term price catalysts.\nBitcoin has not been in the $5,000 region since early November, and pushing through September and October levels in the $6,000 to $7,000 range would require proper fundamental and technical factors to gain new momentum.\nPurely based on fundamentals, the block reward halving of the Bitcoin network that is expected to occur in May 2020 could have an impact on the price of the asset in the near-term.\nHistorically, as several analysts suggested, the price of Bitcoin has tended to increase in value about a year before its halving.\nHistorical data shows that about a year before the halving, the cost of Bitcoin starts to go up.In 2012 and 2016, the exchange rate occurred 376 and 320 days before the halving of the miners reward.#cryptocurrency #bitcoin #btc #Trader #crypto #trading $btc pic.twitter.com/i1SQVBYXy7\u2014 Gems Caller (@gemscaller) March 29, 2019\n\nArguments against the halving theory certainly exist due to the rising mainstream awareness of Bitcoin and its halving mechanism. The main argument is that, because halving is already anticipated by investors, it may not have a noticeable effect on the price.\nBut, Bitcoin is nearing its fixed supply of 21 million and the restriction the halving would put on the circulating supply of the asset is highly likely to affect the price of the asset, especially if the demand remains at the current level or even rises in the months to come.\nSo far, 84% of the fixed supply of Bitcoin has already been issued, and several reports from firms such as Chainalysis have shown that a few million BTC could be lost permanently.\nIn late 2017, Fortune exclusively reported that 4 million BTC is estimated to be lost permanently, possibly from hacking attacks, loss of private keys and many other reasons.\nAt the time, Kim Grauer, a senior economist at Chainalysis, said that it is difficult to conclusively state that the lost BTC is priced into the market because the projected market cap of Bitcoin does not consider BTC that is out of circulation:\n\u201cThat is a very complex question. On the one hand, direct calculations about market cap do not take lost coins into consideration. Considering how highly speculative this field is, those market cap calculations may make it into economic models of the market that impact spending activity. Yet the market has adapted to the actual demand and supply available \u2014 just look at exchange behavior. Furthermore, it is well known monetary policy procedure to lower or increase fiat reserves to impact exchange rates. So the answer is yes and no.\u201d\nConsidering the relatively large portion of the supply of BTC and the upcoming halving that would further slow down the rate at which new BTC is mined and would significantly reduce the available supply of the asset, an overall increase in value can be expected.\n\nIndependent price movements show maturation of the crypto market\nIn many areas, as ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees stated, crypto is maturing.\nCrypto is maturing. It is now firmly in its adolescence.\u2014 Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) March 29, 2019\n\nIn terms of industry development, regulation, merchant adoption, infrastructure building and security, the cryptocurrency industry has seen significant progress in recent months.\nAnother strong indicator of the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency market is the emergence of independent price movements.\nIn the past four months, a fairly large number of crypto assets \u2014 such as Litecoin, Enjin Coin, Binance Coin, Augur, Ontology, Cardano and EOS \u2014 have shown price movements independent from that of BTC.", "birthday": "2019-04-09T18:06:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-09 17:06:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 9}

The Crypto Valley Association (CVA) was undergoing a major reorganization. On Thursday, Jan. 31, the General Assembly of the Association elected former Swisscom manager Daniel Haudenschild as president of the CVA and the successor to Oliver Bussmann.\nThe former CVA\u2019s president, Oliver Bussmann, had announced last November \u2014 together with the members Vasily Suvorov, Ren\u00e9 H\u00fcsler and Nicolas Schobinger \u2014 not to run for reelection at the General Assembly. The former SAP and UBS manager, who runs a consulting firm in Zug, had been controversial, according to media reports. According to finews.ch, he and other members had been accused of using the organization for personal business. Haudenschild, the new president of the CVA, was \u2014 until the end of January \u2014 the CEO of the blockchain advisory unit of Swiss state-owned telecommunications company Swisscom and left the company unexpectedly. The reasons for leaving have not been announced by Swisscom.\nOther board members were Kevin Lally, Kamales Lardi, Mattia Rattaggi and Martin Berweger. Immediately after the end of the meeting on Jan. 31, two board members \u2014 Maria Gomez and Jenna Zenk \u2014 also resigned. Both had been elected as female representatives to the board in September. In a Twitter post, Zenk, the head of technology at Zug blockhouse startup Melonport, cited the reason for her departure in a short video from the General Assembly: One member sharply criticized the one-sided composition of the board of directors with lawyers, investors and advisers.\nCointelegraph spoke with Daniel Haudenschild about his new position, conflicts between the management staff and the developer community in the Crypto Valley and the position of Switzerland, especially Zug, as a global blockchain hub.\u00a0\nCT: The four founding members of the CVA \u2014 Oliver Bussmann, Ren\u00e9 H\u00fcsler, Nicolas Schobinger and Vasily Suvorov \u2014 have announced their withdrawal from the organization quite surprisingly. How do you judge this decision?\nDH: The CVA is a vital component for Switzerland, and one of the strongest ecosystems in blockchain globally. It also grew at an advanced pace without pause. So some of the basic inventories and systems that other associations have are and were not present in the CVA. The result is that the mechanics of how the CVA works, how it handles expansion, how it does membership recruitment all were inappropriately addressed. The previous board fell under some criticism and felt it best to hand over for a clean start.\nCT: Two board members resigned, saying that there were too many lawyers and consultants on the board. What do you think?\nDH: The work that we need to do now is basic. We need to address the toolset of the CVA with a proper association management system. We need to empower the regional chapters, we need to restructure the sponsorship packages, and offer clarity and transparency association financials. The board has therefore decided that we will not be electing the additional two members at this time. By making some of the tools fit for purpose we take a big step in handling some of the basic administrative needs of the association. Once the CVA is running smoothly, we will open the process to bring on two new board members. These will be determined by the needs of the association and will most likely be from the startup community.\nCT: According to the netzwoche.ch platform, the CVA had conflicts between the management staff and the developer community. Could you please explain what exactly were the misunderstandings?\nDH: The perception was that the inquiries into the CVA were being handed off to a select few individuals, and that most members did not have access to the business-generating benefits of membership. Although this may have been the case in a few occurrences, the frustration was felt by everyone, and it was mostly the fault of inappropriate systems and resources to help deal with the flood of inquiries. We have taken concrete steps to solve this by investing in a new tool system. We have also eliminated strategic corporate sponsorships. These have proven to divide the valley.\nCompanies who purchased them felt they were not receiving value, and other smaller members felt that they could not compete with the larger corporates for attention. We now have only two levels of association sponsorship, and two prices: 5,000 and 10,000 [Swiss francs]. All other sponsorship is aimed at events. This levels the playing field.\nCT: Which solutions for conflict resolution do you suggest?\nDH: In addition to the above, we have an ethics officer and two delegates. This is a strong team and should be able to handle conflicts and other issues that arise now or in the future.\nCT: What projects do you want to tackle as the new president of the CVA?\nDH: We need to bring the capital back into the valley. The persistent bear market in BTC prices has driven away a lot of the nonsense that came with the ICO hype. However, the VC and Angel funds have also partially left. This is unfortunate, as we have some brilliant young teams and founders here. It is an absolute buyer\u2019s market.\nThe next Google and Amazon are already out there. We need to help them get access to capital and the other ecosystem components that they need to start successfully.\nCT: What challenges is the CVA currently facing?\nDH: We are understaffed and looking for talent. As a not-for-profit entity this will presumably be the case in perpetuity.\nCT: In which direction is the Swiss blockchain industry developing, especially in the Crypto Valley?\nDH: There has been a flash in the pan regarding the ICO hype. This has brought a lot of unserious players. The persisted bear market has driven most of these away again. Quietly and continuously serious development in the blockchain space has gone on unabated. We are seeing more registrations for blockchain applications that are not cryptocurrency based, we have seen significant investment by corporates and individuals for education, and we have seen major investment by banks and hedge funds in digital asset storage. So, we see continued development of security tokens, asset-backed tokens and stablecoins as a natural extension of this.\nCT: Where are the biggest hurdles?\nDH: The learning curve for most enterprises is still steep, and it still lies ahead. For consumer adoption, although we are seeing massive advances in consumer technologies for digital asset management (for example, the Samsung smart phone with a built-in crypto wallet), we still need to make the whole experience much more user friendly. The high street is ready for the change. They will quickly adapt and drop the 3 percent credit card fees they currently pay off their margin.", "birthday": "2019-04-10T09:56:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-10 08:56:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 10}

The company claims that the new chip is three times more powerful than its predecessor, the Antminer Z9, which was released nine months ago.\nIntroducing the #AntminerZ11 that packs 3X more hashing power than its predecessor! The Z11 mines #Zcash under the Equihash algorithm. Performing with a hash rate of 135 KSol/s and power consumption of 1418 W. Click here (https://t.co/woThhXNxjd) to learn more. pic.twitter.com/HzCLKR7dVc\u2014 Antminer_main (@Antminer_main) March 19, 2019\n\nDespite the fact that the Zcash team declined to comment on this news, the release of the Z11 produced mixed reactions among community members. Some of them believe that this is a new threat to network security, while others see the release as a potential for the growth of the coin\u2019s price.\nASIC resistance campaign\nIn 2017, after Bitmain's dominance of the ASIC market reached a peak with the release of Bitcoin (BTC) mining equipment, the Chinese giant set about developing specialized chips for mining other coins with large market capitalizations, such as Ethereum (ETH), SiaCoin (SIA), Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC).\nHigh-performance miners allowed their operators to quickly gain a significant amount of coins, while the owners of such farms could also launch 51 percent attacks that allow one to usurp control of the network and manipulate transactions.\nSome developers decided to go along the path of changing their algorithms in order to make the network ASIC-resistant. Take, for example, Monero, which hard forked their network on April 6, 2018, after Bitmain announced the release of Antminer X3. The same path was chosen by Bitcoin Gold (BTG), which forked its network on July 3 after the Antminer Z9 was released.\nAfter a lengthy debate, the Ethereum team made partial modifications to the network on the way to its transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to programmatic proof-of-work (ProgPoW). The hard fork was implemented on Feb. 28 this year.\nOther projects abandoned the idea of ASIC resistance, and among them was Zcash. On May 3, 2018, Bitmain announced the release of the Z9 mini model for mining Zcash and other coins based on the Equihash algorithm.\nZooko Wilcox, co-founder and CEO of the company, took a neutral position on the issue of ASIC resistance, saying that no changes to the network were planned.\nLater, a survey was conducted among members of the Zcash community, and the results showed that the majority of respondents voted against prioritizing ASIC resistance policy.\nMeet Z11\nTypically, Bitmain announces its new models shortly before the start of sales, and this is exactly what they did with the Antminer Z11. On March 19, Bitmain announced the release of a new model for mining Equihash-powered coins, and the firm explained that the chip would be three times more powerful than the previous generation Z9 device.\nThis time, Bitmain decided not to limit itself to the technical description of the product and made a special announcement paying specific attention to the Zcash community. The company promised to provide real-time updates on the volumes of supplies and its own equipment stocks, as well as to fight \"hidden\" mining:\n\u201cTo preserve the Zcash community\u2019s values around security, reliability and accessibility, Bitmain had previously\u00a0Tweeted real-time updates to ensure more transparency and will continue to provide shipping updates of the first batch of the Antminer Z11. These\u00a0commitments to transparency will continue to provide the Zcash foundation and community with the security, reliability and accessibility they desire of manufacturers.\u201d\nAccording to the manufacturer, the computing power of Antminer Z11 is 135 kilo solutions (135,000) per second (KSol/s). At the same time, energy efficiency of the device reaches 10.50 joules per kilo solutions J/KSol. The miner is based on a 12-nanometer chip developed using Bare Die casting technology for the best heat dissipation. This allows for a decrease in the cost of electricity by 60 percent in comparison with the Antminer Z9.\n\nSold out in 20 minutes\nAccording to the manufacturer, the first batch of new miners was sold out just 20 minutes after the presale started, and some users believe this could be an orchestrated strategy designed to increase the price.\nIt is noteworthy that, even after the tag \u201cSold Out\u201d appeared, the price continued to increase. On the official forum, Zcash moderators raised an entire discussion to find out who managed to buy new ASICs and for how much. Users replied with numbers ranging from $1,048 to $1,366, and at the moment, Bitmain\u2019s website has the Antminer Z11 listed for $1,384.\nBuyers will receive their first devices between April 20 and 30, as stated on Bitmain\u2019s site. Despite the fact that the main sales are oriented to those who want to mine Zcash \u2014 the most liquid coin using the Equihash algorithm \u2014 it will be possible to use the Antminer Z11 to get other assets working on the same principle. According to WhatToMine, miners will be able to switch powers for mining coins such as Komodo (KMD), Zcash Classic (ZCL) or Horizen (ZEN), although the solution will not be as profitable.\nCommunity\u2019s reaction\nWhile some users are calculating the return generated by the new model and rejoicing at the coin\u2019s price growth, others are still concerned about the \u201cfact\u201d that the first batch sold out so quickly. Some suggest that this could be a specific group of people \u2014 or even a country \u2014 in whose hands the network\u2019s hash rate could now be concentrated. In general, in the community, as well as in the Zcash headquarters, few seem to be concerned about the potential threat from Bitmain.\nHowever, there are those who are worried about the possibility of centralization, and users are perplexed by the fact that, from their point of view, developers have been inactive.\n\u201cwhy do devs keep on with asics? earlier it was a disaster. what have changed? why noone doing nothing, while zcash being destroyed?\u201d\nSome users suggested a variety of solutions, including switching to proof-of-stake (PoS) and incorporating new modifications.\n\u201cMaybe devs should include a new attack vector, (mass) infected Asics ...\u201d\nThere are also users who refer to the recent hard fork Monero implemented on March 9 as part of the roadmap for preventing manipulations associated with ASIC miners.\nThis is the second time the Monero developers forked the network to fight new Antminers by Bitmain. The first fork was held on April 6, 2018 after the release of Antminer A3. At the same time, in both cases, immediately after the network upgrade, the network\u2019s hash rate fell by 80 percent.\n\nDespite the lack of drastic action on the part of Zcash developers, the team began to explore the potential and possible danger of new ASIC devices immediately after the release of Antminer Z9.\nOn May 8, 2018, Zcash CEO Josh Cincinnati announced a plan for prioritizing ASIC resistance, and he indicated that the team considered the implementation of these measures as one of the methods in combating ASIC hardware. One of the factors complicating such work, as stated by Cincinnati, was Wilcox\u2019s ambivalence to ASIC resistance. To decide which side to take on the issue of ASIC devices, users were offered a vote. The results showed that community members put other areas of the company's development above the fight against ASICs.\nHowever, Zcash creators announced the beginning of a study to examine the possibilities of new miners, as well as the development of a strategy to combat them.\nAmong the measures discussed were independent, consensus-compatible implementation of full-node software, and hiring developers to work on Zcash Improvement Proposals (ZIPs) in order to minimize the impact of such devices on the network.\nAnother ASIC resistance strategy appeared in the course of the annual grant program for Zcash developers. As a result, founders selected projects that offered a modification of the current Equihash algorithm or a transition to more ASIC-stable ProgPoW. In particular, one of the teams began to work on the transition to a more ASIC-resistant, but GPU-friendly ProgPoW algorithm.\nHow soon the results of such work will appear is so far unknown.\nPositive changes\nAfter the announcement of the Antminer Z11\u2019s release, ZEC\u2019s price surged from $49.03 by 5 percent in 24 hours and by 20 percent in 11 days.\n\nIn addition, over the past two weeks, the coin has appeared on new exchanges, and Binance has added new currencies paired with ZEC.\nSome of the users suggested that the coin owes its popularity to Bitmain and its high-performance ASICs.\nThe Zcash hashrate support is largely due to its ASIC is the most profitability miners among all.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nAfter the recent rally from the lows, one indicator has reached overbought levels last seen in Dec. 2017, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone. Historically, such overbought levels have resulted in multi-week downturns and McGlone expects one to start after the recent up-move.\nMany times, the signals provided by the indicators turn out to be false. More so at the bottom or the top because sentiment takes a long time to change. For the traders to become bullish after a prolonged bear phase is difficult. On numerous occasions, the first rally from the lows can reach overbought levels but this is not similar to the overbought levels as seen following an extended uptrend. Therefore, it is not a foregone conclusion that a similar outcome will follow.\nWhile a minor correction or a consolidation is possible, a retest of the yearly lows looks unlikely. More so, after a number of altcoins have risen way above their lows and look to have started a new uptrend. But, as there is a large overhang of supply at every higher level, the rise will be gradual, with intermittent dips.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) momentarily ascended above $5,300 but failed to sustain. However, it has been gradually moving up for the past four days even though the RSI is deeply overbought. This is a bullish sign. If the price does not correct within the next few days, the traders waiting to buy the dip will be forced to go long at higher levels or miss out on the opportunity. Hence, a rally to $5,900 looks plausible. The uptrending moving averages show that the bulls are firmly in command.\n\nOn the other hand, if the BTC/USD pair dips from the current levels, it might find support closer to $4,800 and below it at the 20-day EMA. If both these supports break, a fall to $4,255 is possible. This is a critical support and if it breaks, it will be a negative development and will indicate that the current move was only a rally in the bear market. However, looking at the charts, we give this a low probability of occurring.\nAs the RSI is deeply overbought, we anticipate a minor correction or a consolidation for a few days, after which the uptrend should continue. Traders can keep the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $4,400.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) broke out and closed (UTC time frame) above the overhead resistance at $167.32 on April 7. Thus, it completed an ascending triangle pattern that has a target objective of $251.64. However, there is stiff resistance at $220. Depending on the performance near the resistance, we might either suggest booking out of the complete position or trailing the stops very closely.\n\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the ETH/USD pair fails to hold the retest of the breakout levels of $167.32. In such a case, a drop to the 20-day EMA is probable, below which the fall can extend to the 50-day SMA. For now, the traders can retain the stop loss on the remaining long position at $150. We will trail the stops in a couple of days.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) has been trading in a tight range for the past two days. We like the way it has held up above $0.33108, however, the failure to push prices higher shows a lack of demand at higher levels.\n\nIf the overall sentiment turns negative, a drop to $0.33108 is probable. This is a critical support as the 20-day EMA is also located close by. If the XRP/USD pair rebounds from the support, it will indicate strength. On the other hand, if the pair plummets below the support, it can again correct to the critical support at $0.27795.\nContrary to our expectation, if the price scales above $0.37835, it is likely to pick up momentum and quickly move up to $0.45. We do not find any attractive risk to reward trade setups, hence, we are not recommending a trade in it yet.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) again broke out of the overhead resistance at $91 on April 6 and 7 but could not sustain. Currently, the price is back below $91. The bears will now try to drag the digital currency towards the 20-day EMA, which is a strong support.\n\nIf the LTC/USD pair bounces off the 20-day EMA or reverses direction from the current levels, it will try to break out and sustain above $100. If successful, it can result in a rally to $159 and above it to $180. As both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI remains in the overbought zone, the path of least resistance is to the upside.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below both the moving averages. In such a case, a large range bound action cannot be ruled out. We shall wait for the digital currency to bounce off a strong support before proposing a long position once again.\nBCH/USD\nAttempts to scale above $320 have failed to find buyers at higher levels. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently facing profit booking that can drag it towards $265. If this support breaks, a fall to $239 is probable. Both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, which shows that the bulls are in command.\n\nIf the $265 level holds, the BCH/USD pair will again try to move up toward the recent high of $363.30. Above this a rally to $400 and higher is probable. The pair has a history of vertical rallies, hence, traders can keep the stops on the remaining long positions at $230. We shall watch for a couple of days and raise the stops further. The trend will turn in favor of the bears on a breakdown and close (UTC time frame) below $239.\n\nEToro\u2019s Mati Greenspan breaks down markets recent market movements. Source: Cointelegraph\nEOS/USD\nEOS is finding it difficult to sustain above $5.50. It is likely to witness profit booking that can drag it down to the 20-day EMA. However, the uptrend is intact as both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone. If the digital currency rebounds from $5 or the 20-day EMA, it will again try to move up to its target objective of $6.8299.\n\nThe EOS/USD pair has a strong support at $4.4930. If this support breaks down, the trend will turn negative. If the support holds, the pair might remain range-bound between $4.4930 to $6.8299 for a few more days. The traders can keep the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $4.80.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) is not finding buying support above $20. Profit booking has dragged the price closer to the critical horizontal support. The 20-day EMA is also placed just below this support. Hence, we expect the bulls to defend it with strength. But if the 20-day EMA breaks down, a drop to the 50-day SMA is probable. Traders can retain the stop loss on the remaining long positions at just below 20-day EMA.\n\nConversely, if the BNB/USD pair rebounds from current levels, it will again attempt to scale above the $20\u2013$22 resistance zone. If successful, a retest of the lifetime highs is probable. As both the moving averages are still sloping up and the RSI is in positive territory, the trend remains up. The pair will turn negative on a breakdown below $14.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) continues to face selling close to the resistance line. This shows that the bears are active at higher levels. However, with both the moving averages sloping up and the RSI close to the overbought zone, we anticipate the bulls to again attempt to break out of the resistance line.\n\nThe first level to watch on the upside is $0.14861760. The long-term downtrend line is also located close to this level; hence, this is likely to act as a major roadblock. If the XLM/USD pair sustains above the downtrend line, it will indicate a probable change in trend.\nOur bullish assumption will be negated if the pair slides below the 20-day EMA. This might be followed by a drop to the 50-day SMA. The traders can trail the stop loss on the remaining long position to $0.1130.\nADA/USD\nCardano (ADA) is struggling to break out of $0.094256. The failure to scale the overhead resistance is likely to attract profit booking. The first support on the downside is at $0.082952 and below it at the 20-day EMA. We expect one of these support levels to hold up.\n", "birthday": "2019-04-08T20:10:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-08 19:10:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 8}

Credit photo: INATBA\nLaunching ceremony\nHosted by European Commissioner Mariya Gabriel and EC Director-General Roberto Viola, the ceremony began with the hashing of the association\u2019s charter to a variety of blockchains, including Iota's (one of many crypto-focused members of the association, in addition to Ripple, ConsenSys and the Sovrin Foundation).\nIt was then followed by a keynote speech given by Gabriel, who stressed not only the EU\u2019s commitment to fostering the development of blockchain technology, but also the importance of blockchain in providing trust in an increasingly complex economy.\n\u201cIn today\u2019s economy, there is less and less time to build trust in the way it happened in the past. To fight cancer, to balance renewable energy, to trace the authenticity of goods, actors must be able to trust one another without meeting face-to-face. And how can we achieve this? Of course, with the help of blockchain.\u201d\n\nChief principles\nBut in order to arrive at a world where blockchain-based platforms bridge the trust gap, more needs to be done to encourage the development of viable platforms, as well as the their standardization. This is precisely where INATBA enters the picture. It will aim to foster a legislative and regulative environment within Europe in which distributed ledger technology (DLT) can spread and evolve. As such, its declaration comprises four chief principles intended to support this objective, as outlined on its\u00a0website:\n\"Maintain a permanent and constructive dialogue with public authorities and regulators that will contribute to the convergence of regulatory approaches to blockchain and other distributed ledger technology globally.\u201d\u201cPromote an open, transparent and inclusive global model of governance for blockchain and other distributed ledger technology infrastructures that reflects the shared interests of stakeholders from industry, start-ups and SMEs, civil society organisations, governments and international organisations.\u201d\u201cSupport the development and adoption of interoperability guidelines, specifications and global standards, to enhance trusted, traceable, user-centric digital services.\u201d\u201cDevelop sector-specific guidelines and specifications for the development and acceleration of trusted sectorial blockchain and DLT applications in specific sectors.\"\nAs a whole, these goals have the overarching end of creating as much of a uniform framework for the development and deployment of blockchain technology as possible. By ensuring that standards converge throughout the EU and beyond, startups and organizations will benefit from greater certainty and clarity when pursuing DLT-related projects, something that could prove vital in encouraging greater adoption of blockchain.\n\"Developing a regulatory framework around distributed ledger and blockchain technologies is essential to their widespread adoption and growth,\" said Dominik Schiener, a co-founder and co-chair of the Iota Foundation.\n\"The strength and size of this association, as well as the support of the European Commission and other governments, only further shows the future limitless potential for Distributed Ledger Technologies.\"\nBlockchain\u2019s potential\nThe signing was followed by a panel discussion, which delved more deeply into this potential. Moderated by Gerard de Graaf \u2014 the EC's Directorate\u2011General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT) \u2014 it saw representatives from the United Nations, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and other organizations explore some of the ways they expect blockchain technology to help with their particular areas of operation.\n\u201cIn the specific case of climate change, blockchain is relevant not only for mitigation, but also for adaption,\u201d explained Massamba Thioye, the manager of the Sustainable Development Mechanism at the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\u201cFor adaption, it can help enhance the resilience of supply chains, and this is extremely important. On mitigation, it opens a completely new area of action, particularly in the context of measurement of impact of climate action.\u201d\nThioye wasn\u2019t the only member of the panel to champion blockchain\u2019s potential, with the U.N. World Food Program\u2019s (WFP) Bernhard Kowatsch also talking approvingly of the WFP\u2019s Building Blocks program for refugees in Jordan.\nHowever, even if there was general agreement on blockchain\u2019s potential, there were few concrete details on how exactly INATBA will achieve its aims of cultivating greater interoperability and standards. That said, there was, unsurprisingly, strong agreement that tackling the issues of interoperability, standardization and regulation is absolutely key if blockchain is to thrive, with a subsequent panel featuring INATBA board members acknowledging these issues directly.\n\u201cSome of the things that I think INATBA can help with is stopping the multiple proliferation and divergence of standards across different organizations in multiple jurisdictions,\u201d said Paco Garcia of digital identity platform Yoti.\n\u201cI think INATBA can be that kind of force of convergence. Not only on a technology level, but also across different sectors vertically.\u201d\nINATBA membership\nINATBA is currently inviting other organizations interested in joining it to apply for membership, while Paco Garcia noted during the final panel that 48 additional organizations had applied for membership on the day of the association\u2019s launch. This interest is encouraging, because \u2014 as Iota\u2019s Julie Maupin noted during her contributions to the panel \u2014 the cooperative launch of INATBA compares starkly to \u201cwhere we were a few years ago, where you couldn\u2019t sit in a room with competitors in the space without people behaving badly.\u201d\nIt\u2019s for this kind of reason that the signing of INATBA's charter stands as an important milestone in the blockchain industry's evolution. Up until now, many companies and industries have flirted with the idea of integrating some kind of DLT, but it's only now that an international organization with government backing has been formed in order to create a standardized context for the implementation of blockchain technologies. Given that blockchain generally operates in a way that transcends national boundaries, the EU's involvement in the association is pivotal, since it will provide companies and organizations with the assurance that their use of blockchain will comply with relevant standards and regulations, irrespective of location.\nRecent surveys have shown that companies have drawn away from blockchain adoption as a result of the lack of regulatory certainty. In June, a\u00a0survey from EY found that \"regulatory complexity is the greatest barrier to widespread blockchain adoption,\" with 61% of \"senior professionals\" from a variety of industries identifying this as the biggest stumbling block. Similarly, a\u00a0September study from Deloitte also concluded that regulatory problems \"are another major barrier to blockchain adoption,\" in addition to a \"lack of standards and interoperability between various blockchain platforms and solutions.\"", "birthday": "2019-04-09T13:35:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-09 12:35:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 9}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/smart-cities-offer-promises-and-concerns-over-privacy", "title": " Smart Cities Offer Promises and Concerns Over Privacy ", "content": "The promise is great for so-called smart cities, which will deploy a network of interactive sensors to achieve efficiency and innovation. The smart city vision includes driverless cars, renewable energy to aid a city\u2019s power consumption, energy-efficient buildings, and communications\u00a0systems that work with the location\u2019s infrastructure to avoid waste, among other features. \u00a0\nA report by the International Data Corporation (IDC) indicates that spending on smart city technology is expected to grow to $135 billion by 2021.\nDespite the promise of a futuristic and more environmentally friendly city, the results \u2014 at least so far \u2014 are not vast. Politicians talk about future benefits while special interest committees are formed and plans are made. Still, little progress seems to be made toward actually implementing most of the programs or setting a timetable for deployment.\nThat may be changing. Google is creating a smart city in Toronto, and, with the vast resources of the technology giant, the first widespread implementation of the promises of smart cities may be at hand. But there are still concerns over certain aspects of implementing the smart cities program.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appeared at the October 2017 kickoff for the smart city being designed by Google for Toronto. \u201cWe know the world is changing,\u201d said Trudeau, as he stood alongside senior Google executive Eric Schmidt. \u201cThe choice we have is to either resist it and be frightened by it, or to say we can step up and shape it.\u201d\nGoogle\u2019s aim in Toronto is to address common urban problems like congestion, inefficient services, and unaffordable housing on 12-acres of waterfront land. But already, there are concerns being raised about the project. Many reports have surfaced concerning privacy for the residents of the new city, who will be constantly recorded in their activities.\nCompact hidden cameras would take low-resolution pictures of inhabitants and visitors, as well as automobiles on the streets. The smart city pledges to use the \u201cfeedback of residents\u201d to plan and adapt services. But the project has upset many people, including local technologists, property developers, politicians from both sides of the aisle, urbanists, academics, privacy experts, business leaders and the Canadian Civil Liberties Union. \u00a0\nAre we being over-promised?\nPrime Minister Trudeau said at the press conference announcing Google\u2019s smart city project that Toronto would serve as a model for Canada and the globe.\nOne analyst agreed that the promise of smart cities may be oversold. But, he added, that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. \u201cOf course, but that\u2019s nothing new,\u201d said Peter Hirshberg, co-founder of co-working space Maker City and chairman of Swytch, a blockchain-based platform that tracks and verifies the impact of sustainability efforts and actions on the worldwide level of CO2 emissions.\n\u201cCities have always been home to our greatest aspirations and visions of utopia. The 1939 World\u2019s Fair/urban renewal/post-war cities promised a utopian city of tomorrow with no blight and smooth traffic. Instead, we got suburbs, too many cars, traffic, white flight and lack of sustainability. The modern urban movement of the 1990s promised a creative class and revived urban centers built on the principle that denser cities were smarter and open innovation worked better than suburban office parks.\u201d\nPrivacy might be a thing of the past in a world of smart cities\nAs with Toronto\u2019s concerns, how to safeguard privacy and data collected in a smart city is a major question that still needs to be answered. The data gathered by a municipality must be largely anonymous in urban environments.\nJeffrey Blessing, a professor and director at the Milwaukee School of Engineering, sees other reasons to be wary. \u201cI\u2019m concerned with the cybersecurity implications of the smart city,\u201d Blessing told Cointelegraph.\nThe devices and services we use in a metropolitan setting must be data secure, he says. This is necessary to gain the public\u2019s trust. And, in order to achieve this, it seems clear that companies that compete will have to collaborate in order to truly benefit.\n\u201cComputer networks are an excellent example of this; standards are set so that devices cooperate and communicate, but compete on the implementation of services,\u201d Blessing said.\nHe also believes that companies will have to provide both simple user experiences and privacy safeguards.\n\u201cWhen it comes to users adopting and accepting new technology, convenience and ease-of-use is key,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, security is often inconvenient and gates with guards must be placed around valuable data and info.\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cWe\u2019ve all heard horror stories of hacking, cyber break-ins and loss of data from all types of institutions, public and private, large and small. Technological innovation in a public setting is always challenging, because there are contradictory forces at work.\u201d\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) serves as an example of Blessing\u2019s points:\n\u201cFrom a cybersecurity perspective, AI technology is in the hands of both the good guys (white hats) and the bad guys (black hats). Companies are continuously collecting data about us from our cell phones, smart speakers, ubiquitous cameras, etc. and using AI to learn about our habits, objectives, and intentions through machine learning. While we should not be paranoid about big brother, we need public officials to demand transparency and accountability from technology companies that are trying to profit from personal data that is collected via smart city initiatives.\u201d\nBlockchain and crypto technologies in a smart city\nIn a smart city\u2019s environment, there will need to be a system in place that allows the devices that are attempting to monetize certain activities to verify a large number of transactions and quickly confirm their authenticity.\nThat\u2019s where blockchain and DLT could have a role. But there are limitations with the current state of the technology. The ability to scale to service millions of daily transactions is one, with another being the speed of verifying transactions and potentially high transaction fees.\nThe problem is somewhat endemic to the current state of DLT and blockchain. That\u2019s because transactions using DLT and blockchain need to be verified by the operators of nodes along the chains, who are then rewarded with a digital coin for their trouble.\nThis can result in a network that takes a long time to verify things when the volume gets high, with transaction fees rising to incentivize transaction confirmations. That makes it currently impractical for use in most large-scale situations.\nHowever, there are many companies trying to solve these problems for enterprise clients. R3\u2019s Corda, which has created a blockchain-based platform inspired by the Bitcoin blockchain, is working with enterprise clients on such projects. IBM and Samsung are developing an architecture for blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT), and IOTA\u2019s Tangle is heavily involved in the sector.", "birthday": "2019-04-09T10:45:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-09 09:45:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 9}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nGoogle searches for Bitcoin tripled as its price skyrocketed on Apr. 02. This shows that interest in cryptocurrencies is still high. If prices recover, a large number of traders sitting on the sidelines will jump onto the crypto bandwagon.\nThough the rebound is a bullish sign, for it to be sustainable, Bitcoin needs to gain a wider adoption in day to day transactions. Andreas Antonopoulos, Bitcoin educator and entrepreneur, believes that the next generation of use cases will highlight the need of Bitcoin to the average customer. Bitcoin is currently limited only to the tech-savvy users due to the difficulty in transaction and storage. But with advances, it is likely to reach the masses that will increase its popularity.\nIn a report, software startup DataLight said that if Bitcoin continues to grow exponentially, the way it has in the past decade, then it will surpass the current leaders Visa, Master Card, and pay pal. While fundamentals determine the price in the long-term, short-term price is influenced by sentiment. Let\u2019s analyze it with the help of charts. \u00a0\nBTC/USD\nWe had been projecting a target objective of $5,273.91 on Bitcoin (BTC) for the past few days and on Apr. 02, it hit an intraday high of $5,273.35. However, the higher levels saw profit booking that dragged the price back towards the support of $4,914.11. On the downside, $4,775 provided support, which is a positive sign. This shows that the bulls are in no great urgency to book profits.\n\nThe BTC/USD pair is again attempting to resume the up move. If it scales above $5,273.35, a quick rally to $5,674 and above it to $5,900 is possible. Therefore, we had recommended to book only partial profits in our previous analysis. However, with the RSI deep in the overbought territory, the pair might spend some more time in consolidation close to the current levels.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency turns down from the current levels and slides below $4,500. Therefore, traders can raise the stops on the remaining long positions to $4,400.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) could not close (UTC time frame) above $167.32 on Apr. 03. This shows selling at higher levels. However, the pullback found support close to $150 levels. \u00a0\n\nCurrently, the bulls are again attempting to scale above the resistance of $167.32. If successful, the ETH/USD pair will complete a bullish ascending triangle pattern that has a target objective of $251.64.\nContrary to our assumption, if the digital currency reverses direction from the current levels and plummets below $144.78, it can fall to the trendline of the ascending triangle. Traders can trail the stop loss on the remaining long position to $150.\nXRP/USD\nAs expected, Ripple (XRP) pulled back to the breakout level on Apr. 02 and 03, which held. This is a positive sign. Currently, the price has bounced off the support and is on its way towards the first target objective of $0.40.\n\nIf the price sustains above the resistance line of the channel, it will signal the end of the downtrend. In the medium-term, the XRP/USD pair is likely to reach $0.60. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair slumps back below $0.33108. It will indicate a lack of demand at higher levels. We shall wait for the price to sustain above the channel for a couple of days before recommending any long positions.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) broke out of the overhead resistance at $91 on Apr. 03 but faced profit booking close to $100 levels. We expect $91 to act as a stiff resistance. The RSI had risen deep into the overbought territory, hence, we had proposed traders close their complete long positions in the previous analysis.\n\nThe pullback in the LTC/USD pair took support at $80.4193 and is currently again trying to breakout of $91. If the pair breaks out and sustains above $91, it will be on target to reach $159. Nevertheless, if the bears defend the overhead resistance, a fall to $77 is probable. We shall wait for another buy setup to form before suggesting long positions once again.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) soared to $363.30 level on Apr. 03, coming close to our target objective of $400. But higher levels attracted profit booking and the digital currency has given up some of its recent gains since then.\n\nAfter rallying 117.57 percent in two days, the BCH/USD pair might consolidate or correct for a few days before attempting to rise to $400 once again. Support on the downside is at $265.14 and $241.97, being 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the recent rally.\nIf the bears sink the price below $239, a fall to $208.99 and below it a full 100 percent retracement to $166.98 is probable. Therefore, traders can trail the stop loss on the remaining long positions to $230.\nEOS/USD\nEOS reached our target objective of $5.8370 on Apr. 03 but it could not sustain the higher levels. The ensuing pullback found support at $4.90. Currently, the bulls are again attempting to push the price back above $6 and towards the next target objective of $6.8299. The moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, which shows that the bulls are in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nOn the downside, any pullback might find support close to $4.4930, which is the previous resistance turned support. The 20-day EMA is also located just below this level. Hence, we expect the buyers to defend this level with force. If the level holds, the EOS/USD pair might remain range bound between $4.49 to $6.8299 for a few more days. But if this level breaks, it will indicate weakness. Traders can trail the stops on the remaining long positions to $4.8. We suggest tightening the stop loss to protect our paper profits.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) is consolidating above $18 for the past two days, which is a positive sign. After the range expansion on Apr. 02, the range has shrunk for the past two days. The digital currency is taking a break after its stupendous run in the past few days.\nIf the bulls scale above the overhead resistance at $22, a retest of the lifetime highs at $26.4732350 will be on the cards. The digital currency remains in a strong uptrend with both the moving averages sloping up and the RSI close to the overbought levels. Traders can continue to trail the stops on the remaining long positions to just below the 20-day EMA.\n\nThe BNB/USD pair is currently trading inside the ascending channel. A breakdown of the channel and the 20-day EMA will be the first indication that the momentum is losing steam. A break below Apr. 02 intraday low of $15.5624721 can attract further selling and drag the price to the 50-day SMA. If this level also breaks, the trend will turn in favor of the bears.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) is struggling to scale above the resistance line. The price turned down from the resistance on Apr. 03 but found support just above the 20-day EMA. Traders would have closed partial long positions as suggested in our previous analysis.\n\nIf the bulls succeed in breaking out of the overhead resistance, a rally to $0.14861760 is probable. This might act as a stiff resistance because the long-term downtrend line is also located just above this level. On the downside, the 20-day EMA will act as a strong support. Both the moving averages are trending up gradually and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. This shows that the bulls are in command. If the XLM/USD pair scales above the downtrend line, it might signal the end of this downtrend. Traders can keep the stops on the remaining position at breakeven.\nADA/USD\nCardano (ADA) witnessed profit booking above $0.094256 levels on Mar. 03, It fell to $0.081791 on the next day but quickly bounced back, which shows buying on dips. Currently, the bulls are attempting to push the digital currency above the overhead resistance once again.\nIf successful, a rally to $0.112598 is probable. Above this level, there is no major resistance until $0.20. We suggest traders trail the stop loss on the remaining long positions to $0.080.", "birthday": "2019-04-05T20:49:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-05 19:49:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 5}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nThe surge in Bitcoin on April 2 pulled most altcoins northwards. A number of altcoins soared, bringing back memories of the 2017 bull phase. Many altcoins outperformed Bitcoin, which shows that the market participants are accumulating the select beaten down cryptocurrencies at low prices.\nDoes this mark the end of the bear phase and the start of a new uptrend in cryptocurrencies? \u00a0Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Thomas Lee certainly believes so. According to him, Bitcoin is now in a bull market. He said that the whales, some of whom had sold in 2018, have started to buy again.\nIn a tweet, the CME group revealed that Bitcoin futures hit a record volume of 22,500 contracts on April 4. The previous record volume was 18,300 contracts, which occurred on Feb. 19. This shows that shorts were forced to throw in the towel and aggressive bulls entered long positions.\nThe sharp rally from the bottom is a positive sign that indicates demand at lower levels. However, to confirm a bottom, most digital currencies will have to successfully retest the breakout levels and then resume their recovery. Until then, the risk of a double dip remains. We shall get a confirmation within the next few weeks.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) turned out to be the best performer among the major cryptocurrencies in the past seven days. The digital currency tends to rise vertically when the sentiment of the sector turns bullish. Recently, Crypto Facilities, a subsidiary of the San Francisco-based exchange Kraken, reported a sharp increase in Bitcoin Cash futures. The travel portal Bitcoin.Travel added support for Bitcoin Cash, bringing the total number of cryptocurrencies accepted to seven. Can the rally continue or will the digital currency again plunge towards the lows? Let us find out.\n\nThe BCH/USD pair traded in a tight weekly range for 11 weeks before skyrocketing higher. The sharp up-move has carried the pair above the 20-week EMA for the first time since May of last year. While the sharp up-move is a positive sign, failure to close (UTC time frame) the week with strength shows profit booking at higher levels.\nThis increases the probability of a minor consolidation or correction for the next couple of weeks as the bears try to reverse direction and sink the price back below $200 levels. However, if the price rebounds from the support zone of $265.14 to $241.97, a rally towards the 50-week SMA at $514 is possible in the medium-term. \u00a0\nLTC/USD\nEven before the crypto rally began across the board, Litecoin (LTC) had increased about 101.22 percent in the first quarter, which shows that the traders had been gradually accumulating the cryptocurrency. The halving, expected to occur in early August, has also supported the rise. Swedish exchange Nordic Growth Market has listed exchange-traded products that track the value of Ripple and Litecoin, and these products will be available to European investors. Can the virtual currency continue its stellar run or will it hit a roadblock? Let us find out.\n\nThe LTC/USD pair has formed a rounding bottom pattern that will close on a breakout and weekly close above $91. The price has risen above both the moving averages, which is a bullish sign: it indicates a likely change in trend. The minimum target objective of the rounding bottom is $159. If this level is crossed, the rally can extend to the next critical resistance of $175.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the bears defend the overhead resistance at $91. In such a case, a few weeks of consolidation cannot be ruled out. The trend will turn in favor of the bears if the prices sink below $62 once again.\nDash/USD\nDash (DASH) has made strong inroads in the crisis that hit Venezuela and is now attempting to increase its presence in Columbia. Latin American cryptocurrency exchange Daexs has added Dash, which will help investors buy the digital currency in the Colombian peso. Dash is slowly expanding its presence in Thailand as well, as about 100 Dash online transactions were recorded in March. The team is also trying to enter countries like Zimbabwe and Turkey where hyperinflation has increased the use case for cryptocurrencies. Let\u2019s see how the market views these events.\n\nAfter trading in a tight range of $56.214 to $103.261 for 16 weeks, the DASH/USD pair broke out and closed (UTC time frame) above the range in the previous week. It has followed it up with a sharp up move this week. The pair has broken out of the 20-week EMA and is on target to reach the 50-week SMA at $176. Above this, the recovery can stretch to $224.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency turns down from the current levels and plummets below $103.261. In such a case, a few more days of range bound action is possible.\nNEO/USD\nNEO rallied over 31 percent in the past seven days to emerge as the fourth-best performer among the major coins. There were no major events that caused the rise: every rally need not be preceded by a piece of news. In a bear market, the fundamental developments and the price appreciation happens with a lag.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/luck-of-the-draw-new-binance-launchpad-lottery-structure-divides-critics", "title": " Luck of the Draw: New Binance Launchpad Lottery Structure Divides Critics ", "content": "Despite the changing attitude toward altcoins and initial coin offerings (ICO) on the whole, Launchpad \u2014 the token offering platform developed by the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance \u2014 is selling out of its offerings in a matter of minutes. With the firm now concluding a series of sold-out token launches, the company divided opinions when it announced changes to the structure of its platform. Cointelegraph takes a look at the changes to the service, along with the latest Binance token offering news and developments.\nBinance Launchpad changes format\nOn March 24, prominent cryptocurrency exchange Binance published a post laying out fundamental changes to the structure of its Launchpad token sale platform.\nThe company had previously used a first-come, first-served system that resulted in long waiting lists and some investors missing out on tokens. According to the press release, the company will now use a lottery-style format for its future token sales on Launchpad.\nAs per the press release, the new system will focus around a lottery ticket initiative in which service users will be able to claim a maximum of five tickets by holding a certain amount of Binance Coin (BNB) over the 20-day period preceding the lottery. Users are allocated one ticket per 100 BNB held, up until the maximum of five tickets is reached. The minimum amount of 100 BNB necessary to take part in the lottery currently sets the investment threshold at $1,700. According to the company, users will be able to choose how many tickets they want to enter into the lottery 24 hours before the winners are selected. The maximum number is chosen based on their BNB holdings over the 20 day period prior to the lottery event.\nIt appears that the change in format stems from a multitude of factors, varying from customer demand to efforts to make the process more fair. Although the company did not specify what specific demands customers had requested, or whether or not they were experiencing a change in clientele, a spokesperson for Binance Launchpad spoke to Cointelegraph about the rationale behind the changes:\n\u201cIn a fast-changing world, we listen, learn and adapt. We created a new lottery format for Binance Launchpad because we are prioritizing for fairness, transparency and a better user experience.\u201d\nDespite increased investor skepticism of the usefulness of ICOs in general, Binance claims to be experiencing an increase in its token sale participants, citing figures released by founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao (aka CZ):\n\u201cif you look at the number of participants CZ has publicly announced on his Twitter, the demand is actually growing for Launchpad with each session. For example, 39,003 people participated in the recent Launchpad token sale, whereas only 19,860 people participated in the token sale prior.\u201d\nAlthough the figures appear to suggest that Binance\u2019s appeal for ICOs is undimmed, the changes to Launchpad\u2019s format drew sharp criticism from members of the crypto community, with many saying that the changes would price out small investors. Investors and crypto enthusiasts alike took to Twitter to voice their concerns over what implications the new format could have:\nUpdate to the #Binance Launchpad Token Sale Formathttps://t.co/rDU7SvspXM\u2014 Binance (@binance) March 24, 2019\n\nI think I will no more participate in #TokenSales on Binance Launchpad, unless Binance remove the new rules.\u2014 @cryptospa [Accumulating STEEM] (@cryptospa1) March 24, 2019\n\nOne complain tho, minimum BNB holding balance is about worth $1500 and tbvh @cz_binance ,that's more than entrie portfolio of 75% of people in crypto.\u2014 Ravi (@hodlorr) March 24, 2019\n\nAs it became clear that the new format was experiencing a mixed reception at best, CZ engaged with a number of Twitter users to try to gauge what might be more palatable to the widest range of potential investors:\nWill address some of the questions/concerns/feedback in this thread.Our new Launchpad model is not set in stone. It\u2019s the result of multiple detailed discussions over the weekend, while considering all angles. We will consider suggestions and will make certain tweaks. https://t.co/2wfeyZUyZH\u2014 CZ Binance (@cz_binance) March 24, 2019\n\nIn the thread, CZ addressed the most commonly mentioned issues and suggestions, stating that the \u201cLaunchpad model is not set in stone. It\u2019s the result of multiple detailed discussions over the weekend, while considering all angles. We will consider suggestions and will make certain tweaks.\u201d\nThe main concerns fall into two categories. The first issue that critics were swift to point out is that the proposed system appeared to favor \u201cwhales\u201d \u2014 i.e. individuals or entities that hold a large number of cryptocurrency \u2014 and was in danger of pricing out smaller investors unable to hold 100 BNB. CZ pointed out that, while it would be possible to lower the threshold, this would consequently reduce the percentage chance of winning and could result in dissatisfaction with the service. Many critics suggested a \u201cmagic number\u201d of 50 BNB. While CZ admitted that the threshold could potentially be a mistake, he did stress that the core demand remained very high for Launchpad and that limiting the minimum amount does not represent a quick solution to the problem.\nThe second issue concerned whales creating several accounts in order to gain additional tickets, thereby maximizing their chances of being selected. In addition to information in the press release stating that all due diligence and Know Your Customer (KYC) measures would still apply as usual, CZ stated that all measures to prevent this from happening were both strong and already in place:\nFeedback 2, whales creating more accountsThere is strong KYC and anti-fake KYC measures in place already, which we think should be adequate to address the problem.\u2014 CZ Binance (@cz_binance) March 24, 2019\n\nThe CEO also made sure to point out that people should only take part in Launchpad token sales if they are in a financially stable position and can factor in the losses that they may potentially suffer. Likewise, in the press release announcing the changes published on March 24, the company stated that entry into the lottery does not guarantee winning and that fluctuations of BNB\u2019s price were likely:\n\u201cBNB price will fluctuate during the 20 day period. If BNB price drops, it is entirely possible the drop in BNB price will outweigh any gains made by the new token. That is first assuming you win in the lottery draw. Further, the new token being sold is not guaranteed to increase in price. It may drop in price. There are significant risks. You are responsible for your own decisions.\u201d\nWhen Cointelegraph questioned a spokesperson for Binance Launchpad about whether the platform was experiencing a shift toward larger investors, the company declined to comment but gave a short response regarding criticism of the new format:\n\u201cAs CZ tweeted recently about Launchpad, we take suggestions into careful consideration, and will make certain adjustments based on the feedback we receive.\u201d\nRecent coin launches\nIn recent months Binance Launchpad completed a number of high-profile token sales. Demand is clearly high for coin launches, with many of the token sales completed in a matter of minutes. Most recently, the company completed a $4 million sale of Celer Network (CELR) tokens. Celer Network is a layer-2 scaling platform that works to enable off-chain transactions for payment transactions and off-chain smart contracts.\nAll 597,014,925 CELR tokens were sold in a single session that lasted 17 minutes and 35 seconds. As with previous token sales, Binance only accepts payment via BNB. At press time, each CELR token is worth 0.001051 BNB, equating to $0.020181.\nOn Feb. 25, Binance Launchpad completed the sale of Fetch.AI (FET) tokens, reaching a total of $6 million, with over 69 million tokens sold. According to a tweet published by CZ, the sale was completed in just 22 seconds.\nFetch.AI is a project that seeks to establish an \u201ceconomic internet\u201d by combining machine learning, multi-agent systems, intelligent smart contracts, distributed ledger technology and artificial intelligence. \u00a0FET\u2019s initial coin offering was set to close once the $6 million hard cap was reached or on March 3. According to a tweet published by CZ, the sale was oversubscribed, leading to a bottleneck on the exchange:\n\u201c24000 people pre-signed the User Agreement, 19860 people successfully submitted a buy order, 2758 people got a piece. The first 22 seconds.\u201d\nAs per a Binance blog post published on Feb. 25, the tokens were, in fact, sold to participants in less than 11 minutes and 14 seconds. The extension in the initially reported time is allegedly the result of taking into account the processing time for submitted buy orders.\nAt the time of the launch, 1 FET token was sold at 0.00858400 BNB, equating to $0.0818, at a BNB-USD exchange rate of $9.53, as of Feb. 26. Participant token purchases were capped at $3,000, with a minimum investment threshold of $20.\nBinance also concluded the sale of Tron-based BitTorrent token (BTT) on Jan. 28, bringing in a total of $7.1 million dollars and a total sale of 50 billion tokens in less than 15 minutes. BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file-sharing platform that allows service users to share files such as music or videos via the internet.\nUnlike the sale of the FET and CELR tokens, the BTT launch consisted of two simultaneous sessions, with one for buyers purchasing with BNB and another for buyers using Tron (TRX). According to information posted on the Binance website, each token was priced at $0.00012 at press time. \u00a0\nTron CEO and founder Justin Sun confirmed the successful sale of the tokens in a tweet after the launch had been completed:\n\u201cIt is official: In the BNB session, all 23.76 billion BTT were sold to token sale participants within 13 minutes and 25 seconds. Meanwhile, in the Tron session, all 35.64 billion BTT were sold within 14 minutes and 41 seconds.\u201d\nDespite the success of the sale and its seemingly short duration, CZ tweeted that the launch could have concluded much faster were it not for some unexpected technical issues relating to the sheer level of demand for the product:\n\u201cBoth sessions concluded. Took about 18 minutes, due to a system issue, would have taken 18 seconds otherwise. Demand was astronomical.\u201d\nHuobi launches rival platform\nWith several lucrative ICOs under its belt, Binance Launchpad\u2019s success has not gone unnoticed. Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global announced on March 20 the launch of its own platform for prerelease token sales in a blog post.\nThe platform, officially named Huobi Prime, will give investors the change to access new altcoins before they appear publicly on the most prominent exchanges. The services will be powered by Huobi Token. According to Leon Li, founder and CEO of Huobi Group, the new service stems from customer demand and has been designed \u201cfrom the ground up to be a more innovative, direct and responsive way to access up and coming new tokens.\u201d\nAccording to information published in the Medium post, all coins purchased through Huobi Prime are immediately deposited into users accounts. The company also states that a \u201crigorous screening and selection process\u201d has been put in place, citing the importance of a progressive business model, financial backing, community support, reputation, technical innovation and expertise in aspiring projects.\nListings on Huobi Prime were initially set to involve three 30-minute rounds of coin offerings, however, the company announced \u00a0a change to 5-minute rounds of active trading with 5-minute breaks in an April 3 press release. The first two rounds will have a similar structure in that a certain amount of discounted tokens will be made available to users on a first-come, first served basis.The ratio will be 20 percent of total supply in the first round and 30 percent in the second. The biggest shake up to the existing structure is the allocation of the remaining 50 percent of discounted tokens in the third round. The company explains in the press release that this will benefit users who have not reached their cap in the preceding rounds:\n\u201cUsers who have not exhausted their personal cap and place limit buy orders in the third round will receive at least some portion of the tokens they ordered via adjusted system matching. Orders must be placed at the highest buy price in order to be filled partially and the amount filled will be positively correlated to the size of the order.\u201d", "birthday": "2019-04-07T11:05:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-07 10:05:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 7}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/free-money-how-students-mine-cryptocurrency-in-their-dorm-rooms", "title": " \u2018Free\u2019 Money: How Students Mine Cryptocurrency in Their Dorm Rooms ", "content": "Last month, reports surfaced on crypto mining research conducted by tech conglomerate Cisco with the following headline: \u201cCollege kids are using campus electricity to mine crypto.\u201d\nIndeed, many students don\u2019t have to worry about paying power bills, as per their university housing contracts, which tend to cover electricity expenses. That \u201cfree\u201d power allows them to host cost-efficient mining rigs, where the only expense is the actual hardware. It almost seems too good to be true: Mining students receive a passive income, which can potentially cover the purchase of a few textbooks \u2014 or even pay for the whole semester and more.\nHowever, there\u2019s a catch: No electricity is actually free, and someone ultimately has to pay the price.\nHow popular is mining among students?\nCisco\u2019s security researchers investigated cryptocurrency mining activity across various industry verticals. The research was carried out with the company\u2019s cloud security platform Umbrella, which monitors clients\u2019 network connections to screen malicious activity, allegedly revealing incidents of crypto mining.\nAccording to the findings, university campuses are the second-biggest miners of virtual currency across industry verticals at 22 percent, second only to the energy and utilities sector, with about 34 percent.\nAs Cointelegraph reported, miner revenues began to wane in 2018 (the last full year for statistics), thanks to the crypto winter and its attendant price drop. That made mining less profitable. But hash rates have continued to increase, indicating that the global mining pool continues to grow, even as individual miners come and go.\nCisco threat researcher Austin McBride explained the trend to PCMag, saying that \"you leave [the mining rig] running in your dorm room for four years, you walk out of college with a big chunk of change.\"\nWhile running mining rigs in dorm rooms, students purportedly avoid electricity costs associated with cryptocurrency mining profitability, said McBride, adding:\n\"Mining difficulty for a lot of coins is very high right now \u2014 which means it costs more for electricity and internet than the profit you can produce from mining those coins. If you don't have to pay for those costs, then you are in a really good spot for making money on the university's dime.\"\nCointelegraph reached out to Cisco and Cisco Umbrella to clarify which campuses were monitored, but has yet to receive a response. \u00a0\nA similar report was conducted earlier in March 2018, when cyber attack monitoring firm Vectra found out that both intentional cryptocurrency mining and cryptojacking was becoming more prevalent on college campuses than in any other industry.\nAs per Vectra, universities are not able to monitor their networks as closely as large corporations with high-budget IT departments, \u201cat best [advising] students on how to protect themselves and the university by installing operating system patches and creating awareness of phishing emails, suspicious websites and web ads.\u201d\nStudents who take advantage of this \u201cfree power,\u201d in turn, are \u201csimply being opportunistic as the value of cryptocurrencies surged over the past year,\u201d Vectra\u2019s blog post stated. Matt Walmsley, Europe, Middle East and Africa director at Vectra, told Cointelegraph that, while the scope of their research was international, he cannot disclose which universities participated in the study:\n\u201cThe data was provided by from education establishments around the world on the understanding that any identifying information would remain anonymous.\u201d\nTherefore, while it is difficult to pinpoint the hot spots for college virtual currency mining on the map, the phenomenon seems to be quite popular overall. According to the 2019 Vectra report issued earlier this year, \u201ccryptocurrency mining has surged in popularity with students and criminals, particularly among universities with large student populations.\u201d\nIs it really that simple?\nOne of the main things about mining in university housing conditions is that it has to be discreet \u2014 otherwise, the wardens might hear the noise and start investigating. Mark D\u2019Aria, founder and CEO of Bitpro, a New York-based installation and mining operation management firm, told Cointelegraph:\n\u201cI suspect the vast majority of mining from college campuses isn't from what you would think of as mining \u2018rigs\u2019 \u2014 those giant machines with multiple GPUs [graphics processing units], purpose built for mining. ASICs [application-specific integrated circuits] are also certainly going to be extremely rare simply because they're so loud and hot that no one is going to tolerate them in their dorm room for very long. The student is going to need to explain that, and he's not going to get away with it for long.\u201d\nInstead, most of the mining seems to be coming from students' old-fashioned PCs, the Bitpro CEO suggested. Notably, casual machines could provide their owners with a moderate income even during the current, bearish market. Given that additional electricity-related expenses are covered by a third-party, of course. According to D\u2019Aria:\n\u201cA gaming rig with a single high end GPU could produce maybe $1/day. But even a run of the mill laptop could produce a few cents as well. The important thing to recognize is that even though $1/day is small \u2014 if you don't have to pay for electricity, there's no reason for someone with a gaming rig or reasonably powerful laptop *not* to mine. It's literally free money.\u201d\nMoreover, generating cryptocurrency with a computer does not necessarily require substantial technical skills and knowledge. \u201cIt's extremely easy to do with services such as NiceHash [a crypto cloud mining marketplace], which can be set to automatically mine when you're not using your PC like a screen saver,\u201d D\u2019Aria added.\nIndeed, Tom (a pseudonym to maintain confidentiality), a University of Mississippi pharmaceutical sciences student, told Cointelegraph that he used NiceHash with his gaming PC to mine Bitcoin for about two months, but soon decided to abandon the idea because of the continuously high workload and rising GPU prices:\n\u201cI was able to make about $120 USD if the price of bitcoin had stayed at $15,000. With bitcoin currently around $4,000 USD it may be profitable, considering I was getting free electricity. However, because of the strain on the system, plus the overinflated prices of GPUs, I wouldn\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d\nTom specified that, being a resident advisor in the dormitory, he was able to make inroads with the local maintenance assistant. That allowed him to make sure that his floor had sufficient air conditioning to host a miner:\n\u201cIt would be impossible to tell if I had my PC on all the time, especially since it was a huge, 11- story building.\u201d\nTom\u2019s room felt chilly during the winter months, so additional heat was actually useful. He said, \u201cI just used my computer instead of a space heater.\u201d\nHowever, sometimes, mining students get exposed. Ken (a pseudonym to maintain confidentiality), an Arizona State University undergraduate who studies applied physics, showed Cointelegraph a screenshot of an alleged email from a university staff member. In it, Ken was being informed that the security team \u201chas detected a coin miner program\u201d on two of his devices.\n\u201cWe would like you to either uninstall the programs, or run a virus scan in the event that you were unaware of these programs, as this is indicative of malware on your devices,\u201d it stated.\nKen indeed was using NiceHash at the time, as he confirmed to Cointelegraph. After consulting with fellow miners on the r/BitcoinMining subreddit, he decided to use a virtual private network (VPN) whenever he was mining, saying: \u201cI already had one, and I made sure that it turned on startup and the internet kill switch was active so they couldn\u2019t track me.\u201d\nHowever, once Ken had managed to mine \u201ca couple of hundred dollars,\u201d NiceHash was hacked, and the student lost a large percentage of his funds, as he hadn\u2019t yet moved them to a private wallet.\nChris Partridge is a computing security graduate from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), who also mined cryptocurrency during his time in college, starting in 2015 and continuing until mid-2016. \u201cI was curious about Bitcoin and that seemed like a good way to learn,\u201d he told Cointelegraph. His setup was a bit more advanced compared with Tom and Ken, as he used \u201ca couple\u201d of Antminers, a BFL Monarch and a Prospero X1. Consequently, the amount of heat produced by his equipment was significantly higher:\n\u201cNone of them [the mining rigs] were remotely current-gen even at the time, and all of them were heavily underclocked/undervolted/modded to be cooler and quieter. Living up in Rochester [New York), where it was freezing all the time, we had our window open 24/7 (even during blizzards!) and the miners pointed out into it, or else it became too hot in our living areas very quickly. It was a bit of a strain for my roommate and I, but he was a good sport about things.\u201d\nPartridge said that he was never caught in the act, despite a couple of room checks that occurred due to unrelated reasons. \u201cNobody seemed to care,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially since it was a very small operation \u2014 I suppose I came off as a bit eccentric, but no further investigation was prompted.\u201d\nEven though it wasn\u2019t a profit-focused endeavor for the former RIT student, he walked away with around 0.4 BTC, which he then sold for a hefty sum of $6,000. The earnings came at just the right time: Partridge needed cash that would carry him through to an internship. After spending the money on general living expenses for a few months, he even had some left over for nonessential shopping:\n\u201cI also bought a Roomba, because if there's anything I'm going to spend profits from magic internet money on, it's a Roomba.\u201d\nThere are even larger success stories: Marco Streng, co-founder and CEO of Genesis Mining, a large cloud mining company whose farms are located across several countries, claims that he essentially started his business out of a dorm room back in 2013. He declined to specify which university he went to, however, saying that it\u2019s \u201cthe same anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\u201cThere was this kind of sauna atmosphere in my 10-13 square meter room, and the noise was really loud,\u201d he told Cointelegraph. \u201cWe tried to mitigate it by putting some pillows over the miner and put it closer to the window to cool it down.\u201d\nStreng said that, while the uproar was attracting attention, his neighbors didn\u2019t seem disturbed. \u201cI mean, I found it annoying, but it was a trade-off for me,\u201d he added. \u201cI was excited, passionate, and there was an economical aspect \u2014 it created some money.\u201d\nAround 2014, Streng realized that the local student community had started to actively set up their own mining rigs across campus. \u201cThe rumour was spreading, so it [mining] got some traction,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThe electricity bill of the student dorm went up quite significantly.\u201d\nWhen crypto market began growing and Streng\u2019s activity became increasingly profitable, he realized that he could run \u201ca few thousand of those machines,\u201d establishing a mining operation on an industrial scale.\n\u201cThat lead to the creation of Genesis Mining, one of the largest mining companies,\u201d Streng told Cointelegraph. \u201cI\u2019m really happy that I did that in my dorm and found that opportunity. Otherwise, it would never have come this far.\u201d\nHow legal and ethical is that?\nWhile no university seems to have a specific policy in regard to cryptocurrency mining on its premises, in January of 2018, Stanford University issued a public warning against crypto mining on campus, arguing that school resources \u201cmust not be used for personal financial gain.\u201d The warning also cited the university\u2019s chief information security officer:\n\u201cCryptocurrency mining is most lucrative when computing costs are minimized, which unfortunately has led to compromised systems, misused university computing equipment, and personally owned mining devices using campus power.\u201d\nIndeed, many universities seem to prohibit the use of their resources for personal financial gain \u2014 including the ones observed in this article. RIT\u2019s code of conduct for computer use, for instance, states the following:\n\u201cNo member of the RIT community may use an RIT computing account or any communications equipment that is owned or maintained by RIT to run a business or commercial service or to advertise for a commercial organization or endeavor. [...] Consistent with other specific policies, members of the RIT community should not waste university resources or use them for personal benefit or for the benefit of a non-university entity.\u201d\nHowever, not having specific rulesets for cryptocurrency mining might actually induce tax problems for educational institutions who (unwillingly or not) host such activity on their premises. As Selva Ozelli, international tax attorney and CPA, told Cointelegraph:\n\u201cGiven that electricity is usually included in a student's tuition or rent, Universities would need to set policy as to whether they will allow cryptocurrency mining on campus premises or not or whether students should be charged extra for electrical expenses relating to cryptocurrency mining. If Universities do not set proper policy in this regard, they could subject themselves to tax problems. Because section 4, Q&A-8 of Notice 2014-21 states that cryptocurrency mining which is treated as a service activity should be treated as ordinary income in the year it is mined, and the expenses of mining \u2014 including electrical charges \u2014 deducted as incurred based on the matching of income and expenses.\" \u00a0", "birthday": "2019-04-07T01:31:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-07 00:31:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 7}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-creator-and-superagent-what-you-should-know-about-craig-wright", "title": " Bitcoin Creator and Superagent: What You Should Know About Craig Wright ", "content": "Recently, it was revealed that Craig Steven Wright, one of the most controversial figures in the crypto community, had filed 114 blockchain patents since 2017. He also quit Twitter, where he would often publish his opinions on anonymity (bad), Bitcoin SV (the real Bitcoin) and other cryptocurrencies (also bad).\nHe is also known for arguing that he is actually Satoshi Nakamoto, the original creator of Bitcoin. Here\u2019s the complete list of things you should know about Wright.\nWright\u2019s bio is really rich, but hardly verifiable\nHe was born in October 1970 in Australia, according to registration papers of one of his many companies. As per a Business Insider article citing his now-edited LinkedIn profile, Wright graduated from Brisbane's Padua Catholic College in 1987. In the early 1990s, he worked as a sauce cook, \u201chaving trained in French cuisine,\u201d and spent three years working with a catering company.\nWright was reportedly studying at the University of Queensland while working as a chef. He initially attended engineering classes, but switched to computer science in his fourth year.\nIn 1996, as per his earlier LinkedIn bio, he began working at Ozemail, where he was \"managing a bunch of engineers,\" thus starting his eventful career in tech. However, according to a 2007 Computerworld article, he began working in IT when he joined K-Mart in 1985 \u2014 which would have been even before he finished high school.\nIn April 1997, Wright says he joined the Australian Stock Exchange, maintaining security and firewalls. In November the same year, he launched a company called DeMorgan, described as \"a pre-IPO Australian listed company focused on alternative currency, next generation banking and reputational and educational products with a focus on security and creating a simple user experience.\"\nIn fact, up until July 2015, Morgan was the CEO of about 15 companies. As the Guardian points out, in the space of a week, he resigned as director from Cloudcroft Pty Ltd, Coin-Exch Pty Ltd, Daso Pty Ltd, Demorgan Holdings Pty Ltd, Demorgan Ltd, Denariuz, Ezas Pty Ltd, Integyrz Pty Ltd, Misfit Games Pty Ltd, Interconnected Research Pty Ltd, Zuhl Pty Ltd and Pholus Pty Ltd, and remained the director of just three companies: Hotwire Preemptive Intelligence Pty Ltd, Panopticrypt Pty Ltd and Hotwire PE Employee Share Plan Pty Ltd. Currently, his LinkedIn only features a startup called nChain, where he has allegedly been working as a \u201cchief scientist\u201d since June 2015.\nWright seems to be a man of libertarian views. According to the Cypherpunk mailing list archive, in September 1996, Wright wrote that he had developed cancer during his years at university and took a loan to pay for medical treatment because the health insurance didn\u2019t cover it. He then mentioned that he served in the military and worked at a gas station \u201ceven though I am an engineer,\u201d adding:\n\u201cSo why and for what reason should I have to pay several 10's of thousands each year to support others. I have never taken help from the government, I do not feel I should have to pay as well. And what am I paying for...to protect the status quo. I believe that there is more than enough help for ppl available. They just need to get off their butts and work.\u201d\nIn sum, Wright\u2019s biography seems to be considerably replete and busy \u2014 or, at least, he portrays it that way. On top of having two PhDs, Wright wields numerous certifications in computer forensics and information technology (IT). In February, he published two Medium articles in which he claimed to have worked as an \u201cagent of influence\u201d in Venezuela and Colombia. Picturing himself as a James Bond-esque character fighting terrorism and evil, Wright says he was \u201cshot twice\u201d during the operation. Also, at some point, he claims that he \u201cwas a pastor once.\u201d\nAccording to his story, the Australian entrepreneur came back from South America to witness Bitcoin \u2014 which he created (more about that below) \u2014 being used on the darknet. \u00a0\n\u201cI discovered the creation I had given birth to, something I designed to bring light was being used for all the worst reasons. Not only drugs, but people. Anonymity is a curse. Nothing good comes of it.\u201d\nWright has several times claimed that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, and refused to provide sufficient proof\nWright become a known figure in crypto community after media reports linking his identity to Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, surfaced in late 2015. Previously, in 2014, one of his few reported links to cryptocurrencies was that he tried launching the world\u2019s first Bitcoin bank.\nThus, in December 2015, Wired and Gizmodo reported within hours of each other that the Australian computer scientist and entrepreneur might be the creator of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\nThe Wired story claimed that Wright \"either invented bitcoin or is a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did.\" It was based on documents and emails that were purportedly leaked by \u201can anonymous source close to Wright\u201d to an independent security researcher Gwern Branwen, who co-wrote the article with Wired author Andy Greenberg.\nSimilarly, Gizmodo ran a story that featured documents allegedly obtained by a hacker who accessed Wright's email accounts, claiming that Satoshi Nakamoto was a joint pseudonym for Craig Steven Wright and his friend, computer forensics analyst and cybersecurity specialist David Kleiman, who died in 2013.\nMoreover, on the same day the articles were published, Australian Federal Police (AFP) raided Wright\u2019s house in the Sydney suburb of Gordon. However, the AFP clarified that the operation was not related to the Bitcoin claims.\nA substantial part of the evidence presented in the reports \u2014 along with Wright\u2019s previous claims \u2014 was soon proved false. First, Wright's company Cloudcroft had declared to have two supercomputers, one of which allegedly produced by computer manufacturer SGI. However, SGI soon clarified that \"Cloudcroft has never been an SGI customer and SGI has no relationship with Cloudcroft CEO Craig Steven Wright.\"\nFurther, Wright had listed two PhDs on his LinkedIn page, including one from Charles Sturt University. Eventually, Forbes contacted the university and found out that it hadn\u2019t granted Wright any PhDs, although it gave him three master's degrees in networking and systems administration, management (IT), and information systems security. Wright was, however, awarded with a doctorate degree by Charles Sturt University later in 2017.\nAlso, a technical analysis of two PGP public keys attributed to Wright, but also linked to Satoshi Nakamoto, showed that they were created more recently than the documents in which they were featured.\nFinally, a number of posts in Wright's now-deleted blog that seemed to portray him as a person who was directly involved in Bitcoin\u2019s creation had been backdated or edited; the archived versions of the posts from 2013\u00a0show none of those breadcrumbs that Wright could have planted to mislead the media into thinking he is Satoshi.\nAfter the aforementioned stories went live, Wright promptly took down his social media accounts and disappeared for several months. On May 2, 2016, he came back (he now lives in London, United Kingdom, according to his LinkedIn profile) and publicly declared that he is the creator of Bitcoin. Later on in the same month, Wright published a sentimental apology piece where he refused to publish the proof of access to one of the earliest Bitcoin keys, saying he doesn\u2019t have the \u201ccourage\u201d do it.\nHowever, Wright still claims to be the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator. Just last month, the entrepreneur filed two near-identical comment letters to the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in which he again declared that he is Satoshi. The documents were submitted in response to the agency\u2019s request for industry input and feedback on Ethereum\u2019s (ETH) mechanics and market.\nSpecifically, Wright wrote that he worked \u201cunder the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto,\u201d and \"completed a project [...] started in 1997 that was filed with the Australian government in part under an AusIndustry project registered with the Dept. of Innovation as BlackNet.\u201d \u00a0\nBlackNet \u2014 an alleged precursor to Bitcoin \u2014 was submitted to the Australian government in 2001, according to one of Wright\u2019s tweets (he deleted his Twitter profile earlier this month).\nOn Reddit, user Skoopitup argued that the BlackNet paper that Wright supposedly submitted in 2001 largely copied the official Bitcoin white paper (published October 2008), which notably contained significant corrections to an earlier draft that had been shared by Satoshi earlier in August 2008.\nIn his remaining comments to the CFTC, Wright wrote:\n\u201cThe amount of misunderstanding and fallacious information that has been propagated concerning bitcoin [...] has resulted in my choice to start to become more public. The system I created was designed in part to end fraud as best as that can be done with any technology. The lack of understanding [...] has resulted in [...] a dissemination of old scams.\u201d\nThe Australian entrepreneur still hasn\u2019t signed a message with the key associated with Bitcoin's genesis block, which could be seen as strong evidence of him actually being Satoshi Nakamoto.\nWright played a key role in the BCH hash wars \u2014 and now claims that Bitcoin SV is the original Bitcoin\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is a cryptocurrency that emerged on Aug. 1, 2017 after departing from Bitcoin\u2019s original blockchain via a hard fork in an attempt to manage its scalability issue.\nThe BCH network performs hard forks as part of scheduled protocol upgrades. The fork scheduled for Nov. 15, 2018, however, was disrupted by a competing proposal that was not compatible with the original roadmap. As a result, the BCH community was split into three fractions: Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin SV.\nCraig Wright lead the Bitcoin SV team, whose goal was to restore \u201cthe original Satoshi protocol\u201d by changing the current BCH structure. Specifically, that involved entirely overwriting the network scripts of Bitcoin ABC and increasing the block size of BCH from 32MB to a maximum of 128MB in order to increase network capacity and scale. Bitcoin SV\u2019s cryptocurrency design was made by Wright\u2019s nChain company.\nAt some point, after Jihan Wu, co-founder of major crypto miner and manufacturer Bitmain, who supported the Bitcoin ABC team, accused Wright of being a Blockstream spy and a \u201cfake Satoshi.\u201d In response, the computer scientist entered a verbal fight. Specifically, Wright tagged Roger Ver \u2014 another ABC proponent \u2014 and Bitmain with bankruptcy threats and accusations of being engaged in Silk Road machinations and child pornography.\nEven though Bitcoin ABC essentially won the so-called \u201chash wars\u201d and secured the original BCH ticker, Bitcoin SV lives on. In late February, Bitcoin SV\u2019s value rose 20 percent, driving it into the top-10 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. As of press time, Bitcoin SV is the 12th-largest token, with a market cap of $1.5 million, according to CoinMarketCap.\nCraigh Wright has a lot of blockchain patents\nAccording to the publication Hard Fork, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has published 155 patents applications filed by Wright \u2014 all of which were submitted through his company nChain. Thirty-five of those were published this year. The earliest document date relates to Aug. 31, 2017.\nThe majority of those applications mention blockchain. Specifically, Hard Fork writes, the term \u201cblockchain\u201d was used 114 times in patent titles. \u201cCryptocurrency,\u201d in turn, is only featured six times, while \u201cBitcoin\u201d is not mentioned at all.\nWright has written about his patents quest via Twitter (which has been deleted). According to the screenshots cited by Hard Fork, Wright decided to file his patents in Europe because it was \u201charder\u201d:\n\u201cOnce we have the EU, we have the PCT [Patent Cooperation Treaty] in the USA. The US is simpler.\u201d\nThe Patent Cooperation Treaty has been signed by 152 countries. After filing one international patent application under the PCT, applicants can get simultaneously protection for their inventions in many countries.\nAs per Bloomberg, business-wise blockchain patents \u201care an essential ingredient for companies looking to reshape the financial services industry or spawn profitable cryptocurrency-related businesses.\u201d Basically, such patents help companies attract investment, protect property rights and collect monopoly profits from other companies using their inventions.\nIt\u2019s been argued that Wright is filing patents without the intent of actually using them, but instead to demand large payouts from companies which happen to use similar technologies in their line of work. As Marc Kaufman, an attorney who co-chairs the Blockchain Intellectual Property Council at the U.S. Chamber of Digital Commerce, told Fortune:\n\u201cHis tactics and activities have all the marks of being a patent assertion entity or what\u2019s pejoratively known as a troll. I\u2019m not aware of his companies having any products.\u201d\nCraig Wright is being sued for at least $1 billion\nIn February 2018, the estate of David Kleiman \u2014 Wright\u2019s associate and computer forensics expert who died in April 2013 seemingly of natural causes related to complications from a MRSA infection \u2014 brought the suit against Wright to the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Florida. The estate is represented by Ira Kleiman, David\u2019s brother.\nAccording to court documents that surfaced on Reddit, the plaintiff claims that Wright stole hundreds of thousands of BTC, worth over $5 billion dollars at the time, from David Kleiman\u2019s estate. The statement by the plaintiff alleges that Wright recognized that Kleiman\u2019s friends and family were initially unaware of the wealth he accumulated.\nSpecifically, the statement reads, Wright \u201cforged a series of contracts that purported to transfer Dave\u2019s assets to Craig and/or companies controlled by him. Craig backdated these contracts and forged Dave\u2019s signature on them.\u201d\nWright contacted Kleiman\u2019s estate after his associate\u2019s death and disclosed that he and David had worked together to develop blockchain and Bitcoin, according to the plaintiff.\nIn December 2018, new documents were published online, indicating that the court had rejected repeated requests from the nChain chief scientist to dismiss the lawsuit.\nIn an amended lawsuit supported by Judge Beth Bloom, a figure of 300,000 BTC ($1.5 billion as of press time) was now circulating.\n\u201cThe Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a claim for conversion,\u201d the court document confirms, continuing:\n\u201cThe Amended Complaint alleges that Defendant converted at least 300,000 bitcoins upon Dave\u2019s death and transferred them to various international trusts, which was an unauthorized act that deprived the Plaintiffs of the bitcoins therein. Accordingly, Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for conversion [...] survives Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss.\u201d\nIn March 2019, Jeff Garzik, one of the earliest contributors to the Bitcoin codebase, was reportedly subpoenaed by the court for documents relating to the Kleiman vs. Wright complaint.\nSpecifically, the court demanded \u201call documents, communications, and agreements that support his [Jeff\u2019s] personal theory that Dave Kleiman is Satoshi Nakamoto.\u201d In a 2018 interview with Bloomberg, Garzik suggested that Dave Kleiman was the original creator of Bitcoin.\nWright doesn\u2019t have a particularly good relationship with crypto community\nAfter some of the aforementioned inconsistencies related to Wright\u2019s claim that he is Satoshi surfaced, the crypto community became increasingly skeptical about the Australian computer scientist. However, some of his claims in regard to other cryptocurrencies certainly didn\u2019t help.\nIn January 2019, for instance, he called Andreas Antonopoulos, author of the book \u201cMastering Bitcoin,\u201d a \u201cshitcoin expert.\u201d In February this year, Wright told CNBC Africa\u2019s Ran Neuner in a rather rude form that he knows how to deanonymize and destroy privacy coins Zcash and Monero, which he apparently is going to do \u201csometime this year\u201d:", "birthday": "2019-04-07T23:52:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-07 22:52:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 7}

A statement was made during a speech about the launch of Electronic Money Institutions, when Ahmad noted that the central bank is already working on their central bank digital currency (CBDC) as a way to financial inclusion and efficiency and combat corruption. According to Ahmad, the CBDC will only be deployed in 2030. As previously reported, Pakistan is in the process of implementing new cryptocurrency regulations in an effort to improve its track record fighting financial crime.\nBloomberg: Bitcoin's Recent Renaissance Could Be Linked to Algorithmic Trading\nBloomberg reported this week that the recent cryptocurrency market jump could be linked to algorithmic trading. The trading method uses automated software to detect trends and determine when trades should be made, and Bloomberg states that the industry has seen 17 new algo or quantitative funds launched since September. According to Bloomberg\u2019s data, algo funds reported gains of between 3 and 10% per month during the past crypto winter, while crypto funds lost a total of around 72% during the same time.\n \nWinners and Losers\n\nThe crypto markets are still trading high at the end of the week, with Bitcoin at $5,158, Ethereum around $168 and Ripple at $0.36.

To fight cancer, to balance renewable energy, to trace the authenticity of goods, actors must be able to trust one another without meeting face-to-face. And how can we achieve this? Of course, with the help of blockchain.\u201d\nMariya Gabriel, European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society\n\u00a0\n\u201cAll indications that we have \u2014 whether it be fundamentals, technicals, the quantitative analysis we do \u2014 all suggest that we probably have at least started to put in the bottoming process.\u201d\nBrian Kelly, founder and CEO of digital currency investment firm BKCM LLC\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs soon as there is news about [CBDC issuance] the people in crypto get excited and say, see it\u2019s becoming mainstream [...] but if you look carefully about what they want to do, if and when they\u2019re going to do it, it\u2019s not going to be blockchain, it\u2019s not going to be crypto [...] it\u2019s going to be on a single ledger, secured.\u201d\nNouriel Roubini, American economist and notorious crypto critic\n\u00a0\n\u201cShorts are liquidated, there were short squeezes, more people jumped onto the hype, and a lot of news media always look for a trigger to cause big drops and big rises. I would say more than half the time they are just trying to match news to something that it did not necessarily need news to happen.\u201d\nTone Vays, Bitcoin analyst\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe are poised to achieve ten thousand times their capacity.\u201d\nAndreas Antonopoulos, crypto entrepreneur, speaking about extant payment systems such as Visa and MasterCard\n\u00a0\n\u201cBlockchain has the potential to virtually exclude loss, distortion, or forgery of vital log data in all aviation sectors where certificates are issued and controlled.\u201d\nDr. Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, president of the United Nation\u2019s specialized agency for aviation\n\nPrediction of the Week\nBrian Kelly Says Next Target for Bitcoin is $6,000, With Crypto Markets Bottoming\nBrian Kelly, the founder and CEO of digital currency investment firm BKCM LLC, has predicted that Bitcoin\u2019s next target price is going to be $6,000. Speaking in an interview with CNBC, Kelly stated that $6,000 was a reasonable price point, his comments coming in the aftermath of this week\u2019s price surge that saw Bitcoin\u2019s price jump by over 15 percent to reach over $5,000 for the first time since November 2018. Kelly put forward the idea that the influx of institutional investors is one of the reasons behind the price upswing.\nFUD of the Week\nErnst & Young Argues That Crypto Exchange QuadrigaCX Should Be Placed in Bankruptcy\nBig Four audit firm Ernst & Young (EY), which is working with now-defunct Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, said this week that the exchange should be placed in bankruptcy rather than being restructured. The exchange had been undergoing legal proceedings since it reportedly lost access to its cold wallet holdings after the unexpected death of its founder, Gerald Cotten, in December 2018. In EY\u2019s new report, they propose that the ongoing restructuring process should be shifted to an alternative bankruptcy process. The benefits of shifting to proceedings under the BIA, the report argues, include the fact that bankruptcy \u201cwould allow for the potential sale of assets, including but not limited to Quadriga\u2019s operating platform.\u201d\nResearch: Ethereum-Based Prediction Market Augur Currently Faces a Design Flaw Attack\nEthereum-based (ETH) prediction market Augur currently has a design flaw attack, according to research made by crypto exchange Binance. The attack mentioned in the report involves a controversial market that bets on the price of ETH at the end of March, but has a discrepancy over the actual ending time of the contract versus the title. According to the research, this discrepancy could cause the contract to be deemed invalid, dividing the contributions to give back to users at one third of their value. Binance notes that this flaw could be taken advantage of by bad actors: an Augur executive has already said that the next Augur upgrade will work towards a solution.", "birthday": "2019-04-07T18:50:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-07 17:50:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 7}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-wash-trading-sifting-facts-from-fears", "title": " Bitcoin Wash Trading: Sifting Facts From Fears ", "content": "In mid-March, Bitwise Asset Management issued a damning report on Bitcoin (BTC) trading figures. The San Francisco-based index fund provider declared that up 95 percent of Bitcoin trading volume as seen on CoinMarketCap (CMC) was due to so-called wash trading.\nWash trading is a type of market manipulation where sell and buy orders are simultaneously placed on the same asset to create false and misleading trading activity in the market. Wash trading is illegal in regulated exchange platforms.\n95 percent of BTC trading volume is fake\nAs part of its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Bitwise submitted a proposed rule change that included a report on the Bitcoin trading market. According to the report, 95 percent of the recorded BTC trading volume is due to wash trading by bots.\nSo, where CMC figures would show about $11 billion in daily BTC trading volume, the actual figure less wash trading would be about $470 million. For Bitwise, the problem comes from the fact that CMC and other similar platforms use fake data from obscure cryptocurrency exchange platforms.\nThe revelations from the Bitwise report on wash trading echo the findings of previous reports released by the Blockchain Transparency Institute (BTI) and Tie \u2014 a trading analytics platform. As reported by Cointelegraph, data from 97 exchanges show that 87 percent of cryptocurrency exchange volume was potentially false, according to Tie.\nThese revelations caused considerable debate among stakeholders in the industry. Critics of platforms like CMC were quick to point out the flaws in CMC\u2019s metrics. Others also ignited the price manipulation debate and the impact of the overwhelming level of wash trading on BTC price discovery.\nIs CMC to blame?\nCMC is a cryptocurrency market data provider and is among the top-500 visited websites in the world. Trading volume figures on a platform as popular as CMC arguably play a major role in shaping market trading. Thus, there is a palpable concern about the effect of such inflated trading volumes on the market in general.\nThe data provided by CMC comes directly from exchanges listed on the websites. Some of these platforms domiciled in loosely regulated spheres are reportedly wont to inflate their trading figures to attain a higher position on the CMC ranking of exchange platforms by 24-hour trading volumes.\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph, Changpeng Zhao (aka CZ), CEO of Binance \u2014 one of the largest cryptocurrency exchange platforms in the market \u2014 says that CMC isn\u2019t solely to blame. According to Zhao:\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much CoinMarketCap\u2019s fault. Everyone tries to blame them, but CMC is a very simple reporting mechanism where every exchange reports their own data to it and they just show it.\u201d\nWhile CZ appears sympathetic toward CMC, others believe the platform is to blame. Ryan Selkis of Messari, another cryptocurrency market data provider, declared via his Twitter handle that CMC\u2019s data is mostly wrong, and this includes market cap, circulating supply and, of course, trading volumes.\nSelkis pointed to the supply readings for XLM and XRP as examples of false and misleading data on the CMC platform. For these two cryptocurrencies in particular, the significant treasuries held by institutions with strong affiliations to the tokens help to inflate their market capitalization values, thus earning higher rankings on CMC.\nThis incorrect data paints an exaggerated picture of the global cryptocurrency market that obscures the real size of the market. Given the sheer proportion of wash trading by bots, the effect of such a reality on the fidelity of the market becomes the next logical inquiry.\nEffect of wash trading on price \u2014 market manipulation?\nThe fear of price manipulation is never far from Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Back in 2018, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) began investigating claims of market manipulation in the market.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) also initiated a separate investigation into the manipulation of BTC and Ethereum (ETH) via wash trading and spoofing. So, then is the ongoing high volume of wash trading significantly impacting the prices of cryptocurrencies?\nCommenting on the issue in an email, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital \u2014 a cryptocurrency hedge fund \u2014 opined:\n\u201cIf 95% of CMC\u2019s BTC trading volume is fake, as per the report, it means market activity is being manipulated and the current price is not reflecting true market sentiment. However, as more reputable exchanges enter the space, this effect should diminish, since most of the \u2018real\u2019 trading is already taking place on well-known exchanges.\u201d\nMati Greenspan, a senior market analyst at eToro, made the same conclusion in a recent market analysis article, saying on his blog:\n\u201cThe key here is that all this wash trading that\u2019s been discovered hasn\u2019t actually affected the price of bitcoin itself in any meaningful way. In fact, if we focus only on the real 10 exchanges, we can see that this market is much more robust than previously perceived.\u201d\nAccording to Greenspan\u2019s analysis and the Bitwise report, most of the market liquidity comes from 10 exchanges, even though there are hundreds of such platforms. Nine out of these 10 platforms are regulated, and the price of BTC displayed among them is fairly consistent.\nSo, if wash trading isn\u2019t having a significant impact on price, why then is the practice this widespread? The answer probably lies in the attempts by these much smaller platforms to gain a larger share of the trading market.\nBy inflating their figures, they can rise up the CMC rankings. Such a situation gives them the opportunity to attract more users and charge higher listing fees.\nHow to Identify Fake Trading Volume\nSome industry commentators have laid down numerous methodologies that could be used to identify fake trading volumes. Cointelegraph spoke with Joshua Frank, co-founder of Tie, who said comparing website viewership and trading volume was one of the easiest ways of identifying suspicious trading volumes.\nAccording to Frank, the firm\u2019s research showed a major distinction between those two metrics for \u201creputable platforms\u201d and lesser known exchanges. Many of the exchanges suspected of wash trading routinely show figures like $400,000 in trading volume per view. Meanwhile, on well-known platforms, the figures are closer to $500-$600.\nFrank also went on to state that the company decided to make the data available to the public via Google Sheets. The Tie co-founder said more experienced traders can also examine the trading history and order book of exchanges to spot suspicious trading data.\nSince most exchange platforms are centralized, it is possible for them to inflate their figures by trading the same cryptocurrencies between a pair of bot accounts repeatedly. This gives rise to false high-volume figures that create the appearance of high liquidity.\nSolving the Problem of Fake Trading Volume\nIn the wake of revelation from Bitwise, several stakeholders have proposed solutions to the fake trading volume problem. For CMC, the first step would be to improve the way it presents market data to users.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nBitcoin showed a glimpse of its former self when it skyrocketed by about 20 percent on April 2. With no specific news responsible for the rise, we can only speculate on what caused the sudden spurt in prices. Many theories have been put forth, one being a large order either by an individual trader or a group of traders that caused the price to break above the overhead resistance, following which the algorithms spotted the breakout and piled on long positions. Many traders who had been short on the digital currency were forced to cover their positions, which may have added fuel to the rally.\nHowever, these are only assumptions. The important question to ask is whether this rally can sustain. If we only see a minor pullback across the board, it will confirm that a bottom is in place and that cryptocurrencies are about to start a new uptrend. This will force the investors sitting on the sidelines to jump in, which can push prices higher.\nIf the prices fail to sustain the higher levels, it will indicate that the current rally was only an aberration. There are advocates for both sides of the trade, but we believe in letting the markets do the talking. Let\u2019s see what the charts say and devise our strategy accordingly.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) led from the front on April 2, as it broke out of the overhead resistance at $4,255 and soared close to $5,000. By sustaining above $4,255, it completed a double bottom pattern that had a target objective of $5,273.91. Currently, the leading digital currency is a tad below this level.\nBetween the current levels and $5,900, there is no significant resistance point. However, the RSI has entered deep into overbought territory, which can result in a couple of days of consolidation or a minor correction. Hence, traders can book profits on about 30 percent of the long positions at the current levels and buy on dips once again. The stop loss on the rest of the position can be kept at $4,200.\n\nThe BTC/USD pair might pull back towards $4,400 in a retest of the breakout level. If it rebounds sharply from the support, it will confirm a bottom and the start of a new uptrend. The moving averages are trending higher, which shows that the bulls have the upper hand. Our bullish view will be negated if the price plunges below $4,255. Such a move will indicate a lack of buying and formation of shorts at higher levels.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) has broken out of the overhead resistance at $167.32. If the bulls manage to close (UTC time frame) above this level, it will complete an ascending triangle pattern. The target objective of this bullish setup is $251.64.\n\nIf the ETH/USD pair fails to sustain above $167.32, it can fall back into the triangle. It will weaken if it plunges below the support at $145. The moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in overbought territory. This shows that the bulls are in command and any pullback should quickly find buying support. For now, traders can keep a stop loss of $140 on the remaining long positions. We shall trail the stops higher again in a couple of days.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) broke out of both the overhead resistance of $0.33108 and the resistance line of the descending channel on April 2. Such a large range move after days of consolidation in a tight range is a bullish sign. It shows a probable change in trend that can first carry the digital currency to $0.40 and above it to $0.45097. The medium-term target is $0.60.\n\nTypically, the price retests the breakout level and then resumes the up move. Therefore, we anticipate a couple of days of consolidation or a minor correction, which should find support at $0.33108. Traders can wait for this retest to be successful before initiating long positions once again. But if the XRP/USD pair fails to stay above $0.33108 during the next pullback, it will be a negative sign.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) blasted off the overhead resistance of $62.45 and easily exceeded our target of $69.2790. It is currently on the road to $100. We expect a strong resistance between $91\u2013$100, hence, we suggest traders\u2019 book complete profits on the remaining long positions at the current levels.\nThe trend is bullish as both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone. Therefore, we shall again look to buy the cryptocurrency on dips to strong support levels.\n\nWe find a large rounding bottom pattern, which will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $91. This is a bullish reversal pattern and has a minimum target objective of $159.\nThe LTC/USD pair will lose momentum if it turns around from the current levels and plummets back into the ascending channel.\nEOS/USD\nEOS scaled above the overhead resistance of $4.4930 on April 2 and is currently close to our target objective of $5.8370. Both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, which shows that the bulls are firmly in command. However, a few days of consolidation or a minor correction cannot be ruled out.\n\nAny pullback from the current level should find support close to the breakout level of $4.4930. A successful retest of this level will be a positive sign. In the medium-term, the EOS/USD pair can rally to $6.8299. Therefore, traders can trail the stops on the remaining long positions to $4.40. We might suggest booking partial profits once again if we find the rally faltering. The pair will turn negative if it fails to sustain above $4.4930.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) skyrocketed on Tuesday and followed it up with further gains on Wednesday. With the latest rise, it has exceeded the target objective of $249.60. Traders can pocket 40 percent of the gains around the current levels and raise the stop loss on the remaining long positions to $210. The RSI has shot deep into the overbought zone; hence, a minor correction or consolidation cannot be ruled out.\n\nWe do not recommend closing out the complete position because the BCH/USD pair does not have any significant resistance up to $400 and it also has a history of vertical rallies.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink and sustain the price below $239. This will show profit booking at higher levels and a lack of follow up demand by the bulls. As long as the digital currency stays above $239, it is on target to move higher.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) broke out and closed (UTC time frame) above the critical overhead resistance of $18 on April 2. This is a bullish sign as it shows demand even at higher levels. With the latest rise, the cryptocurrency has come very close to the lifetime highs at $26.4732350. This is a major sentiment booster as it confirms that the prices reached during the peak of the crypto mania in January 2018 can be scaled.\n\nHowever, the BNB/USD pair has rallied sharply from the lows, hence, some amount of profit booking and a consolidation in the short term is a possibility. Therefore, traders can trail the stop loss on the remaining long positions to just below the 20-day EMA. Traders can even pocket the complete gains on a spike to $25, if it happens.\nThe trend remains strong as both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone. A breakdown of the 20-day EMA will be the first sign of weakness. Until then, the cryptocurrency remains strong and on target to retest the lifetime highs.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) rose to hit our first target objective at $0.13250273. If this level is scaled, the next target is $0.14861760. This will act as a major roadblock because the long-term downtrend line is just above this level. Therefore, traders can book profits on 40 percent of the long positions close to $0.13 and trail the stops on the rest to break even.\n\nWith both the moving averages gradually sloping higher and the RSI in the overbought zone, the bulls continue to be in the driver\u2019s seat. Therefore, we are not recommending closing out the complete position.\nBut if the XLM/USD pair turns down from the overhead resistance levels, it can dip to the 20-day EMA, which should provide a strong support. The trend will turn in favor of the bears on a breakdown of the uptrend line.\nADA/USD\nCardano (ADA) has reached both our target levels of $0.082 and above it $0.094. The sharp rally has carried the RSI into \u00a0overbought territory and the price is currently at a stiff resistance. Hence, we might see a few days of consolidation or a minor correction at these levels. Traders can book profits on 50 percent of the remaining long positions and hold the rest with the stops at $0.075.", "birthday": "2019-04-03T20:16:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-03 19:16:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 3}

Many investors who did not know how to hedge their cryptocurrency investments saw these investments lose value from the market highs of 2017.\nFacing the deadline to report their taxes by April 15, 2019, United States individual taxpayers may wonder what their United States tax reporting obligations are if they held, donated or sold/exchanged their cryptocurrencies at a loss during 2018.\nA taxpayer\u2019s dilemma\nLet's imagine a potential 2019 taxpayer sitting in front of his tax advisor and feeling embarrassed to tell him that he had lost 90 percent of a 100K investment in cryptocurrencies when the cryptocurrency markets experienced a downturn during 2018, with leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) down 80 percent or more.\nThe taxpayer invested heavily into crypto at the end of 2017 and beginning of 2018 \u2014 which he said he regretted everyday since then, because he lost almost all of it.\nThe tax advisor assured the taxpayer that this would give rise to a taxable event only if he sold, exchanged or donated his cryptocurrency during 2018, and that these things would need to be reported on his U.S. tax return \u2014 noting, however, that holding cryptocurrencies would not give rise to a taxable event but may give rise to tax-reporting requirements if the cryptocurrencies were held in a foreign financial account.\nCryptocurrency hodlers\nIf a taxpayer for 2018 has not sold, exchanged or donated the cryptocurrency he bought at the end of 2017 or beginning of 2018 and is still holding them, then there is no taxable event to report on his U.S. tax return.\nTax-reporting requirements would arise if the taxpayer held these cryptocurrencies in a foreign financial account and if mandatory financial thresholds were met under Foreign Bank Account Report (FBAR) and Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) reporting requirements, according to a letter from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\nFBAR: A taxpayer with a financial interest in or signatory authority over a foreign financial account must file a foreign bank account report (FBAR) FinCEN Form 114 if the aggregate value of the foreign financial account exceeds $10,000 at any time during the calendar year. Noncompliance with FBAR would subject a taxpayer to steep civil and criminal penalties. Each nonwillful failure to file violation can carry a civil penalty of $10,000. Penalties for each willful violation could be the greater of $100,000 or 50 percent of the amount in the account.\nFATCA: A taxpayer with foreign financial assets of $50,000 or more must report it for FATCA purposes on Form 8938. It is recommended that cryptocurrency-invested hedge fund accounts and cryptocurrency-denominated exchange accounts be reported in the summary information in Part I of Form 8938. Specific information should be given in Part V. Noncompliance with FATCA could subject a taxpayer to taxes, severe penalties in excess of the unreported foreign assets, and exclusion from access to U.S. markets, which could include a regulated cryptocurrency derivatives clearing market.\nCryptocurrency charitable donations\nA taxpayer may feel generous and decide to donate their cryptocurrencies to a tax code Section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charity of their choice, to give the charity a large gift.\nSince a\u00a0cryptocurrency is considered property for U.S. tax purposes, it will be valued at the time of donation at its fair market value. Donors of cryptocurrencies of over $500 \u2014 which are noncash donations \u2014 will be required to comply with IRS appraisal requirements by filing\u00a0Form 8283. The donation will be tax deductible for the U.S. individual donor as follows:\u00a0\nIf the donor held the cryptocurrency as a capital asset for more than a year, the donor will be able to deduct the fair market value of the gift up to 30 percent of their adjusted gross income (AGI).\u00a0If the donor held the cryptocurrency as a capital asset for a short term (i.e., less than one year) or as ordinary income property, the donor will be able to deduct the lesser of cost basis or fair market value up to 50 percent of their AGI.\u00a0\nIf the donor received the cryptocurrency as payment for services rendered, the donor may claim a deduction of the fair market value on the date of receipt.\u00a0\nCharitable contributions that are not deductible in the current year, because they exceed the taxpayer\u2019s AGI limitation, can be carried forward for five years.", "birthday": "2019-04-02T00:10:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-01 23:10:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 1}

Decentralized Debate on Reddit ", "content": "According to a Reddit thread on March 19, traders on Augur, a decentralized oracle and peer-to-peer protocol for prediction markets, are being scammed. The Reddit user claims that \u201csome people\u201d in the Augur community are exploiting a design element of the Augur protocol by purposefully creating invalid markets through ambiguous wording. This allows them to profit by gaming the system, rendering Augur \u201cunusable.\u201d\nAugur\u2019s co-founder, Joseph Krug, took to Twitter to explain that, admittedly there is a problem, but downplayed the extent of its effect on the network. \u201cSome people,\u201d as stated in the Reddit thread, is actually only one bad actor, according to Krug, and the malfunctioning element of the protocol will be fixed in the updated v2 of Augur. Krug said:\n\u201cAlmost all of these purposefully confusing markets are being created by one person, not a bunch of people. The activity on those markets is also by one person / address.\u201d\nThe very first response in the Reddit thread called for a \u201ccentralized system\u201d as a possible solution to the problem, which sparked a lengthy debate on the pros and cons of centralization vs. decentralization \u2014 and both detractors and supporters weighed in.\nHow do prediction markets work?\nPrediction markets are essentially groups of people speculating on the outcome of a future event. Traditionally, this is common in elections or sporting events, but in reality, there\u2019s no limitation to the situations that prediction markets could be applied to. From speculating on whether certain stocks will go up or down on a specific future date to whether it will be sunny or rainy on this exact day next year, as long as the outcome will result in a clear \u201ceither/or situation,\u201d a market can be created.\nMarket participants \u2014 or traders \u2014 will then buy a share in either result. If they predict the correct outcome, they will receive a payout in proportion to the value of their share; if not, they will lose their money. This is also why prediction markets are often considered betting or gambling. The key difference is that prediction markets will lean toward the wisdom of the crowd \u2014 the idea that large groups of people are more knowledgeable collectively than individual experts. The value of a bet will, in most cases, reflect the probability of an outcome materializing. As a result, market analyzers will quite often look at how a prediction market is progressing to form an opinion as to that specific market outcome.\nWhat\u2019s the difference with a decentralized prediction market?\nApart from trading being supposedly cheaper, the biggest difference in a decentralized prediction market, like Augur, is that outcomes are determined by the combination of an oracle and a decentralized reporter. The oracle is used to feed the information from the real world to the blockchain. Reporters then stake tokens on an outcome to verify that it matches the real-world result.\nIn traditional markets, the results would be determined by an impartial, yet centralized judge \u2014 which, ironically, Augur states in its white paper, would \u201crequire traders to trust the market operator to not steal funds and to resolve markets correctly.\u201d\nWhat is \u201cthe scam\u201d?\nAugur, which raised $5 million in its 2015 initial coin offering (ICO) and which Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin called the \u201cUber for knowledge\u201d has a mechanism called a validity bond \u2014 supposedly to incentivize market creators to initiate markets based on well-defined events with objective, unambiguous outcomes. The market creator posts the validity bond and only gets their stake refunded if the outcome of the market is anything other than invalid. Validity bonds should increase if more than 1 percent of the finalized markets in the previous fee window were invalid. However, according to Krug, it is this system that is currently malfunctioning:\n\u201cRight now the bond for a market being invalid doesn\u2019t increase as much as it should due to some bug. So the more invalid markets there are the market validity bond isn\u2019t increasing as much as it should.\u201d\nWhen a market is determined to be invalid by reporters because none of the outcomes listed by the market creator is correct \u2014 or because the market wording is ambiguous \u2014 traders who settle with the market contract receive an equal amount of ETH for shares of each outcome.", "birthday": "2019-04-02T16:55:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-02 15:55:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 2}

Gox Saga Continues ", "content": "It is one of the biggest cryptocurrency hacks of all time and still remains the biggest Bitcoin (BTC) hack the world has ever seen. The 2011, a security breach on Mt. Gox\u2019s platform, the now-defunct Japanese cryptocurrency exchange, saw 850,000 Bitcoin stolen. Although 200,000 BTC have since been recovered, the subsequent closure of the exchange in 2014 left 24,000 creditors in its wake.\nEight years later, the story continues with its villainized ex-CEO, Mark Karpeles, at the forefront and creditors still in the dark as to what a payout agreement would look like.\nIn early February 2019, Cointelegraph reported on an alleged photo, posted on Reddit, that showed a former business partner of Mt. Gox, CoinLab, filing a 1.7 trillion Japanese yen claim against the late exchange. This is an increase on its original claim of $75 million that it sued Mt. Gox for in 2013. The original lawsuit was filed for a breach of contract, with CoinLab claiming that it was supposed to take over the American customers of Mt. Gox, according to a contract between the two parties. But it never happened. Some crypto community members are of the opinion that this inflated claim will delay creditor payments even further.\nIndustry commentators also believe that the trustee responsible for managing the remaining Mt. Gox assets, Tokyo lawyer Nobuaki Kobayashi, might be partially responsible for the Bitcoin crash at the beginning of 2018, due to the thousands of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) that were \u201cdumped\u201d into the market. This totalled around $700 million by the end of June 2018. Although other analysts believe that the launch of the CME Bitcoin futures also had a role to play in the market crash. The San Francisco Federal Reserve stated at the time:\n\"The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence. It is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset.\u201d\nIn February 2019, there were also talks of a Mt. Gox revival of sorts, with prominent blockchain and cryptocurrency entrepreneur Brock Pierce starting a movement called Gox Rising.

Back in March 2017, the SEC\u00a0rejected the application for a Bitcoin ETF put forward by the Winklevoss twins, claiming that the underlying Bitcoin market was still too manipulable, volatile and resistant to surveillance. Fast forward to March 2019 and the SEC has still yet to approve a single Bitcoin ETF, with the comments to its latest public consultation\u00a0remaining largely negative.\nSuch an absence of major progress may seem fatally discouraging to casual observers hoping for an ETF to provide crypto with added legitimacy. Nonetheless, the intervening period between March 2017 and the present day has witnessed a softening of the SEC's stance, with members of the commission even going so far as\u00a0declaring that they expect a Bitcoin ETF to be approved sooner or later. There is, then, plenty of reason to draw hope from the SEC's recent dealings with Bitcoin ETF applicants, even if the longer-term history shows that the commission hasn't always adopted a favorable stance toward crypto.\n2017: SEC claims manipulability, volatility and absence of surveillance\nOn June 30, 2016, the Bats BZX Exchange filed a proposed rule change with the SEC, which would have permitted it to list and trade shares of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. If approved, the Winklevoss' ETF would have been the first Bitcoin exchange-traded fund licensed to appear on a fully regulated stock exchange, thereby making it possible for the layperson to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to actually own the cryptocurrency or wrestle with crypto exchanges or wallets.\nNo doubt this would have represented a big step toward the mainstream for crypto, yet after a long period of deliberation and\u00a0consultation, the SEC\u00a0rejected the proposed rule change. On March 10, 2017, it\u00a0released a statement explaining the reasoning behind its decision, with the difficulty of preventing manipulation and fraud being at the top of its list.\n\"Based on the record before it, the Commission believes that the significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated. Therefore, as the Exchange has not entered into, and would currently be unable to enter into, the type of surveillance-sharing agreement that has been in place with respect to all previously approved commodity-trust ETPs agreements that help address concerns about the potential for fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices in this market \u2014 the Commission does not find the proposed rule change to be consistent with the Exchange Act.\"\nBarely two weeks after this judgment had been published, the SEC denied a similar proposal submitted by NYSE Arca, which is owned by the Intercontinental Exchange and which wanted to list the SolidX Bitcoin Trust ETF. Reusing many of the same phrases and declarations, the commission\u00a0wrote on March 28 that \"it does not find the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.\"\nAs the two episodes above imply, 2017 wasn't a particularly great year for Bitcoin ETFs or for the notion that the SEC might be inclined to license one of them \u2014 because, aside from SolidX and Winklevoss, an ETF from Barry Silbert's Grayscale Investments was\u00a0registered with the the SEC in January 2017, and it fared no better than its rivals. It was\u00a0subject to a delay on March 22, after it had received\u00a0three comments \u2014 all negative \u2014 from members of the public, and then in September of the same year, it\u00a0withdrew its application, citing a lack of \"regulatory developments\" in the crypto market as the main reason for this action.\nBetween March and September, the public sent the SEC additional comments as part of the consultation, and while they ended up numbering only 21 in total, a portion of them provide insight into why Grayscale Investments wasn't likely to gain approval for its ETF at that time.\nFor example, a seven-page\u00a0letter from Mark T. Williams, a finance professor at Boston University, details a long list of reasons as to why a Bitcoin ETF \u2014 particularly from Grayscale Investments \u2014 wasn't appropriate. These include Bitcoin market flaws, such as \"poor price discovery, irregular trade execution, shallow trade volume, hoarding, relatively low liquidity, hyperprice volatility, a global web of unregulated bucket-shop exchanges, high bankruptcy risk and oversized exposure to trading and price discovery in countries outside the jurisdiction of the SEC.\" Yet, Williams also noted that Digital Currency Group \u2014 which owns Grayscale Investments and Coindesk (among other ventures) \u2014 \"is fraught with inherent conflicts of interest.\"\nBut while this would suggest that there was some strong opposition to this particular ETF, other researchers outside the cryptocurrency industry were more positive. \"Moving bitcoin trading activity to regulated US exchanges will improve price discovery and reduce the potential for manipulation and money laundering,\"\u00a0argued James J. Angel, an associate professor of finance at Georgetown University.\nLikewise, professor Campbell R. Harvey of Duke University (and colleagues)\u00a0wrote that \"allowing the Bitcoin Investment Trust to list its shares on the NYSE Arca as a bona fide Exchange-Traded Product (\u2018ETP\u2019) would demonstrate the Commission\u2019s utmost commitment to achieving\" its aims of protecting investors, maintaining efficient markets and aiding capital formation. Given that six other economists from six other American universities signed this statement, it revealed that there was actually considerable support for the idea of a Bitcoin ETF, even if the SEC couldn't be disabused of its view that the cryptocurrency market was still too anarchic for it to approve such a fund.\n2018: Growing support from the wider industry\nAs 2017 came to close, there was then a very real sense that the SEC viewed the Bitcoin market with suspicion, and that its sceptical views on the market were reinforced by a significant chunk of the comments it had received from people outside of the crypto industry. However, this unfavorable situation began to change gradually over the course of 2018, because, even though the SEC continued to reject Bitcoin ETFs, dissenting voices from within the commission began emerging.\nThis was most in evidence in July, when the SEC\u00a0rejected \u2014 for a second time \u2014 the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust proposed for listing by the Bats BZX Exchange. Once again, it\u00a0judged that Bats' proposal failed to demonstrate that it was consistent with rules \"designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.\" However, it took the unusual step of adding a disclaimer to this rejection, writing, \"Although the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change, the Commission emphasizes that its disapproval does not rest on an evaluation of whether bitcoin, or blockchain technology more generally, has utility or value as an innovation or an investment.\"\nEven more significantly, Hester Peirce (now dubbed \u201cBitcoin Mom\u201d by the community)\u00a0dissented from this decision, despite being a commissioner at the SEC. On July 27, she\u00a0wrote:\n\"The disapproval order focuses on the characteristics of the spot market for bitcoin, rather than on the ability of BZX \u2014 pursuant to its own rules \u2014 to surveil trading of and to deter manipulation in the ETP shares listed and traded on BZX.\"\nThis open dissent from an SEC commissioner indicated a subtle turning of the tide in favor of Bitcoin ETFs. And while\u00a0one of the comments submitted during the brief SEC consultation in May was trenchantly hostile to the Winklevoss ETF,\u00a0most were supportive. More importantly, the supportive letters and comments didn't always come from people working directly within the crypto industry, with four companies operating within the global exchange-traded products market providing key testimony in favor.\nFor example, C&C Trading\u00a0concluded in its comment that it \"supports listing the COIN ETF and believes it will be an innovative product for investors and market professionals to trade,\" with the ETF market-making specialist also adding that many existing ETFs \"are based on opaque and illiquid underlying instruments.\"\nStill, despite the fact that wider industry and public opinion was in general warming to the idea of Bitcoin ETFs, 2018 unsurprisingly set the record for the number of proposals dismissed by the SEC. On Aug. 22 alone, the\u00a0commission rejected nine applications, with the likes of Direxion, ProShares and GraniteShares having their applications turned down (and in some cases, more than one application). And once again, the SEC\u00a0explained these rejections mostly in terms of a failure to prove that the applicants' rules were \"designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.\"\nThe fact that the commission remained fixed to this point of view shouldn't be surprising, not least because this decision followed soon after the publication of fairly damning research into crypto-market manipulation. In June, University of Texas researchers\u00a0released a paper concluding that Tether and Bitfinex manipulation was responsible for around 50 percent of Bitcoin's price rises in 2017. Barely a month before, the U.S. Department of Justice had\u00a0opened a criminal investigation into Bitcoin price manipulation, while, at the beginning of August, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0published a study that found that price manipulation was mostly being perpetrated by \u201ctrading groups\u201d using Telegram and other messaging services.\n2019: Increased hope despite decreased momentum\nIn light of all this negative publicity, it's unsurprising that the SEC continues to refuse the approval of a Bitcoin ETF. And while nothing has essentially changed in 2019 (and no ETF has so far been approved), there is once again increased cause for hope.\nIn February, Robert J.

The project is described as a blockchain-related identity that is able to launch both an ICO and a security token offering (STO), with the author of the posting claiming that the project was both audited by an investment firm and approved by several investment banks. Sponsy also claims to have a solid social presence, although its Twitter and Facebook page posts have around ten likes on average.

According to the company, the whisky will be tracked in collaboration with blockchain firm arc-net, which will develop the new products and a system to track manufacturing from distillery to store.

Goh has noted that, according to options traders, there is a five percent chance that Bitcoin will reach $10,000 by September of this year. The trader also noted that there is even a $20,000 call option for this June, but the probability of BTC reaching that price is zero, as it was likely a \u201cbullish trade that was made last year when investors were still discussing the short-term possibility of making new highs.\u201d\nFUD of the Week\nUS SEC Delays Decision on Bitcoin ETF Applications From VanEck and Bitwise\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has again delayed its decision on a rule change to the Securities Act that would allow the listing of Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETF). According to the latest notice, the SEC has extended the period to 90 days, after Bitwise\u2019s Feb. 15 application reached the end of its 45-day time period. According to the extension, the SEC must now reach a decision on the rule change by May 16, 2019. The two firms, NYSE ARCA and Bitwise, had announced their recent plans to launch Bitcoin ETFs in January, with the former intending to launch five separate ETFs linked to both bull and bear futures contracts on NYSE Arca.

Very few people expect the Bitcoin ETF to see the light of the day in 2019. Hence, even if it is not approved, the impact on crypto prices is likely to be limited. However, if the ETF is approved, it will be a pleasant surprise and will give a major boost to crypto prices.\nCurrently, the recovery is not led by Bitcoin: it is the altcoins that are dragging Bitcoin prices higher. Based on options data, traders are giving only a 5 percent chance for Bitcoin to reach $10,000 by September of this year. We believe that if the bulls succeed in breaking out of $4,255, the markets will start pricing in a greater probability of touching higher levels this year. Though we expect some sharp rallies during the year, we do not anticipate them to be similar to 2017.\nArgentina\u2019s deputy minister of finance, Felix Martin Soto, said that promoting crypto will reduce the demand for U.S. dollars in the Latin American nation and stabilize the local markets. Increasingly, nations are warming up to the vast potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. This will attract more investors to the asset class, as they see the transformation that the technology can bring about in their economies. Though slow in catching up, price will eventually follow fundamentals, and altcoins have been soaring in the past few weeks. Let\u2019s look at the best performers of the past seven days.\nXTZ/USDT\nTezos (XTZ) has been one of the stronger altcoins in the past few days, as its price has been buoyed by some fundamental events that brought cheers to the investors. The community has completed voting on the protocol proposal that will decide the upgrade of Tezos, and the proposal is now entering an Exploration Vote Period (or \u201cTesting_vote period\u201d). The markets also cheered the additional grant received by Cryptium labs to develop baking and consensus improvements for the Tezos core protocol.\nCoinbase Custody is offering staking services with Tezos (XTZ) to attract institutional players, wherein investors can make about 6.6 percent annual return and a client\u2019s assets will be kept in a cold storage at all times, making the process risk-free. The Tezos foundation intimated that PwC Switzerland has completed the 2017 statutory audit, and that the same has been filed with the Swiss Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations. PwC is also conducting the audit for 2018.\nWith these positive fundamental developments, can the rally continue or will it hit a roadblock? Let\u2019s find out. \u00a0\n\nThe XTZ/USDT pair traded in a tight range of about 16 weeks before breaking out to the upside. Last week, though the breakout of the $0.33-$0.654310 range could not be sustained, the pair has followed it with another up move this week. This shows a likely change in trend. In this up move, the digital currency has broken out of the 20-week EMA and can now rally to the 50-week SMA at $1.73. There is a minor resistance at $1.295480, but we expect it to be crossed.\nContrary to our assumption, if the bulls fail to scale $1.294580, the digital currency might consolidate for a few more weeks. The recovery will lose steam if the price plummets below $0.654310 once again. \u00a0\nADA/USD\nThe official arm of Cardano (ADA) announced that the popular Ledger Nano S now supports the cryptocurrency, which will help users hold their assets securely. Also, 19 Ethiopian and four Ugandans students graduated from IOHK\u2019s Haskell Course: these software developers will use blockchain technology to solve various problems in the Ethiopian agriculture industry. Charles Hoskinson, founder of IOHK, expects that in about three to five years, information can be moved between different systems, noting that the crypto industry is still waiting for the \u201cWiFi or Bluetooth moment.\u201d\n\nThe ADA/USD pair has extended its recovery with another strong week: it is now nearing the overhead resistance zone of $0.082952 to $0.094256. If the bulls scale this zone and the 50-week SMA that is just above it, a rally to $0.20 in the medium-term is possible. However, in the short-term, we expect $0.082952 to $0.094256 to act as a strong hurdle. A few weeks of consolidation close to this zone cannot be ruled out.\nOn the downside, any pullback is likely to find support at the 20-week EMA and below it at $0.051468. If the bulls fail to defend this support, the pair will again weaken.\nTraders who have purchased 50 percent of their desired allocation on our previous recommendation can continue to hold with the stop at $0.0350. We shall watch the price action for one more week and then suggest trailing the stops higher.\nEOS/USD\nEOS continues to hold the first position in the Chinese government-sponsored rankings of major cryptocurrencies, and Weiss Crypto Ratings gave a ranking of \u201cA\u201d to EOS for its challenge to Ethereum. As of January, 48 percent of DApps users were on EOS, way higher than the 28 percent on the Ethereum network. In another hack on the Bithumb exchange, more than 3 million EOS was transferred out from the exchange\u2019s hot wallet. Let\u2019s see how the price is reacting to this news.\n\nAfter consolidating for about four weeks, the EOS/USD pair has resumed its recovery. It will now again attempt to breakout of the overhead resistance at $4.4930. If successful, it can rally to $6.8299. The 50-week SMA is just below this level; hence, we expect $6.8299 to act as a major roadblock. But during the next pullback, if the pair manages to stay above $4.4930, it will indicate strength and will confirm that the markets have rejected the lower levels.\nFollowing a breakout above $6.8299, we expect the virtual currency to pick up momentum. Both the moving averages have flattened out and the RSI has risen to the midpoint: this shows that the selling pressure has reduced and a new uptrend is likely. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price fails to climb above $4.4930 and breaks below $3.8723.\nBNB/USD\nBinance announced a new lottery format for the next token sale on Binance Launchpad. This is a change from the first-come-first-serve basis that was used for the previous successful token launches. Binance has also partnered with risk management and compliance firm IdentityMind to improve data protection and compliance for Binance\u2019s global operations.

Actually, a really small proportion of the sponsors that I approached were willing to sponsor our event. So I had an idea to create a platform which would make it as easy as possible to organize sponsorship deals.\u201d\nThus, Komar decided to develop a platform that would facilitate sponsorship transactions and make them transparent.\n\u201cWe worked hard on developing tech, and we also had an idea to run a token sale to raise some money funding to facilitate and accelerate some software development efforts. However, we did not manage to raise a single dollar. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think that our product will be ever completed.\u201d\nDespite being advertised as a \u201cblockchain project,\u201d the platform\u2019s core component is actually centralized. \u201cIt works with a typical centralized server,\u201d Komar revealed during the conversation. \u201cBut we have some components which work on blockchain, and it would be easy for us to create some interpretability between the blockchain part and centralized part. It exists both in centralized and decentralized worlds.\u201d The Sponsy founder also told Cointelegraph that they developed some smart contracts on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain.\nAs Komar explained it previously to the Financial Times, his company missed the ICO boom of 2017, and no one became interested in its tokens later in 2018. The reason why they were so late, the young entrepreneur said, was his lawyer, who advised him to develop the actual product before launching an ICO \u2014 a decision Komar now seems to regret:\n\u201cWe would not have tried to build a product first, we would have tried to run a token sale as soon as possible, to jump into this crypto craze bandwagon and raise as much money as possible before building any product. And that\u2019s exactly what others were doing.\u201d\nWhile speaking to Cointelegraph, Komar described his lawyer as \u201ca reputable guy\u201d with many clients:\n\u201cI mean, at least none of his clients got into jail, so that\u2019s a good lawyer.\u201d\nDespite the legal advise, Komar actually attempted to hold an ICO at the start of 2018. According to the token sale website that he actively promoted in Sponsy\u2019s Telegram groups, SPONS tokens (basic ERC-20 tokens with no utility use) were being sold for $0.085 each during a private sale that started on Jan. 28 and ended on April 7. Since then, the tokens have been sold for $0.10 as part of the so-called presale, which is set to expire on May 1, 2019, according to the website.\nKomar confirmed that he attempted to sell tokens, but didn\u2019t agree that it could be classified as a token sale:\n\u201cThere was one person who bought some tokens for $10, so it can\u2019t be counted as an ICO.\u201d\nHe added that he failed to sell more mostly because of advertising-related difficulties:\n\u201cWe tried contacting a couple of media outlets to spread the word about our project, but nobody was interested to write about yet another ICO, because so many ICOs were failing. Those who agreed offered an insanely high price for press coverage.\u201d\nAndrew Hinkes, co-founder of Athena Blockchain and an adjunct professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and NYU School of Law, told Cointelegraph that a substantial amount of \u201c2016-2018 vintage ICOs\u201d were mostly offerings without compliance with securities laws and are therefore not viable in the United States, where sales of investment products are regulated by the state.\nNon-existent sponsors and unattended events\nThere are other inconsistencies with Komar\u2019s project. While there is indeed an iOS app available for downloading on the App Store, it appears to be quite undeveloped. Specifically, under the \u201csponsors\u201d tab, there are just three companies, two of which are Adidas and Coca-Cola.\nWhen asked whether Sponsy has signed any documents with the commercial giants, Komar replied negatively:\n\u201cNo, we haven\u2019t signed any legal partnerships with those companies. And the fact that you see those sponsors on the app is mainly because it was some sort of a test. Those Adidas and Bosch have nothing to do with real Adidas and Bosch.\u201d\nFurther, Sponsy\u2019s website claims that the startup has visited various blockchain conferences, but the titles of those events don\u2019t match up with their logos. Specifically, Sponsy claims to have attended San Francisco Blockchain Week, which is listed under the logo for BlockShow, a separate event powered by Cointelegraph. However, the BlockShow attendees\u2019 database shows no record of either Ivan Komar or Sponsy. Googling the title \u201cSponsy\u201d along with other events listed on the startup\u2019s website shows no relevant results.\nDuring the interview with Cointelegraph Komar, claimed that Sponsy did a roadshow \u201cacross San Paulo, Singapore and Hong Kong.\u201d The entrepreneur also complained that he was promised meetings with \u201ctop-notch investors\u201d there, but those turned out to be \u201crandomly selected people who had nothing to do with investment.\u201d\nFurther, the project claims to have a \u201csolid social presence,\u201d with over 10,000 likes on Facebook and 8,000 subscribers on Twitter. However, the Twitter page has only been updated twice a month since the company announced its forthcoming token sale last December, and the posts have around 10 likes on average. Sponsy has similarly maintained accounts on other social media, with posts randomly commented on by bot-like users, most of which describe how profitable and successful the project seems to be. Komar claimed that those are \u201ctotally real people.\u201d\n\u201cThey come from a program called \u2018bounty program.\u2019 It\u2019s very common among crypto startups. They are designed to spread the word about the project through those people who are commenting, liking, tweeting and stuff. But they [the participants] have no fantasy. I mean, they have poor English, mostly because they are based in Indonesia, Philippines and other poor Asian countries, and all they can do is write the same messages which do not make sense.\u201d\nThose people receive compensation for their efforts in the form of SPONS tokens, Komar clarified, adding:\n\u201cBut they are not going to make any real cash out of it, because we are selling our project. We did not manage to sell enough tokens or get on any crypto exchange. So, we can sympathize to [sic] those guys.\u201d\nWhen asked whether he felt responsible for that, the Sponsy founder said:\n\u201cNo, because either way they wouldn\u2019t have made cash out of it. It could be like one-two-three dollars, not any substantial amount of money. Even for Indonesia.\u201d\nFinally, Sponsy is described as a blockchain project that could launch both ICO and a security token offering (STO). The author of the offer claims that the project was audited by a United Kingdom-based law firm. The Financial Times reported that Komar was actually referring to a Poland-based company called Memorandum Capital, which claims to have its head office in Manchester. However, 132 other companies are listed at that address, according to Companies House Data, the publication established. A Google Maps search reveals that the firm\u2019s office is actually a residential house with satellite television.\nMoreover, the eBay listing states that the solutions developed by Sponsy comply with European Union and U.S. regulations.\nKomar told Cointelegraph that his startup had received all the documents required for holding a token sale from the same lawyer who advised him not to run an ICO before having developed any actual product. Launching an STO for his project, in turn, would require additional funding and documents, he said:\n\u201cWe decided to abandon those plans. But we believe that some person out there might be interested in this. That\u2019s why we wrote about the fact that the buyer could run an ICO or STO with our project.\u201d\nAndrew Hinkes informed Cointelegraph that, while a product or service can comply with a law that governs it without a piece of paper as evidence, there are complex regulatory issues surrounding fundraising, crypto and advertising:\n\u201cOf course, if a seller is making a false claim to induce a sale, there may be civil or criminal penalties associated with those claims. Potential investors should always conduct diligence on any investment opportunity prior to making an investment.\u201d\n\u201cI still expect that we will be able to negotiate the price\u201d: Will Komar actually sell his business on eBay?\nSomewhat ironically, Komar has finally got what he wanted: the public\u2019s attention. \u201cI Googled about other crypto startups selling on eBay and I realized that there was no competition in this regard,'' the entrepreneur said. \u201cI thought that this could potentially attract the attention of journalists and the media worldwide. And that\u2019s what seemingly happened.\u201d", "birthday": "2019-03-31T12:49:00+01:00", "date": "2019-03-31 11:49:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 31}
{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-implications-of-fusing-5g-and-blockchain", "title": " The Implications of Fusing 5G and Blockchain ", "content": "Analysts have been anticipating the implications of the Internet of Things (IoT) for several years. However, there have been two main impediments to its success: capacity and security.\nBut now, the introduction of a new technology could change that. This year, major carriers like AT&T and Verizon will be introducing 5G, the latest generation of cellular mobile communications. The 5G platform brings a high data rate, reduced latency, energy savings, cost reduction, higher system capacity and massive device connectivity, according to analysts.\nThe combination of 5G and blockchain technology has the potential to unleash a surge of economic value. In order to understand this connection between 5G and blockchain, one must think of the relationship as multifold. The power of 5G coverage through its reduced latency, high speeds and capacity allows for IoT devices to become widely used. Simultaneously, these devices can leverage the security, decentralization, immutability and consensus arbitration of blockchains as foundational layers.\nThat means smart cities, driverless vehicles, smart homes and other sensor-driven enhancements will finally have a technology that can handle their needs.\n\nAs foundational layers, blockchains can provide consensus and security while the majority of IoT transactions and contracts occur on second-layer networks, with the opportunity to settle payment channels and transaction disputes on-chain. The network capacity of IoT, however, will be enabled by the power of 5G coverage.\nFurthermore, 5G will directly assist blockchains by increasing node participation and decentralization, as well as allowing for shorter block times, driving forward on-chain scalability \u2014 all of which, in turn, further supports the IoT economy.\nHere is a first look at how 5G is rolling out and when real usage might be seen.\nThe rollout of 5G\nNetwork providers have started rolling out 5G within select United States cities, while global coverage is expected to come online in 2020.\nVerizon will start delivering its coverage in Chicago and Minneapolis from April 11, with services moving to 30 cities throughout the remainder of 2019.\nOn the vendor side, Samsung is expected to release its 5G-compatible Galaxy S10 model next month. Other companies, such as Huawei and LG, have announced models of their own that are expected soon.\nIn terms of modems, we are still waiting to see one that supports both 5G and LTE. Qualcomm is expected to release such a product, the X55, in either Q3 or Q4 of this year.\nApple consumers will have to hold off until 2020 before seeing a 5G-compatible iPhone, though, with the company apparently still evaluating market conditions.\nWaking up the Internet of Things\nThe benefits of 5G are its high speeds, capacity, low latency and ability to connect with vast numbers of devices. Latency refers to the time between when a signal is sent and received. In blockchain terms, latency is the time between a transaction being broadcast and it being received by nodes. However, for IoT, whether it be applied to smart homes or autonomous vehicles, achieving low latency is critical if devices are going to communicate with each other without experiencing long lag times.\nThis reduction could unlock another concept, the Internet of Skills (IoS). This is the process by which specialists conduct their work remotely through virtual reality headsets. For instance, a dentist would be able to perform procedures remotely. If latency cannot be minimized, then the specialist will not be responsive enough, endangering the patient and undermining the entire function.\nIt is these new applications that are driving the projections for the economic impact of 5G. A study from Qualcomm showed that 5G could lead to $12.3 trillion in additional global GDP by 2035.\nImportantly, 5G \u2014 with speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second \u2014 is an improvement to current home broadband services, as well as cellular networks. To put this in perspective, the average global, nonmobile internet speed stands at just 7.2 megabits per second. As such, 5G could well become the de facto internet network worldwide.\nThe effects of 5G on IoT and related concepts are going to be further augmented by multi-access edge computing. This is a form of networking whereby service is disseminated from centralized nodes to peripheral ones, resulting in an even greater increase to speeds while also reducing latency.\nIoT will rely on this capacity and ability for tremendous numbers of devices to connect with each other. It has been estimated that there could be as many as 100 billion IoT connections by 2025, according to research from Huawei, with growth likely turning exponential after that. \u00a0\nRamping up automation\nWhen talking about automation, it is typical to think in terms of robots replacing paid jobs currently done by humans. However, in reality, the scope of automation may eventually be far broader than this, including the replacement of chores and unpaid mundane tasks.\nThis can already be seen in the advent of smart homes, with domestic appliances communicating with each other, keeping stock levels and managing inventory. Autonomous cars and trucks are already moving past testing, with legislation being the main impediment.\nWithin the next decade, traditional industries \u2014 such as agriculture, mining and drilling \u2014 all anticipate automation through high-speed IoT, powered by billions of sensors and devices communicating over 5G.\nBottlenecks\nThese applications are dependent on extensive 5G coverage to provide the capacity, speeds, and latency required for these systems to perform as intended at a global scale.\nBut two other potential roadblocks toward 5G could present themselves.\nFirst, malicious devices could cause chaos within networks, empowered by their interconnectivity.\nSecond, the 5G rollout will encompass an explosion in transactions and payments between these devices. Such volumes will likely dwarf the current capacity of centralized and decentralized financial infrastructure.\nThe blockchain referee\nBlockchain innovations could likely solve the first problem. Public, decentralized blockchains are proficient at ensuring immutability, tamper-resistance and establishing consensus among distrusting entities.\nThus, they can be used as a foundational layer for settling disputes between IoT devices that cannot settle transactions or smart contract conditions. Since these devices can transact with money and operate vehicles, establishing an underlying protocol layer with robust security is paramount. Blockchains can excel at this.\nDecentralized blockchains offer further benefits over the current client-server model used in IoT. Their decentralized architecture means that identity can be protected and guaranteed. Currently, IoT devices identify themselves via cloud servers, with their identification data held in these databases. As such, the data can be compromised, stolen or imitated, presenting a major security threat to any application that runs atop such a network.\nBy using a decentralized blockchain, we can protect these identities through the use of asymmetric cryptography and secure hashing algorithms. Devices would be registered according to their own corresponding blockchain addresses, guaranteeing their identity. This blockchain layer can provide a level of security and frictionless identification unmatched by the existing centralized infrastructure.\nScaling up\nUnfortunately, the second problem of scale cannot be directly solved by blockchains. The sheer extent of IoT means that decentralized blockchain architectures are not capable of handling the necessary throughput. This is at least true on layer one \u2014 i.e., blockchains themselves.\nIt is both possible and preferable to defer the majority of transactions to layer two protocols like the Lighting Network that operate on top of blockchains, through the use of payment channels or sidechains. \u00a0\nHowever, given that every device will need to have its own address and on-chain transactions, there will need to be an on-chain capacity that reaches tens of thousands of transactions per second. In short, scalability must improve significantly on both layers.\nBlockchains such as Bitcoin Cash ABC, with block size increases, and Ethereum, through sharding, are building out far greater on-chain capacity. Simultaneously, we are seeing the steady progress of the Lightning Network as it rolls out, along with sidechains such as Liquid from Blockstream, while Ethereum\u2019s Plasma network continues to advance. The buildout of 5G and layer two blockchain infrastructure are fortuitously occurring simultaneously, providing the necessary scalability and coverage for an IoT-oriented economy.\nOne other route for system architects would be to add other structures, such as graphs between the base blockchain layer and IoT devices. Designs such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) can be used to achieve far higher throughput. However, this typically results in undermined security and decentralization.\nNavigating the trilemma of scalability, security and decentralization is a prerequisite to any blockchain-based IoT network, and deficiencies in any of these three areas could be cataclysmic for users and would undermine the purpose of using such a protocol in the first place. Until developers can produce alternative designs that achieve high throughput without sacrificing security or decentralization, IoT networks will have to use the more limited, yet secure blockchain structure.\nTamper-resistant data\n5G empowered IoT devices are set to drive a massive increase in data transfer. Cisco projects that they will generate 847 zettabytes by 2021. Although blockchains at their core are distributed data storage systems, it is unfeasible to store significant amounts of data on-chain. If this IoT data is not stored on-chain, though, this still leaves it open to attacks.\nHowever, it is quite possible to store hashes of data on-chain, with links pointing out to external data storage sites for the whole dataset. Indeed, such external storage could be run on other decentralized protocols, such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) or OrbitDB. While this does not guarantee the same level of tamper-resistance, it does offer a stronger level of security than centralized alternatives. Importantly, by storing hashes on-chain, any tampering of the data will result in a change in the hash, thus drawing attention to such an attack, along with a time record via the timestamp.\nEmpowering smart contracts", "birthday": "2019-03-30T23:24:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-30 23:24:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 30}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nBitcoin has closed in the green for the second consecutive month. This is the first such instance since December 2017, which indicates buying at lower levels. However, right now the action is in altcoins. Traders are piling on select altcoins and the positive sentiment is rubbing on to the leading digital currency. In the current recovery, Bitcoin\u2019s dominance has been steadily decreasing, which is now at 50.1 percent.\nTrading interest and volume in Bitcoin might pick up after the launch of Bakkt. Though there is no word on the launch date yet, Bakkt continues to build a strong team. It has announced Tom Noonan, former cybersecurity expert at IBM, Cisco and Endgame, as the chairman of its board of directors.\nDuring the bull phase, ICOs offer astronomical returns. But during a bear market, most of them take a huge beating. As a result, interest in ICOs diminishes. In Q1 of this year, the\u00a0ICO market could only raise $118 million, a far cry from the record $6.9 billion raised during Q1 of 2018. But as sentiment improves, this market could again come alive and projects with strong use cases should be able to raise money.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) is inching towards the overhead resistance of $4,255. The bulls have failed to break out of this resistance twice earlier, hence, we expect the bears to defend this level with full force.\nHowever, if the bulls scale above this level, it will complete a double bottom pattern and will also trigger a number of stops on the short positions. This will result in a quick move to $4,914.11, followed by a move to $5,273.91. The upsloping moving averages and RSI close to the overbought zone shows that the bulls are in command.\n\nOur view will prove to be wrong if the BTC/USD pair reverses direction from the current levels and drops below the moving averages. If the pair sustains below the 50-day SMA, a few more days of range-bound action can be expected. Traders can trail the stops on the long positions to $3,700.\nETH/USD\nThough Ethereum (ETH) closed above $144.78 on March 29, the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. However, the bullish sign is that the digital currency is trying to rebound from the 20-day EMA. If it can break out of $144.78 this time, a quick move to $167.32 is possible.\n\nThe ETH/USD pair will complete an ascending triangle pattern if it breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above $167.32. The pattern target of this bullish set up is $251.64. Both the moving averages are sloping up gradually and the RSI is also in the positive territory. This suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. Therefore, traders can retain the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $125.\u00a0\nXRP/USD\nThe traders are not showing any interest either in buying or selling Ripple (XRP). Therefor, the price has been idling around the current level for the past few days.\n\nA breakout of the overhead resistance at $0.33108 and the resistance line of the descending channel will be the first indication that the bulls are back in action. Following a breakout of the descending channel, the XRP/USD pair is likely to start a new uptrend that can carry it to $0.60. The ascend might face minor hurdles between $0.40 and $0.45 and above it at $0.50 to $0.55. However, we expect all these hurdles to be crossed. We might suggest long positions once again if the price sustains above $0.33108.\nConversely, if the pair turns down and plummets below $0.27795, it will indicate weakness. The next support on the downside is the yearly low of $0.24508. The downtrend will resume if this support also cracks.\nEOS/USD\nEOS is again facing stiff resistance at $4.4930, but it has not given up much ground like the previous instance on Feb. 24, when it plunged sharply after reaching the same level.\nWe expect the bulls to make another attempt to break out of the overhead resistance within the next 2\u20133 days. The next target to watch on the upside is $5.8370. The uptrending moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nOur bullish view will be negated if the EOS/USD pair turns down from the current levels and slips below both the moving averages. Therefore, traders can keep the stops on the remaining long positions at $3.70. We shall recommend booking partial profits again and trailing the stops higher within the next few days.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) is facing stiff resistance at $61.9044. Repeated attempts by the bulls to scale this level have failed. Traders can book profits on 40 percent of the remaining long positions above $60 and keep the stop loss on the rest at $55. We have suggested booking some more profits at current levels due to the failure of the bulls to rise above the resistance and the negative divergence on the RSI is making us uncomfortable.\n\nA fall below the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the LTC/USD pair is losing strength. We anticipate a deeper fall if the bulls fail to defend $56.910. Below this support, the level to watch on the downside is the 50-day SMA. Contrary to our expectation, if the bulls push the price above $62, a rally to $69.2790 will be in the cards.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has been consolidating in a tight range for the past four days. A breakout of $177.30 will complete a rounding bottom formation that has a pattern target of $249.60. Both the moving averages are trending up gradually and the RSI is trading close to the overbought zone. This suggests that the bulls are at an advantage.\n\nHowever, if the BCH/USD pair turns down from the current levels and plummets below the moving averages, it will lose momentum. The digital currency has a history of vertical rallies and waterfall declines. Hence, traders can protect their long positions with the stop loss at $140.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) has extended its fabulous run as it attempts to break out of the stiff overhead resistance at $18. If the bulls can sustain this level, there is no visible resistance until the price reaches near $25. This will bring the digital currency close to the lifetime highs and will be a big sentiment booster.\nWe like how every support is being held and the cryptocurrency has been making a higher floor for itself during the rise. Both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is close to the overbought one, which suggests that the bulls are firmly in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nTraders can keep the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $15. We shall trail this higher if we find signs of profit booking at the lifetime highs.\nOur bullish assumption will be invalidated if the BNB/USD pair fails to sustain above $18 and reverses direction. A fall below the 50-day SMA will indicate that the current leg of the up move is over.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) is struggling to break away from the 20-day EMA. The only positive is that the bulls have sustained above the 20-day EMA for the past five days. But if the price does not start an up move soon, it might face selling pressure again.\n\nA breakdown of the 20-day EMA can sink the XLM/USD pair towards the uptrend line. If this support also gives way, the trend will turn in favor of the bears.\nHowever, with both the moving averages gradually sloping up and the RSI in the positive territory, the path of least resistance is to the upside. We therefore suggest that traders hold the long positions with stops at $0.08.\nADA/USD\nCardano (ADA) came close to $0.075 level both on March 29 and 30. We recommended that traders book partial profits closer to this level in our previous analysis.\n", "birthday": "2019-04-01T21:07:00+01:00", "date": "2019-04-01 20:07:00", "year": 2019, "month": 4, "day": 1}

The government and India\u2019s Supreme Court have since wrestled with whether that ban is proper, holding hearings and postponing crucial decisions as debate ensued.\nNow the Supreme Court is set for a final hearing on the matter. They are then expected to issue a decision in the weeks following that meeting.\nBut the Indian street isn\u2019t waiting to make its feelings on the issue known. \u00a0\nAkshay Aggarwal, the co-founder of Blockchain India, an incubator for blockchain developers, noted that the protest crowds in all three cities presented a different flavor. While \u201call three presented intellect and rebellion,\u201d Delhi saw a crowd that didn\u2019t mind challenging the authority, while the people in Mumbai were more about showing that their time has value and that they wouldn\u2019t be spending time on blockchain if it had no basis. \u201cIt was more about money,\u201d Aggarwal said.\nHyderabad, however, witnessed a crowd that was open to a neutral discussion and was ready to consider both the pros and cons of cryptocurrencies, Aggarwal said.

Additionally, the sustained indecisiveness of the Indian government over crypto regulation has turned merchants accepting crypto payments sceptical of the legitimacy of digital money. This, in turn, has barred them from continuing to provide products and services in return for cryptocurrencies.\nThat has caused Indian businesses much agita, even among those who have previously embraced the crypto revolution.\nArunn Gupta is the co-founder of Startup Cafe in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh \u2014 the first co-working space in India to accept cryptocurrency payments.Last year, he watched the habits of the new business people who worked there and reached a decision.", "birthday": "2019-03-29T14:19:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-29 14:19:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 29}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nJapan is moving towards regulated crypto exchanges. The Japanese financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), has recently approved two entities to begin operations in April. Currently, only about 14 percent of the total 216 crypto exchanges around the world are licensed by regulators, according to the latest report by startup firm Coinfirm. \u00a0\u00a0\nRussian billionaire Vladimir Potanin is looking to create a cryptocurrency token backed by palladium that will improve the ease of transactions. The tokens will be traded through a Switzerland-based palladium fund. Similarly, blockchain-enabled diamond exchange Cedex will start operations by trading about 6,000 diamonds worth over $50 million. Another blockchain trust company Paxos wants to tokenize gold and expects to start operations this year.\nMany cryptocurrency investors are first-timers who have no experience with other asset classes. To tap into this set of investors who want to own some equity exposure, decentralized financial contracts platform UMA has partnered with Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) MakerDAO to release USStocks, a token tied to the U.S. stock markets.\nBlockchain and cryptocurrencies are attempting to make a difference in the way traditional assets are traded. If successful, it will be a bullish move for the nascent asset class. The recovery in crypto markets continues. Let\u2019s see which major coins look strong.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) has continued its journey toward of the overhead resistance of $4,255. The bulls have been struggling to scale this level since last December, hence, this is a major hurdle to watch out for.\nIf the digital currency breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above $4,255, it will complete a double bottom. This reversal pattern increases the probability of a new uptrend that has a minimum target objective of $5,273.91.\nBoth the moving averages are sloping up gradually and the RSI is in the positive zone. This shows that the buyers have the upper hand but the current up move lacks momentum. \u00a0\n\nContrary to our bullish view, if the BTC/USD pair fails to ascend $4,255, it will remain stuck in the large range of $4,255\u2013$3,236.09 for a few more weeks. After a sharp bear market, the bottoming formation is likely to take a long time. The longer the base, the stronger the eventual breakout from it will be.\nHowever, if the pair breaks down of $3,236.09, it will sour sentiment and can result in a waterfall decline. For now, traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions at $3,500. We shall soon trail the stops higher.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) is attempting to break out above the overhead resistance at $144.78. It has turned down from this level thrice in the past one month. Hence, this level assumes significance.\n\nIf the bulls push above the resistance at $144.78, the ETH/USD pair can quickly rally to $167.32. The pair might face a strong resistance at this level. Hence, we might tighten the stops when the price reaches $167.32.\nOn a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $167.32, the digital currency will complete an ascending triangle pattern. This bullish set up has a target objective of $251.64.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the price breaks below the uptrend line. The traders can keep the stops on the remaining long positions at $125\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) continues to trade near the moving averages. Both the averages are flat and the RSI is just below the midpoint. This points to a balance between the buyers and the sellers.\n\nThe balance will tilt in favor of the bulls if the XRP/USD pair breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above $0.33108. Just above this level is the resistance line of the descending channel. On rising above both these resistances, we expect the trend to change. The ensuing rally can reach $0.60 in the medium-term.\nConversely, if the bears sink the digital currency below $0.27795, it can plummet to the yearly low of $0.24508. We do not find any reliable buy setups at current levels; hence, we are not suggesting any trade in it.\nEOS/USD\nEOS has reached the critical overhead resistance of $4.4930 from where it had reversed direction on Feb. 24. Currently, the bulls are attempting to break out of the resistance. If successful, the digital currency can move up to $5.8370.\n\nBoth the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. This suggests that the bulls are in command and a breakout is likely. Still, as the price has reached a critical level, we suggest traders trail the stops on the remaining long positions to $3.70. We shall raise the stops again in a couple of days.\nContrary to our expectation, if the EOS/USD pair again reverses direction, it can fall to $3.8723, which should act as a strong support. The 20-day EMA is also close to this level, hence, this level assumes significance. The momentum will weaken if the price sustains below the 20-day EMA.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) has been consolidating near the highs for the past 13 days. This is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are not booking profits yet because they anticipate higher levels. The digital currency will extend the recovery if it breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above $61.9044. Following the breakout, a quick move to $69.2790 is probable.\nThe upsloping moving averages indicate that the path of least resistance is to the upside. However, the bearish negative divergence on the RSI can play spoilsport.\n\nA breakdown of the uptrend line of the developing wedge pattern is the first sign that momentum is waning. The first support on the downside is the 50-day SMA, below which the \u00a0LTC/USD pair can decline to $47.2460. Hence, please keep the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $55.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has broken out of $163.89 but might face some resistance at $177.30. If the bulls scale above this resistance, it will complete a rounding bottom pattern that has a target objective of $222.78\u2013$249.60.\n\nBoth the moving averages have started to trend up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. This suggests that the bulls have a slight edge. The BCH/USD pair has a history of vertical rallies, hence, we recommend holding the long positions with the stops at $140. The pair will weaken below $125.88 and will turn negative below $105.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) is currently consolidating in the $15.63\u2013$18 range for the past four days. This is a positive sign, as this confirms that the bulls are holding on to their long positions even at the critical overhead resistance of $18. Both the moving averages continue to trend up and the RSI is close to overbought territory.\n\nA breakout and close above the overhead resistance of $18 can carry the BNB/USD pair toward lifetime highs. This will be a big sentiment booster, as this will confirm that the recovery is on track and select digital currencies have started a bull market of their own.\nBut if the pair turns down from $18, it can correct to the 20-day EMA, below which the drop can extend to the 50-day SMA. Therefore, we suggest traders protect their remaining long positions with the stops at $15.\nXLM/USD\nThough Stellar (XLM) has been trading above the 20-day EMA for the past two days, it is yet to pick up momentum. This shows a lack of demand at higher levels.\n\nIf the XLM/USD pair does not move up within the next couple of days, it is likely to break below the 20-day EMA once again and drop to the uptrend line. This is a critical support, below which the trend will turn negative.\nContrary to our assumption, if the pair moves up sharply from the current levels, it can reach $0.13250273.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nVarious sectors are opening up to the vast potential of blockchain technology. This will result in a 44.5 percent compound annual growth rate in the blockchain space between now and 2025, according to a recent report. Spending in the space will purportedly increase from $3.12 billion to $41 billion in the said period.\nStill, there are a number of executives who are wary of this new technology. Aanchal Anand, a Land Administration Specialist in the World bank\u2019s Global Land and Geospatial Unit, has warned against the so-called \u201cblockchain hype.\u201d\nSimilarly, Catherine Bessant, chief technology officer at Bank of America (BoA) said that many companies approach her with blockchain projects, but she is yet to see a solid use case. Hence, she remains negative on the technology in her private capacity.\nWeiss Ratings founder, Martin D. Weiss, said that even during the bear market a critical segment of the crypto space is growing sharply. Therefore, \u201cfor those willing to take the risk, the best time to invest could be very near.\u201d Let\u2019s see what our charts project.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) dipped below the uptrend line on March 25, but the bulls bought the dips, which is a positive sign. The digital currency is currently attempting to scale above $4,065 and rally towards the overhead resistance of $4,255. A close (UTC time frame) above $4,255 will complete a bullish double bottom pattern, that has a target objective of $5,273.91. We also expect short covering above $4,255 to provide momentum, as a number of bears are likely to throw in the towel. The upsloping moving averages and RSI in positive territory suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nOur bullish view will be negated if the BTC/USD pair reverses direction from one of the above resistances and plummets below the uptrend line. On the downside, the first support to watch is the zone between uptrend line and 50-day SMA. If this breaks down, a fall to the critical support zone of $3,355 to $3,236.09 is probable. Therefore, traders can hold long positions with a stop loss of $3,500. We shall soon raise it to $3,800.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) corrected to the 50-day SMA on March 25 where buying emerged. The price has rebounded back above the 20-day EMA and is currently attempting to rise above the uptrend line. If successful, a move to $144.78 is probable.\n\nThe ETH/USD pair will pick up momentum above $144.78 and reach close to $167.32. On a breakout of this level, the index will complete an ascending triangle pattern, which has a target of $251.64.\nContrary to our assumption, if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks the 50-day SMA, it can correct to $125.88. A break below this will weaken the digital currency and drag it to $116.30. Hence, the stops on the remaining long positions can be kept at $125.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) plunged on March 25 and momentarily broke below the $0.27795 support, but it quickly recovered to close (UTC time frame) flat for the day. As we had suggested a stop just below $0.27795, we shall consider that the long positions were closed. If not, traders can keep the stop loss at $0.270.\n\nThe bulls are currently attempting to push the XRP/USD pair back above the moving averages. If successful, the pair is likely to move up to $0.33108. This is a critical resistance as it has not been sustained since Jan. 11 of this year. A breakout and close (UTC time frame) will indicate strength that can carry the price to the resistance line of the descending channel.\nIf the bulls can break out of the channel, a move to $0.40 is probable. The digital currency will pick up momentum above $0.40 and can reach $0.60. Therefore, we will again recommend buying on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.33108.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) dipped to the 20-day EMA where it found support. It is currently attempting to bounce off the support. If successful, it can move up to the resistance line and above it, the rally can stretch to $69.2790. Both the moving averages are sloping up, which shows that the buyers are at an advantage.\n\nContrary to our expectation, if the LTC/USD pair turns down from the current levels and plunges below the uptrend line of the developing wedge, it can drop to the 50-day SMA and below it to $47.2460. Therefore, traders can keep the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $55. We continue to watch the negative divergence on the RSI closely as it is a red flag.\nEOS/USD\nAfter trading close to the 20-day EMA for the past few days, EOS has made a decisive move to the upside. Considering the strength of the move, it can easily reach $4.4930 and even rise above it. If the price sustains above $4.4930, the next target to watch on the upside is $5.8370.\n\nHowever, if the EOS/USD pair fails to breakout of $4.4930, it can remain range bound for a few days. The pair will turn negative on a breakdown and close below the 50-day SMA.\nThe 20-day EMA has started to turn up and the 50-day SMA is sloping up. This a bullish sign and it increases the probability of an upward breakout of the overhead resistance. Therefore, traders can keep the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $3.1. We shall suggest trailing the stops higher in a couple of days.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) took support on the 20-day EMA on March 26 and is currently attempting to sustain above the overhead resistance of $163.89. We find a rounding bottom formation on the digital currency, which will complete on a close (UTC time frame) above $163.89. The target objective of this bottoming formation is $222.78.\n\nIf the bulls fail to sustain above $163.89, the BCH/USD pair can again fall to the 20-day EMA. If this support breaks, a fall to the 50-day SMA is probable. Traders can protect their long positions with the stops at $140. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI close to the overbought zone suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. With a history of vertical rallies, the pair can go to the upside.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) triggered our sell above $17. Hopefully, traders would have booked partial profits again on the open long positions. Now, only 25 percent of the original position remains. We did not recommend booking profits on the complete position because a breakout of $18 can result in a retest of the highs. Both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. This suggests that the bulls are still in command.\n\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the BNB/USD pair breaks below the uptrend line. Such a move can drag the pair to the 50-day SMA, below which the trend will turn negative. Therefore, we suggest traders keep a stop loss of $15 on the long position.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) dipped below the 20-day EMA on March 25, but quickly found buying support at lower levels. It is currently attempting to rise above the 20-day EMA once again.\n\nIf the price ascends $0.1130, it can move up to the resistance line at $0.13250273. Above this level, the next target to watch on the upside is $0.14861760.\nBut if the XLM/USD pair fails to sustain above the 20-day EMA, it can again correct to the 50-day SMA. The pair will turn negative if it breaks down of the uptrend line. Therefore, traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions at $0.08.\nADA/USD\nAs anticipated, the correction in Cardano (ADA) lasted only for two days. This is an indication of strength. Having hit our first target objective of $0.066121, the digital currency can now move up to its next target of $0.080.\n", "birthday": "2019-03-27T22:25:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-27 22:25:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 27}

Currently, Bitcoin supports less than 7 transactions per second with a 1 megabyte block limit.\u201d\nAchieving Visa-like volume on the Bitcoin network seemed barely possible, given that handling that kind of bandwidth and storage would require a great amount of computing power. However, Poon and Dryja argued, there is a way to make Bitcoin a feasible alternative to existing payment systems while keeping its signature decentralization and security \u2014 and that would be off-chain scaling.\nEnter LN, a network of off-chain payment channels, which require almost no fees and allow for fast, seamless transactions that are made on a layer above the actual blockchain.\n\u201cWith an off chain payment channel you can deposit, for instance, $100 once, and pay network fee for it, and then pay to your favorite shop as many times as you wish, without paying any transaction fees to the network, to the sum of $100,\u201d explains Eyal Shani, a blockchain researcher at consulting group Aykesubir. He added:\n\u201cInstead of paying a transaction and sending it to the entire network, you send an encrypted and signed \u2018promise\u2019 that you owe that other party, say, $10 out of the $100. Finally, if the paid party needs the money for another purpose, they close the channel by sending the promise to the entire network. Theoretically, you can do millions of transactions for the price of twice the network fee.\u201d\nThat way, users can conduct numerous transactions outside of the blockchain and then, when they\u2019re done, record them as a single one, hence saving a lot of processing for the ledger. To describe how the channels work in greater detail, Shani makes an analogy with buckets of water, emphasizing one of its main shortcoming along the way:\n\u201cWhen you deposit money on it, you're filling the bucket and then when you spend it, it slowly loses that water. The bucket can also be full, as you can't have too much water in it. Because of this, for example, once you open a LN channel, you cannot receive money right away \u2014 your bucket is full, and first you have to spend some. However, based on the fact that you want to transfer (usually) money from A to D, via the channels of B and C along the wayit is a real problem to keep everyone\u2019s channel with enough liquidity (i.e, balance) to make the transfer.\u201d\nAlthough the LN has been designed specifically for Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, Shani adds, the concept can be performed on other blockchains \u2014 for instance, there is the Raiden network created for Ethereum (ETH).\nMoreover, as Cointelegraph reported in a more in-depth analysis of the LN, the network is also testing the so-called cross-chain atomic swaps, which are basically transfers of tokens between different blockchains. If properly implemented, this feature could allow to quickly \u2014 and with little to no fees \u2014 swap any given cryptocurrency to a different one, and hence challenge the use of cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThe Lightning Torch \u2014 from a local flash mob to a powerful movement co-signed by the CEO of Twitter\nThe Lightning Torch, also known as LN Trust Chain, is a community-driven experiment aimed at raising awareness about the protocol and testing its robustness.\nIt was launched on Jan. 19, when Twitter user and Bitcoin enthusiast Hodlonaut announced he or she was willing to pass on 100,000 Satoshis (the smallest unit of a Bitcoin) via the LN to the first person who seems reliable. That volunteer would have to add another 10,000 Satoshis and send the whole amount to another person willing to participate, and so on.\nThe process somewhat resembles the Olympic torch relay, hence the name \u201cthe Lightning Torch.\u201d Eventually, the hashtag #LNTrustChain began circulating to ease communication among community members involved in the experiment, giving the movement an additional boost on social media.\n\u201cThe experiment got traction pretty fast among my little twitter bubble. First 100 passes took less than a week.\u201d Hodlonaut tells Cointelegraph over Twitter DMs. \u201cI think busiest day may actually have been the first day, January 19, with more than 20 passes. The pace of passing has decreased with time, mainly because people are trying to make passes to specific people instead of just sending to one of the invoices sent to them on twitter.\u201d\nAs of press time, the torch has been carried by more than 240 people in 52 different countries. The list of participants includes, among others, a 88-year-old grandmother of a crypto enthusiast, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, financial derivatives giant Fidelity Investments, LinkedIn co-founder and former PayPal Chief Operating Officer Reid Hoffman and Monero (XMR) Core developer Riccardo Spagni, who passed the torch while inflight.\n\u201cI was excited about LN, and wanted to have some fun/experiment with it.\u201d Hodlonaut recalls. \u201cI was curious to see how far something like that could go. Didn't expect it to last very long or get much attention\u2026 So the @jack thing was pretty mindblowing\u201d\nInitially, Hodlonaut says, his or her goal was to simply spread awareness about the LN and its potential use. He or she has been interested in the protocol since the testnet days, but it was in September 2018 when Hodlonaut finally set up their own node using RaspiBlitz\u2019s instructions. Hodlonaut continued:\n\u201cWhy I got interested is because the instant nature is so fascinating. To be able to send fractions of bitcoin instantly like this was mind blowing in the same way my first transactions on-chain after discovering Bitcoin in 2013.\u201d\nEven though the LN community has appeared overall trustful and cooperative, there have been a few bumps in the road.

They're a tricky business at the best of times, but when conducted in a nascent industry in which regulations, guidelines and best practice haven't been firmly established, they can be absolutely perilous. Just ask Coinbase, which acquired blockchain analytics startup Neutrino in February for what turned out to be a fee of $13.5 million. This seemed all fine and dandy at the time, but it soon emerged that founding members of Neutrino's staff had links to Hacking Team, an Italian software firm that had controversially sold surveillance tools to international law enforcement agencies and even to authoritarian governments (e.g., the United Arab Emirates).\nGiven that crypto prides itself on helping individuals escape the overbearing control of centralized institutions, it would be an understatement to affirm that this merger \u2014 once the above details were made public \u2014 didn't go down too well with the wider community. Indeed, the merger created a public relations nightmare for Coinbase, which hurried doggedly to wash its soiled image (largely by affirming that ex-Hacking Team staff will \"transition\" out of their new roles at the exchange giant).\nYet, more broadly, this episode has also raised the wider issue of mergers and acquisitions (M&As), particularly as they relate to and occur within the cryptocurrency industry. That's because Coinbase is one of the largest companies in the industry, and seeing as how even it couldn't quite exercise enough due diligence in this case, it begs the question of what other players in the space are doing when they merge with or acquire other companies.\nThis question becomes all the more urgent when it's recognized that 2018 set a new record for the industry, with $559 million being spent in the United States alone on mergers and acquisitions. However, lawyers specializing in M&As explain that there are a number of things shareholders can do in serious cases of mismanagement, while it's also clear that mergers are another area that will improve for the industry as it becomes more mainstream and regulated.\nDue diligence\nWhat makes the Coinbase incident particularly interesting is that the San Francisco-based exchange was aware of Neutrino's links to Hacking Team prior to the acquisition. In other words, the failure of the company to perform \u201cdue diligence\u201d didn't fall specifically on finding out about these links, but on recognizing that such links would be viewed negatively by Coinbase's customers and by the wider cryptocurrency community.\nAs a Coinbase spokesperson told Motherboard at the end of February:\n\"We are aware that Neutrino\u2019s co-founders previously worked at Hacking Team, which we reviewed as part of our security, technical, and hiring diligence.\"\nSo once again, the oversight didn't relate to awareness of Neutrino's affiliations, but to awareness of how such affiliations violate the values of people likely to trade, own and use cryptocurrency. And in some ways, this is a more serious failure than simply not knowing about Hacking Team, since it indicates a startling lack of understanding of crypto on Coinbase's part and intimates that its values possibly don't align with the majority of people who involve themselves with the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nAnd the question is, did people at Coinbase really not ask themselves how the links between Neutrino and Hacking Team would be perceived by the general crypto public?\nWell, according to a blog written in early March by the exchange's CEO, Brian Armstrong, they didn't.\n\"However, we had a gap in our diligence process,\" he wrote. \"While we looked hard at the technology and security of the Neutrino product, we did not properly evaluate everything from the perspective of our mission and values as a crypto company.\"\nThis raises a further question: Should companies undertaking mergers or acquisitions perform due diligence in the areas of values and public image? According to Rocket Lawyer founder and CEO Charley Moore, this is something they generally do anyway, regardless of whether they should. \"Yes, businesses typically place high value on their reputations and good will,\" he told Cointelegraph, although he also explained that the level of due diligence can vary according to the companies involved and the type of merger they are pursuing:\n\"First, it\u2019s important to note that all combinations of businesses are not the same. In fact, there are many different ways to combine two or more companies, to accomplish sometimes competing goals, like limiting liability, retention of employees and/or managing tax consequences. Having said that, the level of diligence or, 'scrutiny' may vary, depending on the type of combination being executed. Regardless, some level of scrutiny is typical in most cases.\"\nThis appraisal is seconded by other lawyers experienced in M&As. Gerald Brant is a partner at Akin Gump, and like Charley Moore, he notes that the appropriate amount of scrutiny can vary from case to case. \"In general, you can't say that one company should always exercise the same amount of due diligence when acquiring another,\" he said.\nBrant also told Cointelegraph that determining how a merger might reflect on a company's publicly declared \u201cvalues\u201d can be a tricky business, although corporations generally do consider what an acquisition is likely to mean from a marketing perspective. \"It's hard to assess how an acquisition could reflect on a company's values, since these can be vague and ill-defined,\" he explained. \"But most firms will look at the marketing and reputational implications, and whether the two companies are a good fit in terms of corporate culture.\"\nRedress\nIt therefore seems that Coinbase may have deviated from ordinary company practice in not considering the Neutrino merger \"from the perspective of our mission and values as a crypto company,\" as Brian Anderson put it. However, assuming that a company has failed to carry out due diligence and that a merger has reflected badly on its reputation, two more questions remain. Firstly, where does the blame lie for a mishandled acquisition? And secondly, what can shareholders or stakeholders do in the event of a \u201cbad\u201d merger affecting a company's subsequent performance?\nAccording to Gerald Brant, despite each case needing to be evaluated on its own terms, it\u2019s normally the case that responsibility lies with more than just the chief executive.\n\"The fault usually lies with everybody involved in the merger,\" he said. \"The CEO, the board, and the advisors.\"\nStill, given that it was Brian Armstrong who wrote the apologetic blog following the Neutrino acquisition, it would seem he took ultimate responsibility for the purchase and for not sufficiently considering how it would look to the outside world. That said, even if Armstrong has published a mea culpa, it's not certain just what anyone with a stake in Coinbase could do to redress any harm that's been caused to the value of the company. As Charley Moore said, \"Shareholders may bring a variety of legal actions based on multiple potential theories, including breach of contract and civil or criminal statutes,\" yet the fact is that Coinbase hasn't breached any contract in completing the Neutrino acquisition and neither has it violated any criminal statutes.\nStill, seeing as how M&As are growing part of the crypto industry, it's worth getting a handle on what shareholders could do in other, hypothetical cases. And according to Dan Zimmerman, a senior counsel at Akin Gump, they do have the option of legal action, although this is normally limited \u2014 as a practical matter \u2014 for serious cases where a decline in share price and company value can be demonstrated as having followed from a merger or acquisition.\n\"Shareholders do have the option of bringing fiduciary duty claims against a company if a merger goes badly,\" he said. \"However, being successful in a claim against a company\u2019s directors is made less likely by the difficulty in pointing to an objectively measurable change in the share price and reputational harm following an acquisition.\"\nIn the case of reputational harm, Zimmerman also explains that shareholders would have a better chance of success if they could prove that the directors hid material information when completing an acquisition. This is something that didn't appear to happen with Coinbase and Neutrino, although that's not to say it couldn\u2019t happen in the crypto industry in the future. However, because most crypto-related companies aren't publicly listed, it won't always be possible for shareholders or stakeholders to pursue litigation. If an individual's \u201cshares\u201d in a company amount only to the crypto tokens of that company, and if such tokens are not considered to be securities, for example, then there isn't much he or she could do under U.S. securities law.", "birthday": "2019-03-28T17:56:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-28 17:56:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 28}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/changes-to-tethers-terms-of-reserves-raises-fresh-concerns", "title": " Changes to Tether\u2019s Terms of Reserves Raises Fresh Concerns ", "content": "Controversial stablecoin Tether is in the spotlight again after changes to the details of the way in which it backs up tokens in supply.\nAs reported on March 14, various online users noted and posted disconcerting changes to the Tether website, which have seemingly altered the way that the company is providing surety for the tokens it issues.\nTether is a stablecoin backed up by the United States dollar at a 1:1 ratio, meaning the company has $1 for every USDT that is in circulation. This has long been a point of contention by the wider cryptocurrency community due to the fact that Tether has never carried out a third-party audit of its financial accounts.\nWhile the exact date of the change is not known, Tether\u2019s website has seemingly adjusted the details of how it ensures a reserve for circulating tokens, with the \u201c100% Backed\u201d statement no longer claiming that every USDT is backed by fiat currency:\n\u201cEvery tether is always 100% backed by our reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities.\u201d\n\nIt is the latest twist in Tether\u2019s chequered history, which Cointelegraph has delved into at length.\nDebatable assurances of reserves\nThe company\u2019s latest attestation of its financial accounts is a document from law firm Freeh, Sporkin & Sullivan LLP, which provided confirmation of Tether\u2019s currency reserves in 2018.\nA number of clauses near the end of the document make the assurances unsubstantial.\nFirstly, Freeh, Sporkin & Sullivan is not an accounting firm, and did not make the confirmations using generally accepted accounting principles. The document also makes it clear that the confirmation should not be construed as the result of an official audit.\nThe findings are also only seen as being valid as of June 2018, meaning the company still has not provided third-party assurance of reserves for circulating currency for over nine months.\nTether also had to carry out a search for another banking service provider following its split with Puerto Rico-based Noble Bank in October 2018. The company provided proof of banking with Bahamas-based Deltec Bank in November.\nFollowing this, a report from Bloomberg in December 2018 claimed that the company did indeed have the necessary cash reserves in its new bank accounts.\nAll the while during this period, USDT struggled to hold its 1:1 peg with the US dollar, as its value dipped below the $1 mark. This set off waves of fresh controversy, as the cryptocurrency struggled to retain its stablecoin status.\nIt is worth noting that Tether is not the only stablecoin that has struggled to maintain its 1:1 peg to the US\u00a0dollar.\nThe Dai (DAI) stablecoin, which is also backed by the US dollar, has dipped below the $1 mark on various exchanges, prompting developers to propose a hike in fees in order to maintain its peg.\nIndustry experts raise concerns of fractional reserve\nWith the cryptocurrency community raising the alarm bells around Tether\u2019s change in reserve policy, industry experts have also joined in and given their take on the situation.\nTuur Demeester, a renowned cryptocurrency investor and analyst, provided a some a number of tweets, unpacking what he described as a slippery slope to Tether operating a fractional reserve system:\n\u201cSlippery language by Tether. \"100% backed\" <=> \"may also include receivables from loans issued\". Imo this is a clear transition from full to fractional reserve banking.\u201d\n\u201cNote how Tether's comment that their reserves \"may also include other assets\" opens the door to backing by virtually anything, with fuzzy valuation assumptions. Would be helpful to at least see more details from the contractual fineprint.\u201d\nReplying to questions from Cointelegraph, Demeester said in an email the main concern was how Tether would be investing some of its reserves and the liquidity of those assets in order to satisfy the potential redemption of a large amount of tokens at any given time:\n\u201cI can only speculate, but based on USDT currently trading almost at par with USD, I would venture a guess that at this moment Tether does have adequate cash reserves to survive a \u201crun on the bank.\u201d My concern is mainly about the precedent that this change in the terms is setting: it opens the door to potentially start investing Tether\u2019s reserve in assets that are illiquid or hard to value.\u201d\nXDex analyst and crypto-podcast host Fernando Ulrich also weighed in on the controversial changes to Tether\u2019s website. In a lengthy Twitter thread, Ulrich unpacked his views on fractional reserve banking and how Tether\u2019s operations should be cause for concern.\nWriting directly to Cointelegraph, Ulrich\u2019s focus was not on whether Tether has the necessary reserves for circulating USDT, but the quality and nature of these reserves:\n\u201cI do believe Tether has 100% of reserves for issued tokens. But again, that\u2019s not the problem, the problem is the quality of these reserves. Are they made of 50% Treasury-Bills, 30% bank certificate of deposits, and 20% receivables? Or is it 99% Treasury-Bills? We don\u2019t know, and therein lies the problem. It\u2019s the quality of reserves, not the quantity.\u201d\nAnother point of concern raised over the past two years is Tether\u2019s connection to cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. The companies share\u00a0some of the same leadership, including CEO JL van der Velde.\nThere have been allegations that Bitfinex issued Tether tokens over the past few years effectively on credit. Ulrich believes this could have serious ramifications for the cryptocurrency market, if people are using USDT to buy other cryptocurrencies.\n\u201cI do find it concerning, especially because the possibility of issuing tokens on credit results in liquidity that can affect prices in the short-term. Furthermore, it may put Tether in an illiquidity situation, possibly causing a run on its reserves. Given that their main exchanges (by average daily volume) rely on USDT for its BTC/USD trading pair, it can surely affect these markets. The whole thing may cause turbulence for the crypto markets in the short-term.\u201d\nBitfinex went as far as threatening legal action against various social media commentators in December 2017 that were speculating about the relationship between these two companies.\nTether refutes claims\nTether\u2019s general counsel Stuart Hoegner responded to Cointelegraph\u2019s request for comment on a number of issued raised by various members of the wider community.\nFirst, Hoegner stated that Tether\u2019s reserve includes cash, cash equivalents, and other assets,\u00a0while maintaining that these reserves are equal to or greater than the amount of USDT in circulation.\nHoegner declined to elaborate on the type of assets that the company would be using as reserves, but said the decision to change its reserve policy was a result of the changing stablecoin landscape:\n\u201cWe generally do not comment on the specific composition of our reserves, but this change in optionality reflects the growth of Tether and the growth of the stablecoin industry -- and attendant, non-demand account options -- more generally.\u201d\nWhen asked to comment on claims that Tether does not have reserves equal to the amount of USDT in circulation, Hoegner asserted that the company did have necessary reserves and was openly transparent about its holding on its website:\n\u201cTethers remain completely stable and 100% backed, so Tether\u2019s reserves always equal or exceed the number of issued Tethers. Moreover, our reserves are posted in real time on Tether.to.\u201d\nHe was also asked if and when Tether would carry out a third-party audit of its accounts. Hoegner said Tether\u2019s website provided a transparent account of its reserves - which it deems adequate.\n\u201cTether operates as transparently as possible. We publish the value of our reserves daily, and provide 24/7 access to our bank balance and value of reserves.\u201d\nCritics\u2019 claims that Tether is also operating a fractional reserve system was also refuted by the company. Hoegner stated that Tether does not have a banking business lending reserve amounts to retail customers.\n\u201cTether's reserves remain, and have always been, 100% backed by its reserves. Tether maintains the ability to honour all redemption requests.\u201d\nIn his replies to Cointelegraph, Xdex\u2019s Ulrich said that these claims by Tether cannot truly be trusted until an official third party audit is carried out:\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to confirm it without an audited financial statement from a reputable firm. We can only speculate. What I can say is that the updated terms of service opens the possibility for that to happen. From now onwards, Tether can issue tokens on credit and the \u201coutstanding receivable\u201d may serve as reserves for issued tokens. Furthermore, it isn't clear the extent to which such reserves can be used. Would it be possible to have 10% of reserves as receivables? 50%? 90%? What about the maturity of receivables? Only up to 30 days or even longer? The terms of service don\u2019t make it clear. So my guess everything is possible, and that should be a cause of concern for holders of USDT.\u201d\nUlrich also brings up an interesting point regarding the major holders of USDT and what situations could test the liquidity of Tether and its reserves.\nA potential acid test would require a large amount of USDT token holders to ask for redemption of their tokens, which would force Tether to prove its liquidity.", "birthday": "2019-03-24T18:54:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-24 18:54:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 24}

According to research by the British property firm Savills, the world\u2019s real estate was worth a combined total of $280 trillion in 2017 \u2014 an increase of 6.2 percent on the year before. Residential properties accounted for most of this record-breaking amount, with commercial and agricultural real estate comprising the rest.\nDGTO is going to offer a web-based platform that would enable users to participate in security token offerings for the real-world assets being migrated to blockchain. Darico believes this opens up the possibility for crypto enthusiasts to own a fraction of an apartment \u2014 giving them options only available to high net worth individuals beforehand.\nA tokenized world\nDarico, which launched in 2016, says DGTO will join its ecosystem of five products successfully being developed. The tokenization platform is going to have strong ties with its DAREX exchange, enabling the new security tokens created by businesses to be traded \u201ceffortlessly\u201d on a secondary market.\nAs Cointelegraph reported back in November 2018, the digital asset exchange boasts a hybrid model which allows users to trade utilities and securities, with token holders receiving a share of the revenue generated by these transactions.", "birthday": "2019-03-25T10:55:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-25 10:55:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 25}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/wine-mountains-and-mining-rigs-georgia-as-a-crypto-powerhouse", "title": " Wine, Mountains, and Mining Rigs: Georgia as a Crypto Powerhouse ", "content": "The former Soviet republic of Georgia, which occupies picturesque mountain valleys and rugged ridges of the Southern Caucasus, has roughly the same population as the state of Connecticut. It is renowned as the birthplace of Joseph Stalin, as well as for being one of the oldest wine regions in the world, its rich and eclectic cuisine, and, more recently, for hosting the world\u2019s third-largest cryptocurrency mining operation.\nAdditionally, an estimated 5% of the nation\u2019s households are engaged in mining crypto or invested in it. Back in 2016, the Georgian government was the first to create an operational blockchain-powered system for property rights registration, which by mid-2018 had hosted more than 1.3 million electronic documents. State officials are now looking to move all government registries to distributed ledgers.\nSounds like crypto-buff\u2019s dream, doesn\u2019t it? For a small nation, though, the place in the front row of fintech pioneers comes at a cost. A single entity, the Netherlands-based blockchain software and hardware provider Bitfury, is responsible for much of Georgia\u2019s current crypto momentum. The company chose to cast anchor in the Alazani Valley for the friendly investment climate and abundance of hydropower on which it heavily relies. However, critics among the Georgian political opposition think that Bitfury was able to negotiate excessively favorable terms with the government, leading to diminished tax revenues and even increase in electricity tariffs nationwide.\nThe warm welcome\nBitfury Group was founded in 2011 by a Latvian entrepreneur Valery Vavilov, whose bio on the company\u2019s website mentions his first-hand experience with the \u201cchallenges resulting from the collapse of the Soviet Union.\u201d Although the company is incorporated in Amsterdam, the natives of the post-Soviet space are heavily represented among its leadership. Apparently, Bitfury\u2019s \u0421-suite were quite familiar with both the challenges and opportunities that the region presents, as well as with ins and outs of doing business in the area.\nVavilov first arrived in Georgia to talk business in 2013; in July 2014, Bitfury\u2019s first 20 megawatt data center emerged in the eastern Georgian city of Gori. In December of the following year, a major expansion nearly tripled the company\u2019s mining capacity in the country, as Bitfury deployed its 16 nm ASIC chips at a new facility in the area called Gldani, within the city limits of the capital, Tbilisi. This outpost became the first resident of the newly developed Free Industrial Zone, which was designed to attract technology companies by perks such as an exemption from the 18% value-added tax (VAT). The company purchased 18 hectares of land for a symbolic price of 1 lari, which amounts to a fraction of $1. The new data center\u2019s featured a new proprietary cooling technology: Its computers were submerged in tanks of nonconductive fluid while racing to seal the block.\nAs Bitfury arrived in 2014, the Georgian Co-Investment Fund, linked to the country\u2019s wealthiest person and former Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, provided the firm with a $10 million installation allowance, according to The New York Times. Although both Bitfury and Ivanishvili\u2019s representatives have repeatedly stated that the loan has been repaid even before the Gldani facility opened, the rumors of the billionaire remaining one of the main beneficiaries of the project never subsided. At any rate, the two entities maintained at least an interlocking directorate connection, as Bitfury\u2019s board member George Kikvadze held a senior office with the Co-Investment Fund and had stepped down from the GCIF in 2015, according to a Bitfury spokesperson speaking to Cointelegraph.\nThe relationship between the government and the mining behemoth briskly progressed, and in April 2016, Valery Vavilov and the chairman of the National Agency of Public Registry made public their plan to create a blockchain-powered land registry system. The following year, Georgia made history in becoming the first nation to implement distributed ledger technology for securing and validating government records.\nIn February 2018, Bitfury announced that it was selling the Gldani data center to Chong Sing Holdings, a Hong-Kong based fintech company, citing the need to continue its \u201csuccessful expansion in the Asian market of both hardware and software solutions.\u201d However, in just a few months, the facility went back under the original proprietor\u2019s control: Amid plunging prices and increasing regulatory pressures in China, Chong Sing found itself rushing to hedge its risks and cut down exposure to crypto assets. Bitfury was able to get the Gldani facility back at a discount. Despite the lingering bear market, the company still reports profit and remains bullish on Bitcoin in the long run.\nThe Bitcoin dream\nWhether it was due to Bitfury raising the profile of the mining enterprise or people being able to figure it out regardless, the ordinary Georgians have had their fair share of the crypto craze. Hundreds of thousands of rigs joined the race before the market went steeply downhill, driving the share of mining in Georgia\u2019s electricity bill to a staggering range between 10% and 15%. Despite the government\u2019s general blockchain-friendly, low-regulation stance, toward the end of 2017, financial authorities grew concerned with the scale of the gold rush and had to remind Georgians that Bitcoin was still not a legal tender, and recommend to exercise caution when staking their livelihood on crypto.", "birthday": "2019-03-25T11:53:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-25 11:53:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 25}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\n\u041carket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nDuring a meeting with the president of Argentina, American venture capital investor Tim Draper spoke about the potential of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. He also urged the president to legalize Bitcoin to help the nation emerge out of the economic crisis. Later, during an interview, Draper said that he expects Bitcoin to reach $250,000 by 2022 and 2023. If crypto becomes easy to use, he expects people to ditch fiat and opt for Bitcoin.\nBut for now, companies are finding it difficult to use cryptos as a mode of payment. The latest to ditch cryptos is Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch. The company has not mentioned any specific reason for the decision.\nPopular stablecoin Tether recently changed its previous claim that every token in circulation is \u201c100 percent Backed\u201d with fiat currency. It now states that each token is backed by \u201ctraditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities.\u201d This has raised a red flag as Tether has not offered itself for a third-party audit.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) has been trading close to $4,000 for the past few days. This small range trading is unlikely to continue for long. We anticipate a large range move within the next few days.\n\nIf the range expands to the upside, the BTC/USD pair can rally to $4,255. This is a major resistance, above which the pair will complete a double bottom pattern, that has a minimum target objective of $5,273.91.\nHowever, if the range expands to the downside, the digital currency can fall to the 50-day SMA. If this support also gives way, the next support to watch on the downside is $3,355.\nThe 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is just above the center, which points to a consolidation in the near term. Traders can retain the stop loss on the long positions at $3,550. As the bulls failed to scale above the psychological barrier of $4,000, we will trail the stops higher within the next few days.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) has broken down of the 20-day EMA and the uptrend line. Its next support is at the 50-day SMA below which a fall to $125.88 is probable. If this support also breaks, the digital currency will lose momentum. Therefore, traders can retain the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $125.\n\nContrary to our expectation, if the price finds support at the 50-day SMA and reverses direction, it will again try to break out of $144.78. If successful, the ETH/USD pair can rise to $167.32.\nHowever, the 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has also dipped below 50, which points to a consolidation.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) has broken down of the uptrend line and has moved away from the moving averages. This shows that the bears have the upper hand. A break below $0.30 can drag the price to $0.29 and below it to $0.27795. This is a critical support that has held since December of last year. A breakdown of this can result in a retest of the yearly low.\n\nContrary to our expectation, if the XRP/USD pair rebounds from the current levels or from one of the supports on the downside, it will again try to rise above the overhead resistance of $0.33108. We anticipate a strong move if the price sustains above the resistance line of the descending channel. For now, traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions below $0.27795.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) continues to face selling close to the resistance line. On the downside, the bulls are providing support at the 20-day EMA. The RSI is still showing a negative divergence, which is a red signal. A breakdown of the 20-day EMA and the uptrend line of the developing wedge will increase the probability of a fall to the 50-day SMA. Therefore, traders can trail the stop loss on the entire remaining long positions to $55.\n\nHowever, if the LTC/USD pair rebounds from the 20-day EMA, it will again try to breakout of the resistance line and rally to its next target objective of $69.2790. Both the moving averages are sloping up, which shows that the bulls still have the upper hand. We expect a decisive move within the next few days.\n\nEOS/USD\nThe bulls are struggling to hold the 20-day EMA. A failure to bounce off this level increases the probability of a breakdown and a fall to the 50-day SMA, which might hold. With the 20-day EMA flattening out and the RSI close to 50, EOS is likely to become range bound for a few days.\n\nIf the bears sink the EOS/USD pair below the 50-day SMA, it can fall to $3.1534. This is the final support, below which the trend will turn negative. Therefore, traders can protect their remaining long positions with stops at $3.10.\nOn the other hand, if the pair bounces off the current levels or the 50-day SMA it will again try to break out of $3.8723. If this level is scaled, the next target to watch on the upside is $4.4930.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has risen to the overhead resistance of $163.89 where it is facing some resistance. However, both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which shows that the bulls are in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nA breakout of $163.89 is likely to attract buyers, pushing the price to the next overhead resistance of $175 and above it to $220. The BCH/USD pair has a history of vertical rallies, hence, traders can hold the long positions with the stops at $140.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency turns down from the current level and plunges below the 20-day EMA. In such a case, the pair might become range bound for a few more days.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) soared above the overhead resistance of $16.6442826 and reached very close to our target objective of $18 on March 24. We anticipate a strong resistance at $18. Therefore, we suggest traders book profits above $17, keeping only about 25 percent of the original long position open to ride any move higher. This can be held with a stop loss of $15.\n\nIf the bulls scale above $18, a rally to the lifetime highs of $26.4732350 is probable. This will make the BNB/USD pair one of the first cryptocurrencies to make a new high, which is a positive sign.\nHowever, if the bears defend the $18 level, the price might correct to the 20-day EMA. If this support breaks, a fall to the 50-day SMA is probable. The trend will turn in favor of the bears if the pair sustains below the 50-day SMA.\nXLM/USD\nAfter trying to hold the 20-day EMA for the past four days, Stellar (XLM) has broken down of it. This is a bearish sign because this shows a lack of buying at the strong support of the 20-day EMA.\n\nIf the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the XLM/USD pair can plunge to the 50-day SMA. The uptrend line is just below this support. If the pair breaks below these supports, it can retest the lows.\nConversely, if the digital currency bounces off the current levels, it can reach the resistance line. On a break above $0.13250273, the cryptocurrency can reach $0.14861760. Traders can retain the stop loss on the long positions at $0.08.\nADA/USD\nCardano (ADA) rallied sharply on March 22 and 23, and reached close to our first target objective of $0.066121. With the rise, both the moving averages have turned up and the RSI is also close to the overbought zone.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nThe crypto markets are eagerly awaiting the launch of institutional trading platform Bakkt. Its launch is expected to attract large investors whose involvement is needed to propel markets to the next level. Without even starting operations, investors are already valuing it at $740 million. This is likely to increase further if it can generate large volumes. However, some investors doubt whether it can live up to its expectations and earn enough to justify its valuations.\nThe volumes of the crypto exchanges have been under the scanner as The Tie published a report recently, which suggested that most reported volumes are fake. This puts the total volume of LBank and Bit-Z \u2014 which have overtaken the leading exchange Binance \u2014 in question.\nAs the market matures, fake reporting is likely to be severely dealt with, as seen in the case of South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Komid, where two of its leaders were handed a jail sentence.\nIf the crypto markets bottom out, volumes will pick up. Let\u2019s consult the charts and see if we find a new uptrend in any of the major cryptocurrencies.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) has been crawling higher for the past few days, but it is yet to make a dash towards the overhead resistance of $4,255. On the downside, it is taking support at the 20-day EMA and below it at the uptrend line. Both the moving averages are trending higher and the RSI in positive territory, which indicates that the bulls have the upper hand.\n\nIf the BTC/USD pair does not scale $4,255 within the next few days, traders are likely to book profits that will drag prices lower. Aggressive bears might also initiate short positions if the pair fails to rise above the overhead resistance.\nA breakdown of the 20-day EMA will be the first signal that the bulls are losing their grip. The bears will be back in the driver\u2019s seat if the price sustains below the 50-day SMA. Critical levels to watch on the downside are $3,355 and below it $3,236.09. If the bears sink the digital currency below $3,236.09, it will hurt sentiment and result in panic selling, dragging prices lower.\nThe cryptocurrency will pick up momentum above $4,255 because it will complete a double bottom pattern that has a target objective of $5,273.91. Traders can trail the stops on the long positions higher to $3,550, in order to reduce the risk.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) has formed a small ascending triangle inside a larger ascending triangle pattern. The smaller ascending triangle will complete on a breakout and close above $144.78. The pattern target of this breakout is $163.68, but we anticipate the price to move up to $167.32. On a close above $167.32, the larger ascending triangle will complete that has a pattern target of $251.64.\n\nHowever, a breakdown of the 50-day SMA will invalidate the small ascending triangle and can result in a fall to the trendline of the larger ascending triangle. On a break below this, the bullish pattern will be negated and the ETH/USD pair can fall to $102.49.\nThe 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI is close to the midpoint, which suggests consolidation in the near term. Traders can keep a stop loss of $125 on the remaining long positions.\nXRP/USD\nThere is hardly any volatility in Ripple (XRP). It continues to trade close to the moving averages. The attempt to breakdown of the uptrend line of the ascending triangle found buyers at lower levels on March 21. The price is again back above the trend line.\n\nIf the support breaks, the XRP/USD pair can dip to $0.27795. We expect a strong support at this level, but if this also breaks, the next support to watch out on the downside is $0.24508. The flat moving averages and the RSI close to 50 suggests consolidation for a few more days.\nOn the other hand, if the pair bounces off the current levels, it can move up to $0.33108, above which a rally to the resistance line of the channel is probable. A move above the channel will signal a trend change and can carry the price to $0.40. Traders can keep the stops on the long positions below $0.27795.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) is currently stuck between $56.910 and the resistance line. The bulls have held the support but have failed to push the price above the overhead resistance. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is still in the positive zone. This suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside. However, the failure of the RSI to break out of the negative divergence is concerning.\n\nOn a breakdown of the 20-day EMA, the LTC/USD pair can correct to the 50-day SMA. Therefore, traders can trail the stops on 50 percent of the remaining long positions to $55 and keep the rest at $52. If the pair bounces off the current levels and scales above $62.45, it can rise to $69.2790.\nEOS/USD\nEOS has again failed to break out of the overhead resistance at $3.8723. This is a negative sign. The bears are now likely to attempt to sink the digital currency to the 50-day SMA.\n\nIf the EOS/USD pair plummets below the support of the 50-day SMA and $3.1534, it will weaken and can drop to $2.1733. Therefore, traders can keep the stops on the remaining long positions at $3.10.\nIf the pair bounces off the current levels or the 50-day SMA and breaks out of $3.8723, it can move up to $4.4930. However, the 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has also dipped to the midpoint. This suggests a range formation in the near term.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has turned down from the overhead resistance of $163.89. The positive thing is that it did not break down of the 20-day EMA. \u00a0\n\nBoth the moving averages are gradually sloping up and the RSI is in positive territory. This suggests that the bulls are in command. If the BCH/USD pair rebounds sharply from the current levels or from the 20-day EMA and breaks out of $163.89, it can rally to $175 and above it to $220.\nHowever, if the pair plunges below the 20-day EMA, it can slide to the 50-day SMA. Therefore, traders can trail the stop loss on the long positions at $140.\nBNB/USD\nProfit booking in Binance Coin (BNB) pushed its price below the uptrend line, but the bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-day EMA and push the price back above the uptrend line.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is flattening out while the 50-day SMA remains strong. This indicates that the bulls are losing steam in the short term. A fall below the 20-day EMA will weaken the BNB/USD pair that can drag it to the 50-day SMA.\nOn the other hand, if the pair bounces from the current levels and rallies above $16.6442826, it can resume its uptrend and rally to $18. For now, traders can hold the remaining long positions with stops at $14.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) has corrected to the 20-day EMA where it is finding some support. Both the moving averages are flattening out, which points to a consolidation in the near term.\n\nIf the XLM/USD pair breaks down of the 20-day EMA, it can drop to the 50-day SMA. The uptrend line is just below this level. We anticipate the bulls to defend the zone between the 50-day SMA and the uptrend line.\nConversely, if the pair bounces off the 20-day EMA, it can move up to the resistance line. A breakout of this level can push the price to $0.14861760. The traders can keep the stops on the long positions at $0.08.\nTRX/USD", "birthday": "2019-03-22T18:59:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-22 18:59:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 22}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the\u00a0HitBTC\u00a0exchange.\nAs the cryptocurrencies are rising from the bottom, we have started to hear some bullish voices again. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of BitMEX, expects the price of Bitcoin to reach\u00a0$10,000 this year.\nOne of the events that can cause the price to move northward is the launch of Bakkt. The digital platform\u2019s launch has reportedly been getting\u00a0delayed due to compliance issues, as it planned to have custody of its customers\u2019 Bitcoin. Nonetheless, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has said that it is\u00a0working on all the various crypto-related applications, including Bakkt. So, it could be only a matter of time before they get the green signal.\nAfter the long bear phase, the current recovery is being led by various altcoins. Though the leader, Bitcoin, has only been crawling higher, the altcoins are seeing some sharp gains from the lows. The rise has reduced the dominance of Bitcoin in the past few weeks. In order to cover the altcoin rally better, we have chosen the top five performers among the coins that have a market capitalization of greater than $500 million. \u00a0\u00a0\nONT/USD\nOntology is the top gainer of the past week, as the markets cheered the various announcements made in the past few days. Ontology entered into a\u00a0partnership with MovieBloc, a new participant-centric film distribution platform, that is backed by Korean video streaming platform\nPandora.tv. Li Jun, founder of Ontology,\u00a0said that the project had completed a loyalty-based points solution for Fosun, a Chinese international conglomerate and investment company that has about 100 million users. Ontology is also working on chemical supply chain tracking for the Lanxess group. Will the rally continue or will the traders book profits? Let us find out.\n\nThe\u00a0ONT/USD pair is in a smart pullback after hitting a low of $0.43598112 in December of last year. It is currently in the midst of forming a rounding bottom, which will complete on a breakout above $2.26296972. The minimum target objective of this reversal pattern is $4.08995832. The 20-week EMA has flattened out and the RSI is turning up. This shows that the bears are losing their grip.\nWe expect the bears to mount a strong defense at the current levels. But if the bulls scale and sustain above $1.22947704, the recovery can extend to $2.26296972. Short-term traders can buy on a weekly close (UTC time frame) above $1.22947704 and keep a stop of $0.78. This is a risky trade; hence, please keep the position size to only about 40 percent of normal.\nADA/USD\nCardano (ADA) completed a successful\u00a0upgrade to version 1.5, which is the last major release of the Byron development phase. This update is an important step for moving to the Shelley development phase. After the rally, where does the price go from here? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe\u00a0ADA/USD pair has risen sharply in the past seven days: it has broken out of the range and has risen above the 20-week EMA, which is a positive sign. It should now rally to $0.082952 and if this level is crossed, the next target is $0.094256.\nBoth the moving averages have flattened out and the RSI has also risen to the midpoint. This shows that the trend is changing.\nTraders can buy 50 percent of the desired allocation on a weekly close (UTC time frame) above $0.051468, and buy the rest on a minor dip to the breakout levels. We are recommending two different buy levels because strong breakouts do not retrace, so if the pair continues to move up, the traders will have some chips in the game. But on most occasions, breakouts pullback; if that happens, we want to buy at lower levels. The stops can be kept at $0.0350.\nETC/USD\nThe week saw the\u00a0resignation of Anthony Lusardi from his post as the U.S. director of the Ethereum Classic Cooperative. However, he reiterated that he will continue to be involved with the ETC cooperative and will do some side/programming projects for Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Bitcoin. He said that the social media pressures had become difficult for him to handle, leading to his resignation. Nevertheless, the price of the cryptocurrency did not take a hit due to the departure. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe\u00a0ETC/USD pair is attempting to form a base near the lows: it can move up to $5.889. \u00a0The 20-week EMA is also located close to this level; therefore, we anticipate a strong resistance at $5.889.\nIf the bulls push the price above $5.889, it can rally to the next overhead resistance of $9.50. Therefore, traders can buy on a breakout and weekly close (UTC time frame) above $5.889 and keep a stop loss at $3.3.\nIf the digital currency turns down from $5.889, it might prolong its stay in the range for a few more weeks. It will weaken if it breaks below $3.3.\nBCH/USD\nSwiss-based cryptocurrency ATM operator V\u00e4rdex Suisse has added support for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) on its devices. Swiss online retailer Digitec Galaxus will\u00a0also now accept cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin Cash is one of the many digital currencies on the list.\n\nThe bulls have carried the\u00a0BCH/USD pair to the first overhead resistance of $163.89. Above this level, the digital currency can move to the next overhead resistance of $239. The 20-week EMA is located just below this level. Hence, we anticipate a stiff resistance close to $239. The digital currency has a history of vertical rallies, so if it breaks out of $239, the move can reach $400 and higher.", "birthday": "2019-03-23T17:08:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-23 17:08:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 23}

A joint announcement by IBM and Stellar (XMR) said that as many as six global banks might issue their own stablecoins on IBM\u2019s blockchain-powered payments network, dubbed \u201cBlockchain World Wire\u201d (BWW).\nThe question now is whether this marks a turning point for cryptocurrency\u2019s use, or if it merely continues the experiments that have marked the early stages of digital money. While quite a few financial institutions seem ready to go blockchain and create tokens in a bid to streamline cross-border payments, some still choose to set the technology aside.\nCitigroup, the corporation behind one of the world\u2019s top-20 banks by asset value, revealed earlier this week that it was abandoning its \u201cCiticoin\u201d project to focus on more conventional remittance methods like SWIFT. The bank\u2019s reasoning seemed focused on preserving the current forms of inter-bank transfers as a proven and universal method.\nCan those bank-issued coins be called \u201ccryptocurrencies\u201d?\nWhen JPMorgan Chase announced that it built its own digital token based on a private Ethereum (ETH) blockchain last month, the crypto community seemed largely skeptical.\nNathaniel Popper, author of the book \u201cDigital Gold, a History of Bitcoin,\u201d tweeted back then:\n\u201cThe JPM Coin makes it possible to move dollars between JPMorgan bank accounts instantly. That raises the question: Why was it not already possible to move dollars between two JPMorgan bank accounts instantly?\u201d\nGiven that the JPM Coin is only available for private use within the inner circle of the banks\u2019 clients, one should be hesitant to even call it a cryptocurrency, according to at least one expert.\nHartej Sawhney, a blockchain expert and co-founder of Hosho, a startup protecting investments and providing multiple smart contract services, told Cointelegraph in an email:\n\u201cRecently, banks and media have had a field day misusing the word cryptocurrency. There is no such thing as a \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019 without open consensus or permissionless participation. Announcing a new \u2018coin\u2019 was simply a marketing play for J.P. Morgan. Bitcoin for example, is open source, permissionless, strictly limited in quantity, and has no account fees.\u201d\nNot only is the JPM Coin permissioned and available only to institutional customers who have been cleared via JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Know Your Customer (KYC) precautions, Sawhney added, it is also pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies held by the bank. That is fundamentally different from what cryptocurrencies constitute, he argued:\n\u201cAnyone can use a cryptocurrency, and anyone can participate in its consensus system without seeking permission from anyone else.\u201d\nRegulated institutions will act\nMichael Dowling, CEO and founder of FairX, a financial services company involved with banking and digital assets, and former chief technology officer at IBM\u2019s blockchain arm, also distinguishes bank-issued coins from conventional, \u201cpure-play\u201d cryptocurrencies akin to Bitcoin (BTC), XRP and XMR. Bank-backed tokens are \u201ccryptocurrency implementations of fiat currency,\u201d which are commonly referred to as \u201cstablecoins.\u201d He told Cointelegraph:\n\u201cA lot of people are obsessed with this \u2018token\u2019 thing, but at the end of the day a bank is a really fancy ledgering company with amazing security; the key to bank's successful use of blockchain tech, in a practical way, is to shift some of the authentication of a user from the centralized bank to the user's own device, proven by a cryptographic ledger. That's really what this bank-issued coin is really all about \u2014 it\u2019s still the same USD ledger, its authentication for who is allowed to change the ledger has shifted from username/password at the bank to pub-pri key cryptography in a distributed fashion.\u201d\nDowling then summarized his statement: \u201cI do NOT believe regulated institutions will announce their own pure-play cryptocurrencies, but I am absolutely certain they will announce their own deposits on ledger.\u201d\nInterestingly, while JPMorgan Chase\u2019s move was largely reported as a first for a United States bank (and any major lender), New York-based Signature Bank rolled out a similar feature earlier in December 2018. Dubbed the Signet Platform, the private blockchain allows the banks\u2019 clients to move their money \u201cin 30 seconds,\u201d just like the JPM Coin \u2014 and it is also pegged to the U.S. dollar. It comes as no surprise that Signature\u2019s coin was largely overlooked, given how the bank compares to JPMorgan Chase size-wise: The former has just $45 billion in assets, while the latter wields more than $2 trillion.\nWhen announcing the feature, Signature Bank co-founder and CEO Joseph J. DePaolo seemed particularly bullish on the use of private blockchains for financial institutions. He told Forbes:\n\u201cWe have to do this, otherwise we\u2019re not going to exist. [...] If you\u2019re not involved in blockchain, in five years, you won\u2019t be around as a bank.\u201d\nDePaolo\u2019s viewpoint seems to echo the findings of Citigroup\u2019s \u201cBank of the Future\u201d report, which suggests that fintech companies that are actively disrupting the banking market with new technologies are driving out its longstanding participants \u2014 or at least compelling them to give up a large portion of their margins, a traditionally important source of income for banks. Specifically, the paper estimates that by 2025, major North American banks could lose 34 percent of profit from mainstream areas such as payments, investments and personal lending.\nWhat is a bank-issued coin\u2019s purpose?\nPrimarily, banks tend to pick up blockchain for instantaneous cross-border payments. The technology shows a lot of potential within that field. Blockchain reportedly allows performing international remittance \u201cin near real-time,\u201d according to the IBM website, while normally they take three to five working days to complete within the existing infrastructure. Moreover, transaction costs can be saved as third-party intermediaries get removed from the process (according to research from McKinsey, the average cost for a bank to execute a cross-border payment through correspondent banking costs $25 to $35).\nThe two largest blockchain projects aiming to streamline cross-border remittance for global banks are hosted by Ripple and IBM Blockchain. Ripple has at least two blockchain-powered payment tools for those purposes, called xRapid and xCurrent (the main difference between them is that xRapid uses XRP, the company\u2019s native token, while the latter works with fiat currencies). IBM, in turn, oversees its Blockchain World Wire (BWW) payment network operating on the Stellar (XMR) blockchain, which completed its beta in September 2018.\nAt this point, both Ripple and IBM Blockchain seem to be a force to be reckoned with: RippleNet reportedly has more than 200 clients, while BWW, which has been around for considerably less time, is currently used by 54 banks, as Jesse Lund, global vice president of IBM Blockchain, told Cointelegraph. Both of them are networks that are open to a wider amount of financial institutions, while some banks \u2014 like the aforementioned JPMorgan Chase \u2014 want to deploy their own private ledgers.\nNotably, unlike Ripple, IBM\u2019s BWW supports different digital assets within its blockchain, including bank-issued coins: Just recently, Cheddar reported that six international banks \u2014 such as Brazil\u2019s Banco Bradesco, South Korea\u2019s Bank Busan and the Philippines\u2019 Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation \u2014 have signed letters of intent to issue their own stablecoins backed by their national fiat currencies on IBM\u2019s network. \u201cThese are expected to add Euro, Indonesian Rupiah, Philippine Peso, Korean Won and Brazilian Real stable coins to the network,'' Lund told Cointelegraph in an email, adding:\n\u201cUltimately, we hope to see a global financial network that represents a real-time facility for moving money from anywhere to anywhere \u2014 where foreign exchange is just an inherent part of the process that happens automatically through the use of an expanding digital asset ecosystem.\u201cWorld Wire can use fiat currency, lumens or stable coins. This is a completely new kind of payments infrastructure than traditionally used, and it differs from SWIFT and other approaches.\u201d\nDowling also highlighted this feature as a major advantage for the network:\n\u201cWhile IBM's service does use a pure-play crypto as a settlement asset as an option, I believe the legitimate institutions will use fiat-stablecoins issued by banks as settlement assets instead. That stabs Ripple in the heart \u2014 why use XRP if I can use....an acknowledged and accepted currency?\u201d\nCointelegraph has reached out to Ripple to get a further comment for this article, but they failed to prepare a statement before press time.\nRipple\u2019s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has criticized the concept of bank-issued digital coins (which he calls \u201cbank coins\u201d) and specifically the JPM Coin in the past, citing its centralized structure, among other things. He has also argued that the JPM Coin lacks the interoperability that would make it a significant innovation:\n\u201cThis guy from Morgan Stanley was interviewing me last week, and I asked him, so is Morgan Stanley going to use the JPM Coin? Probably not. Will Citi use it? [...] Will PNC? And the answer is no. So we\u2019re going to have all these different coins, and we\u2019re back to where we are: there\u2019s a lack of interoperability.\u201d\nDowling agrees with that statement. \u201cIt [the JPM Coin] MUST be interoperable between banking institutions for it to work properly,\u201d he told Cointelegraph. \u201cOtherwise, we're just swapping bank currencies.\u201d\nBank-issued stablecoins vs. public stablecoins\nStablecoins \u2014 with their ability to overcome crypto\u2019s infamous volatility \u2014 have become widespread during the bear market, especially among more compliance-oriented players.\nProjects like USD Coin (USDC), launched by payments company Circle in conjunction with Coinbase, the Winklevoss twins-backed Gemini dollar, Paxos and Facebook\u2019s secretive project are among the most notable examples.\nRecently, Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, has argued that, as the sector continues to see new market participants, stablecoins using an open-standards approach will prevail, while also welcoming Facebook\u2019s still-to-be-confirmed plans:\n\"That's [Facebook\u2019s reported plans are] very, very positive in our view overall. The approach that we\u2019ve taken is to create a consortium model. When we think about a standard for how fiat money works on the internet, it\u2019s really critical that it\u2019s an open standard that many companies can implement, that has an self-governance mechanism around it that can evolve both a technical standard as well as a membership framework.\u201d\nEssentially, Allair argued that creating \u201can HTTP for money on the internet\u201d that could support global participation from multiple actors is \u201cultimately going to be much more successful than a single company issuing a cryptocurrency themselves.\u201d \u00a0\nHowever, Dowling told Cointelegraph that stablecoins that are not issued by banking institutions might have a significant disadvantage over the public ones run by startups:\n\u201cOnly banks can \u2018take deposits,\u2019 which have a specific meaning with specific legal protections around the assets held on deposit in case of bankruptcy. \u00a0Some, such as Gemini, have set up \u2018trusts\u2019 to park the cash, but it requires costly monthly attestations that come, frankly, for free as a bank. In addition, the Gemenis, the Circles, etc. all seem to be releasing their coins for the purpose of de-risking within their platforms. Very short term thinking, and no one is going to do real business (with real volumes with real value) using that setup. That's what banks are for.\u201d\nNotably, Ron Karpovich, global head of e-commerce solutions at JPMorgan Chase, has recently raised a similar point in an interview with CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box.\nIn response to a question as to how the top U.S. bank is ready to compete with new actors that can employ blockchain and cryptocurrencies to offer the same services as the industry\u2019s veterans, but with cheaper fees, Karpovich said:\n\u201cUltimately behind the scenes, they [crypto innovators] are going to have to use a bank to move funds. There\u2019s more partnership instead of competition in that space. [...] When it comes to margins and capabilities \u2014 payments is never something that grows in margin, nobody wants to pay for a payment. That\u2019s one of the hardest parts of this process: you have limited resources in the capability to sell, so you need highly efficient and large players.\u201d\n\u201cCiticoin\u201d: The four-year project cut short in favor of more traditional remittance methods\nCitigroup, unlike other mainstream institutions that couldn\u2019t resist mentioning the word \u201cblockchain\u201d in their press releases at the time when it was popular to do so, has kept its cryptocurrency operation underground. It first surfaced back in July 2015, when International Business Times interviewed Ken Moore, head of Citi Innovation Labs. Moore told the publication that they were studying distributed ledger technology (DLT) for \"the last few years.\" Moreover, he added, the lab had constructed three separate blockchains and a cryptocurrency for test purposes:\n\u201cThey [the three blockchains] are all within the labs just now so there is no real money passing through these systems yet, they are at a pre-production level to be clear. [...] We also have an equivalent to bitcoin up and running, again within the labs, so we can mine what we call a 'Citicoin', for want of a better term. It's in the labs, but it's to make sure we are at the leading edge of this technology and that we can exploit the opportunities within it.\"\nMoore also specified that \"most of our efforts have been focused on payments; trade probably being a second runner.\"", "birthday": "2019-03-20T18:12:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-20 18:12:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 20}

Not Quite, but It\u2019s Optimistic ", "content": "Ethereum is most likely not a security under existing United States laws, as previously said by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Division of Corporate Finance head William Hinman.\n\"Based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions,\u201d Hinman said on June 14, 2018.\nBut, while the statement of SEC Chairman Jay Clayton released on March 12 is certainly positive for the cryptocurrency sector, it did not directly confirm that Ethereum is not a security.\nIndirect comment on Ethereum\nIn a letter, Clayton said that he agrees with Hinman\u2019s explanation when a cryptocurrency transaction does not represent an investment contract or the transfer of a security.\n\u201cI agree with Director Hinman\u2019s explanation of how a digital asset transaction may no longer represent an investment contract. If, for example, purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out the essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts. Under those circumstances, the digital asset may not represent an investment contract under the Howey framework.\u201d\nHowever, according to Marco Santori, the president of Blockchain.com, one of the largest cryptocurrency wallet operators in the global market, the statement by Clayton does not directly confirm the regulatory nature of Ethereum to Congress.\nClayton said that he agrees with Hinman\u2019s explanation on the point in which a token can no longer be accurately characterized as a security but did not directly and conclusively state that Ethereum is not a security under existing laws, Santori explained:\n\u201cClayton didn't say that \u2018Ether is no longer a security.\u2019 He said he agreed with Hinman's explanation of when a token is no longer a security. Hinman can say stuff like that but for the Chairman to say it in a letter to Congress is another matter entirely. It would be construed as binding, and the SEC isn't trying to have that.\u201d\nAlthough Santori said that he does not think Ethereum is a security \u2014 and so did other industry executives and regulators, including Hinman \u2014 there is a gap between an SEC official offering his thoughts on the regulatory nature of the SEC and the chairman of the commission stating it to Congress.\n\u201cOkay but is Ether a security? No, I don't think it is,\u201d Santori said.\nDoes it change the ICO market?\nIn recent years, the initial coin market (ICO) market has adopted the Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) contract to target accredited investors over anonymous or unaccredited investors.\nAs such, most SAFT contracts, which are considered an issuance of security, do not allow investors based in the U.S. to participate in token sales, due to the ambiguity surrounding ICO regulation.\nMore importantly, unless it obtains the approval of the SEC, an ICO project prefers to not risk being classified as a security within the U.S. and run into conflict with U.S. regulators rather than target U.S.-based investors.\nSantori emphasized that the SEC Chairman did not endorse the SAFT framework in any manner nor reject Ethereum as a security:\n\u201cDid Clayton endorse the SAFT framework? Lolno [sic]. Nor did he say that Ether is not a security. Words have meaning, though, and so does diction. It's tough to ignore these letters and everything that goes into them. Best predictive value we have, for now.\u201d\nClayton\u2019s recent statement, which could be viewed as a positive step toward cryptocurrency and ICO regulation, does not provide enough clarity on the regulatory nature of most tokens and does not definitively show that Ethereum is not a security.\nWhy governments will likely back away from characterizing Ethereum as a security\nAs SEC official Hinman said last year, the definition of a token as a security will continue to be a case-by-case scenario that could differ based on time frames. The official noted that systems that directly rely on central actors or a centralized institution for success are considered securities.\nEven if an ICO or a token sale starts off as a non-security, if the token begins to rely on a central institution, Hinman suggested that securities laws could be applied.\n\u201cOver time, there may be other sufficiently decentralized networks and systems where regulating the tokens or coins that function on them as securities may not be required. And of course there will continue to be systems that rely on central actors whose efforts are a key to the success of the enterprise. In those cases, application of the securities laws protects the investors who purchase the tokens or coins.\u201d\nCryptocurrencies and public blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum are unlikely to be considered securities because there always have been open-source developer communities working to improve and develop the codebases of the two crypto assets.\nBut, once a token or a blockchain project begins to rely on a central group of developers or authorities, it could run into the risk of being described as a security in the U.S.\nCharacterizing Ethereum as a security could be detrimental to the growth of the global blockchain sector. Most blockchain projects and tokens are based on Ethereum in the form of ERC-20 tokens and utilize the smart contract standard to execute transactions and process information.\nAs such, industry executives do not expect the regulators in the U.S. or other key governments to consider Ethereum as a security.\nHow is the overall regulatory landscape in the U.S.?\nWith companies the likes of Gemini putting in the efforts of maintaining strictly regulated cryptocurrency trading platforms that are compliant with both federal and state-specific regulations, the infrastructure of the U.S. cryptocurrency market is strengthening at a rapid pace.\nHowever, it is not likely to see an ICO-supportive and token-sale-adopting market in the U.S. anytime soon. Similar to Japan, where ICOs to the public are banned but are set to be opened to institutional investors and potentially accredited investors, the SEC is expected to continue encouraging blockchain projects to cooperate with the agency by receiving an approval.\nIn December 2018, as Cointelegraph reported, Chairman Clayton said that ICOs could be an effective way for entrepreneurs and teams to raise capital, but it has to be done in the right way \u2014 i.e., following the securities laws of the U.S.", "birthday": "2019-03-20T20:59:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-20 20:59:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 20}

However, it is difficult to change the attitude of the people accustomed to using outdated systems and platforms. To give the nascent space a favorable push among the lawmakers, the number of lobbyists working on blockchain technology issues in Washington D.C. tripled in 2018.\nThough fundamentals have been improving, the price of cryptocurrencies has been slow to respond. Nevertheless, a few major digital currencies have risen sharply from the yearly lows. Are they good for more, or will the rally stall? Let\u2019s find out.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight range between $3,950 and $4,035 for the past three days. Usually, a tight consolidation is followed by a range expansion. We expect the bulls to propel the price towards the overhead resistance of $4,255. This level will also act as a stiff resistance. But if the digital currency breaks out and sustains above $4,255, it will complete a double bottom pattern that has a target objective of $5,273.91.\nBoth the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in positive territory. This shows that the bulls have the upper hand.\n\nContrary to our expectation, if the BTC/USD pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the uptrend line, it can dip to the 50-day SMA. If this support also breaks, a fall to $,3575 is probable.\nThe trend will turn negative on a breakdown to new yearly lows. Such a move will dent the sentiment and can prolong the existing bear market. Therefore, traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions below $3,236.09.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) is holding the 20-day EMA for the past two days. But it has failed to breakout and rally above $144.78. We anticipate a strong decisive move within the next few days.\n\nIf the bulls scale $144.78, a quick rally to $167.32 is likely because there is no resistance in between these two levels. On a close (UTC time frame) above $167.32, the ascending triangle pattern that has a target objective of $251.64 will complete.\nConversely, if the bears sink the ETH/USD pair below the 50-day SMA, a fall to $116.3 is probable. Traders can protect the remaining long positions with stops at $125.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) continues to consolidate in a tight range. This shows a balance between buyers and sellers. The flat moving averages and the RSI close to 50 suggests that the range bound action might continue for a few more days.\n\nThe next trending move will start either on a breakout of the overhead resistance of $0.33108 or a breakdown from the uptrend line of the ascending triangle.\nOn the upside, the target levels to watch out for are the resistance line of the descending channel and above it $0.40. Above this level, the XRP/USD pair is likely to pick up momentum. On the downside, $0.27795 is an important support, below which the slide can deepen to $0.24508. Therefore, traders can retain the stops on the long positions below $0.27795.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) is trying to bounce off the support at $56.910. If the bulls can push it above $62.45, it will indicate strength. The next level to watch on the upside is $65.561 and above it $69.2790.\n\nBoth the moving averages are sloping up, which shows that the bulls have the upper hand. Still, we continue to watch the negative divergence on the RSI closely.\nIf the LTC/USD pair reverses direction and plummets below the 20-day EMA, it can drop to the 50-day SMA. Therefore, we suggest traders keep the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $52.\nEOS/USD\nThe bulls again bought the dip below the 20-day EMA, which indicates demand at lower levels. However, EOS is facing resistance close to $3.8723. The price is largely stuck between these two levels. We expect the digital currency to break out of the overhead resistance or break down of the 20-day EMA within the next few days.\n\nOn a breakdown below the 20-day EMA, the EOS/USD pair can slide to the 50-day SMA and below it to $3.1534. We anticipate a strong support around these levels, hence, we propose a stop loss of $3.10 on the remaining long positions.\nConversely, if the bulls push the price above $3.8723, a rally to $4.4930 is probable. The up-sloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has been trading close to the overhead resistance of $163.89 for the past three days. This shows that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits. The moving averages have started to slope up gradually and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. This shows that the bulls are in command.\n\nA breakout and close above the BCH/USD pair will carry the price to $175 and above it to $220. Eventually, we expect the pair to reach the stiff overhead resistance of $239. Therefore, traders can keep the stop loss on their long positions at $116.\nContrary to our assumption, if the digital currency turns down from the current levels, it can correct to the 20-day EMA and below it to the 50-day SMA.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) rallied to the resistance line on March 18 but could not break out of it. Profit booking has again pushed the digital currency back into the range. However, the 20-day EMA is sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. This suggests that the bulls are at an advantage.\n\nIf the XLM/USD pair breaks out of the resistance line, it can rally to $0.13250273 and above it to $0.14861760. We expect the 20-day EMA to act as a support on any dip.\nOur bullish assumption will be negated if the pair plunges below the 20-day EMA and slides to the 50-day SMA. For now, traders can retain the stops on the long positions at $0.08. We shall soon trail it higher to $0.10.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) has dipped below $15.9100517 and is retesting the support at $15. The small uptrend line also lies at this level and the 20-day EMA is just below it. We expect this support zone between $15 and the 20-day EMA to hold.\n\nBoth the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. This suggests that the bulls are in command.\nIf the BNB/USD pair rebounds from the support zone, it will again attempt to break out of the overhead resistance and move towards its target objective of $18. On the other hand, a breakdown of the 20-day EMA can sink the price to the 50-day SMA. Traders can, therefore, keep the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $14.\nTRX/USD\nTron (TRX) has been trading close to the 20-day EMA for the past six days. The small trading ranges suggest a balance between buyers and sellers. However, this is unlikely to continue for long. We should see an increase in volatility within the next few days.\n", "birthday": "2019-03-20T21:50:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-20 21:50:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 20}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-and-ai-leading-the-way-to-the-fourth-industrial-revolution-against-the-odds", "title": " Blockchain and AI: Leading the Way to the Fourth Industrial Revolution Against the Odds ", "content": "Human imagination and the strive to turn science fiction into science fact goes back to ancient times, but has only truly begun to manifest itself in the last 50 years. Though mostly unseen by average users, artificial intelligence (AI) is already deeply embedded in the basic processes people have become accustomed to.\nBlockchain technology has come to the forefront in much the same way AI had, through a long development process full of trials, tribulations, ignorance and triumphs over skeptics and critics alike.\nThe application potential for blockchain is no less extensive than it is for AI \u2014 and today, these technologies are more complementary than competitive in their natures. Both AI and blockchain work on the principle of analyzing vast amounts of data and solving the issues of specific industries. Just as AI found its applications in the fintech sector as a data aggregator and automated solution determiner, so began blockchain in its permeation into areas of application where its properties can be of most use.\nInto the unknown\nSociety is now entering what is known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution. But unlike the first three, which were based on the application of machinery for streamlining of the means of mass production through digital information accessibility, the new wave of technological progress promises to be a revolution of automation, rather than an involvement of masses of people needed for maintaining industrial processes.\nAI and blockchain may become the leaders of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, as they can allow artificial constructs and programs to perform a vast number of tasks that had previously required human labor and entailed high risks of error. According to a study carried out by researchers from PwC in 2018, 30 percent of jobs may become automated by the 2030s, with 44 percent of workers with a low level of education being at particular risk. At the same time, as the report showed that automation could help the United States\u2019 gross domestic product (GDP) reach $15 trillion by 2030.\n\nThe background underpinning the modern world is big data, the factor uniting blockchain and AI in their applications.\nThe modern world produces a staggering amount of information that needs to be processed. Since the information being produced is of an endless variety of topics, there is physically no human workforce capable of analyzing such vast amounts of data. The AI can analyze large amounts of data and blockchain can serve as the immutable foundation for securely storing the records for use by various industries, since the Fourth Industrial Revolution is more of a breakthrough in data analysis.\nComplementing each other\nBy being able to continuously analyze data under a strict protocol required for achieving desired results, AI leads the way by allowing data to be properly stratified and shared. This essential attribute automates a mundane process and brings to the forefront one of the main qualities of AI in the form of efficiency.\nBlockchain, on the other hand, is the vital component that lends its characteristics to make sure the data is handled in an environment that is safe from external interference, as well as tampering of data ownership and sequence. This is what may complement AI and solve the problem of trust many people face. Take, for example, the recent scandal engulfing Facebook, when personal data from over 50 million social network users were harvested by Cambridge Analytica via an algorithm that targeted voters during the U.S. election.\n\nPaul Lee, co-founder and CEO of Mind AI, an AI-powered platform, believes that blockchain plays an essential role in the process of making data management decentralized:\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see AI and blockchain as two separate, incompatible technologies, but rather as two technologies that can complement each other very nicely. The world of AI is an arms race, with large internet giants leading the progress with their seemingly unlimited resources, specifically data. These corporations collect data from their users in a centralized database. The data is owned and utilized by these companies for their own self-interests, while the users who provided the data are left empty handed. This also creates an uneven playing field in the advancement of AI technology, since data is the primary fuel that powers most modern AI systems. This can be detrimental to humanity, as AI technology is extremely powerful.\u201d\nAnd although the use of AI to collect personal information has become the most common way to use this technology, blockchain can help change the reputation of AI by storing the AI \u200b\u200bmechanisms that process data on a distributed registry. At the same time, using private and public keys, users themselves determine who should be given access to their personal data. And for those who want to further protect personal information from third parties, AI-powered blockchains may provide decentralized identification.\nUS, UAE and Malta lead revolution\nOne way or another, everything depends on the approval of regulators and authorities in matters of adoption of any kind of technology. No matter how innovative a technology is, it first needs to prove its worth to average people to become profitable. And that is why governments are considering the capabilities offered by AI \u2014 an already proven and effective technology \u2014 and its merger with blockchain, which still requires considerable research.\nThe U.S. government is already leading the charge after issuing an American AI Initiative order that will facilitate investments into AI and related technologies research. On Feb. 11, the Trump administration announced that the president signed an executive order that calls upon federal government agencies to allocate the necessary resources and workers to adapt to the era of AI. The initiative has documented Trump\u2019s long-term plans to enter the AI-powered future. Back in May 2018, the White House held a meeting devoted to AI, with over 30 large companies from a number of industries \u2014 including Ford, Boeing, Amazon and Microsoft \u2014 in which the officials promised not to prevent the technology\u2019s development by creating AI regulations.\nThe United Arab Emirates is trailing close behind as the National Program for AI and Blockchain Capacity Building was launched on Nov. 28, 2018 to provide university courses and scholarships in AI and blockchain technology under the purview of the Ministry of Education. The innovation has complemented the UAE\u2019s Strategy for Artificial Intelligence, which is aimed at turning the country into a leading power in the adoption of AI by 2031.\nMalta is seeking to take on a leading role in this brave new world of technological races as it strives to become a \u201cBlockchain Island\u201d and a \u201ctop AI nation.\u201d As reported by Cointelegraph on Nov. 1, the Maltese government announced the launch of the initiative called \u201cMalta.ai,\u201d creating friendly conditions for the companies developing AI solutions.\nFinally, India, a powerhouse economy, is launching initiatives aimed at improving its energy sector using AI and blockchain. The government created a special committee to carry out a national AI program that aims at helping startups and venture funds to conduct research related to the technology. The country also announced a partnership with Russia to cooperate in using blockchain and AI technologies at the Strategic Economic Summit, which was held in Russia in November 2018. The two countries agreed to boost two-way investments in the high-tech sector to $30 billion by 2025.\nUse cases\nDespite the fact that blockchain and AI seem to be incompatible at first glance \u2014 the first is based on the principle of decentralized data storage, and the second allows information to be concentrated in the hands of centralized corporations \u2014 today, companies have learned to combine them in their processes.\nNew networks combining AI and blockchain aim to make machine learning transparent and less biased, says Jeremy Epstein, the head of Never Stop Marketing.\nToday, industry leaders are solving the nontrivial task of combining two technologies in order to preserve the privacy of user data and achieve greater automation in complex analytical processes.\nDeepSee, a media platform, strives to provide the solution to the problem of fake news and become a decentralized alternative to Reddit, YouTube, Medium and Twitter. At the same time, DeepSee reportedly uses the same machine learning mechanisms used by Facebook, but transfers them to a trusted blockchain platform that guarantees transparency of privacy settings, as well as rewarding users for high-quality content in a similar way to Steemit.\nIn the health care sector, personal information security is of the highest importance. The AI-powered \u200b\u200bcompany Deep Mind, acquired by Google, is already leveraging blockchain to better protect users\u2019 health data. In February, Neuromation also entered the health care sector, entering into a partnership with the Longenesis, a decentralized marketplace of personal data.\nLongenesis, in turn, intends to provide individuals with control over their own personal data and the option to monetize it by passing certain data to corporations, research institutes and medical institutions at their discretion. Such data includes not only a medical history or a genetic profile, but also, for example, test results. \u201cOur goal is to create a new, data-driven economy,\u201d says Alexander Zhavoronkov, chief science officer of Longenesis Limited.\nAnother use of the blockchain in AI-based services is being investigated by Mind AI and SingularityNet. The companies use a decentralized registry to reward users. Mind AI, a company that has invented an AI-powered solution aiming to achieve human-level reasoning, leverages blockchain to make the entire machine thought process transparent for average people. As an open-source platform, Mind AI rewards its contributors with tokens for adding value to the platform\u2019s ontology database. Thanks to the AI-powered reasoning engine and the ontologies input by the community, Mind AI can reason like a real human, requiring no massive quantities of data. Lee, the platform\u2019s co-founder and CEO, believes that blockchain in AI solutions enhances the way users\u2019 data is protected and used for the community benefits:\n\u201cWe believe blockchain provides the foundation to creating [sic] AI systems that are transparent, decentralized, and beneficial for many, rather than a few.", "birthday": "2019-03-19T13:06:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-19 13:06:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 19}

As a professional investor, she is very interested in financing early stage crypto and blockchain projects. She believes that stablecoins are perfectly designed for the needs of internet payments and will steadily gain popularity as the industry evolves.\nWe talked to Sterling Witzke about the future of fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies, the necessity of proper legal frameworks and the future of the maturing crypto industry.\nClarity is always good for an ecosystem\nAna Berman: How do you think, what will 2019 bring in terms of regulation? The question is related to the ads that Gemini recently launched, which said, in particular, \u201cCrypto needs rules.\u201d Don\u2019t you think it undermines the whole idea of decentralization?\nSterling Witzke: The short answer is no. As you know from the slogans, Gemini is very pro-thoughtful regulation and believes that consumers in the crypto space deserve the same protection as consumers in other industries.\nIt's all about making fair outcomes for all. It doesn't undermine the original ethos of crypto to have regulations. The distinction comes with the companies that are built on top of the protocol. So, at the protocol level, it's absolutely correct that you don't need any more regulation and rules, because those are already built in.\nYou've got the math and the cryptography that dictates the rules on the protocol. The difference is that the applications and companies built on top of those protocols are run by humans, and we all know they are fallible. That's where the oversight comes into play.\n\nAB: The United States Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) has recently claimed that crypto will be its top examination priority in 2019. Do you believe the SEC will take some important steps this year?\nSW: I hope so. I think that regulatory clarity, especially on things like security tokens versus utility tokens, is needed to get us towards mass adoption. I know there are several companies that were thinking about raising capital, but are now a bit hesitant because they just aren't quite sure how to operate in a gray area. Such firms want to ask for permission rather than forgiveness, which is our model also, and thus we appreciate that. But I think that clarity is always good for an ecosystem.\nAB: Many entrepreneurs participate in crypto initiatives, like draft bills, round tables, etc. Is Winklevoss Capital interested in proposing some regulation or maybe discussing it with legislators?\nSW: Tyler and Cameron are very involved and proactively working with regulators to help form the way that these rules are made, which I think is very important. We don't want government to come down with a heavy hand, as they might not understand the intricacies of the ecosystem.\nI am not involved in the regulatory side, but Tyler and Cameron have been very active in the space for a long time. One of the most recent initiatives is the Virtual Commodities Association [VCA], which is a self-regulatory organization started by Gemini. I believe that its current executive director, Maria Filipakis, is actually from the the New York Department of Financial Services [DFS]. So, there is a lot of ongoing communication and collaboration with regulators to try to move this case forward.\nInvestors are dipping their toes in crypto, no one is taking the plunge\nAB: As far as we know, Winklevoss Capital is mostly focused on the investments and the institutional side of the business. Do you believe there will be more Wall Street involvement in 2019? What do you expect in terms of institutional investments? \nSW: I don't think that 2019 is necessarily the year. The end of 2017 was so crazy. People tend to think of the space as moving at lightning speed, but the underlying development doesn't move that fast. I think it takes a while for institutions to get comfortable. There needs to be a better custody, and any kind of healthy debt and credit markets to get those institutions really excited.\nSo, I don't think that I would make a prediction that 2019 is necessarily the year. I think that a lot of investors are thoughtfully dipping their toes in, but I don't really see anyone completely taking the plunge.\nCrypto markets face healthy corrections, as any emerging industry\nAB: CNBC\u2019s Brian Kelly once compared crypto regulations to a ski track. Someone has to put a warning sign on a dangerous one, and the skier then decides whether to take risk or not. Do you think it is a relevant description of what\u2019s going on? \nSW: I think that is a nice sentiment. The majority of me believes in free markets and free will. Everyone should be able to invest in what they want to invest in. But the fact is that we have some responsibilities to protect people.\nI grew up in South Dakota, for example, and crypto has not really made a splash in the Midwest, yet. In the end of 2017, I had lots of friends who bought Bitcoin at $18,000 or $19,000 and kind of lost their shirts. For such a new market, we need the same protections as we do with public equities. The precedent is already here, and there is really no difference.\nAB: You just mentioned the bubble of December 2017. Do you think it was a necessary process \u2014 let\u2019s say, a sign of development?\nSW: One hundred percent. I think that lots of new industries need irrational exuberance to garner excitement and really get the word out there. Thousands more people now know of Bitcoin. That said, there's no reason why Bitcoin should have been $19,000.\nThat was all irrational exuberance, bubble \u2014 whatever you want to call it. You could maybe argue that this is an overly healthy correction, but I think that a healthy correction was 100 percent necessary. It's part of the traditional cycle of a new industry emerging.\nIt was necessary to move this base forward, because it got rid of a lot of bad actors. From the end of 2017 to the beginning of 2018, we saw every Joe Blow creating an ICO [initial coin offering] just to raise, in some instances, hundreds of millions of dollars, and then take off and drink a Mai Tai on the beach. But their investors lost everything. The people that are left and active in the space are really in it for the long term. They see the fundamental effect that blockchain will have globally for the next 100 years. These people are in the industry for the long term.\nBitcoin is a store of value, not a speculative asset\nAB: What, in your opinion, is a fair price for Bitcoin? \nSW: I won't make any price predictions, but I am happy where we are, because we're in a build phase in the ecosystem. I think that the speculators that drove the price up are now sitting on the sidelines. And again, the people that are left truly believe in an ecosystem and think of Bitcoin as a store of value rather than a speculative asset.\nAB: So, the ongoing price correction, let\u2019s say, when Bitcoin hovers around $3,500, is more or less a fair process, right? \nSW: I think it's a fair process. And we'll probably be at these price levels for a while. There is a lot of underlying infrastructure work to be done with things like scalability, user experience, etc. Maybe not on the underlying infrastructure part, but on the top layer. People aren't going to use these applications if we can't make it foolproof and extremely easy to use.\nStablecoins are designed for internet payments\nAB: As per recent studies, the era of ICO craziness is now over. Many believe the future is in tokenized assets and stablecoins. Do you share this stance? \nSW: The short answer is yes. The dollar has been a great form of payment for a long time, but it was not designed for the internet age we are currently in. We need a stable currency that works with the blockchain and the internet. Fiat-pegged stablecoins bring us ability to purchase assets or to be paid dividends in assets that are not volatile.\nThe craziest example of using something like Bitcoin as a form of payment is the pizza that was bought for 10,000 BTC back in the day. At that time, it was $20, and now it is about $3 million. So, we need something like a fiat-backed stablecoin to be able to facilitate transactions on the blockchain. It's a currency designed for crypto.\nThat said, I'll give my plug for the Gemini dollar [GUSD]. The Gemini dollar is 100 percent backed by the U.S. dollar, and it's the only stablecoin that has actually released their banking partner, State Street, and are very upfront about that. State Street can say, \u201cYes, with 100 percent certainty we have 100 percent of the dollars that back GUSD.\u201d\nAB: Can you please tell us something about Winklevoss Capital\u2019s blockchain plans for 2019?\nSW: Winklevoss Capital invests in both blockchain and nonblockchain-related startups. So on the traditional venture capital side, we invest in early stage companies, both seed and Series A across industries. We've done a little bit of everything from e-commerce to IT hardware, and international logistics, and everything else.\nOn the blockchain side of things, we think about investing very similarly. We're not trying to be a hedge fund, we're not flipping public tokens. We sat out of the ICO craze, we've already discussed. We're looking for a really long-term companies and founders that are trying to build a company for the next decades. We're investing very patient capital with a seven to 10 years\u2019 time horizon. We're focused very much on infrastructure. As I mentioned, we think that scalability solutions for things like smart contracts are really interesting.\nThere's so many interesting applications, like the ability to prove identity and bank the unbanked, which involves 2 billion people that don't have an official form of ID or can't get a bank account. If you think about 2 billion people coming online, not a single existing protocol can handle that.\nYou can also think of Bitcoin doing seven to 10 transactions a second, Ethereum doing 10 to 15, as a maximum \u2014 that's just not feasible. So, we're looking at solutions that can solve that problem.\nBlockchain will be in focus next years\nAB: Could you please name any particular companies you\u2019ve already worked with or would like to invest into?

The latest example of this came from EOS \u2014 a competitor with Ethereum \u2014 when a user figured out how to broadcast a fake transaction to the network for 1 trillion EOS (a single transfer for $3.6 trillion).\nWhile the incident was entirely harmless, it cast doubts on the sanctity of a platform that\u2019s meant to oust Ethereum from its position as the de facto decentralized computer. Using an exploit in an EOS idea called deferred transactions, the user set up a payment that would be settled at a later date \u2014 and it was published to the network, even though it was 1,000 times as large as the EOS market cap itself.\nEOS block producers EOS New York noted that the transaction that created the deferred incident can only determine whether the create request was submitted or whether it failed, thus getting around the limitations. Once that happened, \u201cit is subject to normal validity checks.\u201d These events cast the upstart \u201cEthereum-killer\u201d in a less-than-positive light, but they do create an opportunity for an updated, in-depth look into this promising platform.\nThe EOS evolutionary timeline\nEOS is an auspicious blockchain project and remains a top market contender, vying for fifth on the list of top market capitalizations at any given moment. It began as a competitor to Ethereum in 2017, arriving as that solution began demonstrating issues with scaling and transaction speed. EOS had similar ideas: decentralized storage, bandwidth and incentives. In turn, EOS announced its intention to create a similar idea to Ethereum but with a different consensus, mining and other foundational concepts that would solve Ethereum\u2019s transactional bottlenecks.\n\nThe initial coin offering (ICO) for EOS was astoundingly successful, thanks to its ambitious timeline, outlook and circumstantial trends. It garnered over $4 billion worth of ETH, setting records but, at the same time, demonstrating the inflated the value of most cryptos and the sector\u2019s unsustainable optimism.\nEOS\u2019s founding team, Block.one, accordingly owned one of the fattest ETH wallets, using it it to push EOS through several releases and upgrades, sponsor international partnerships, launch a bug-bounty program, and deliver a working mainnet. The latest release, EOS 1.6, released in January 2019, brought with it upgrades including enhanced tools for smart contract development and faster remote data processing.\nDApps on EOS are plentiful, and many of the most-used DApps are from EOS rather than competitors like Tron and Ethereum. While games such as BetHash and PokerEOS find audiences, blockchain development companies like LiquidApps use EOS as their permanent sandbox \u2014 and not only make working with it more fluid, but have also released new platforms like vRAM, which is a decentralized, Virtual\u00a0RAM storage solution that is much more efficient than any alternatives.\nHowever, various successes of the EOS platform aren\u2019t substantial enough to hide its flaws. LiquidApps CEO and co-founder Beni Hakak notes about EOS that \u201cblockchains today don\u2019t yet scale. EOS [...] which has solved many issues on the transaction speed side, still has resource limitations which are critical for the extensive dApp developer that is so needed for user adoption.\u201d\nThough several DApps have been deployed, the platform has been found lacking in many ways in 2019 alone, and the circumstances of its existence beg serious questions about the blockchain fundraising model and the ability of other firms to produce innovations reliably.\nPeter Todd, who has expressed bearish views on EOS at times, claims that the platform\u2019s problems are features rather than bugs. Speaking of EOS\u2019 scalability, Todd notes that \u201cit was more likely than not deliberately designed to be terrible,\u201d so that it would make it difficult to access the validator set, due to its permissioned nature. The result is less competition and an unscalable platform.\nEOS exploits display blockchain discrepancies", "birthday": "2019-03-20T14:16:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-20 14:16:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 20}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the\u00a0HitBTC exchange.\nThe crypto markets are showing the first signs of bottoming out. Most cryptocurrencies are well above their yearly lows and are starting new uptrends. Every bull phase has a new set of leaders. Therefore, it is important to note the digital currencies that are pulling the market higher, as these are the ones that are likely to outperform during the move upwards.\nBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) dominance continues to drop gradually since reaching a high of about 57.80 percent in mid-September. This shows that the market participants are loading up on altcoins. However, a new bull phase cannot start without support from the leading cryptocurrency.\nThe good news regarding Bitcoin is that it has stopped falling and is gradually moving higher. Its volume topped $11 billion over the 24-hour period on March 15, a level not seen since April 25 of last year. This shows that market participants are gradually turning bullish on the leading cryptocurrency.\nAs the crypto universe emerges from its prolonged bear phase, there will be periods when Bitcoin will lead and other times when altcoins will lead. So, traders should change their strategy accordingly.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) is the best performing major cryptocurrency of the past week. It rallied on the back of favorable news, as Coinbase Pro announced support for Stellar on March 13. This move will likely eventually lead to full support on Coinbase\u2019s other platforms. The appointment of Denelle Dixon, former chief operating officer at Mozilla, as the CEO and executive director of Stellar Development Foundation also served as bullish news.\nAdditionally, IBM\u2019s push to create a stablecoin targeting blockchain-powered cross-border payment solutions for banks involves a partnership with the altcoin in the form of Blockchain World Wire. The question is, can this adoption and development-based rally continue or will it hit a roadblock ahead? Let\u2019s take a look at the charts.\n\nThe XLM/USD pair is in a downtrend. Both the moving averages are still down and the RSI is in the negative zone. Currently, it is attempting to pullback from the lows, which will face resistance at $0.14861760 and above it at the downtrend line.\nWe are yet to see a higher high and a higher low being formed, which will indicate that the downtrend is over. Therefore, for long-term investors, we don\u2019t see any reliable buy setups yet. If the pair turns down from the 20-week EMA, it will again attempt a breakdown to new lows. \u00a0\u00a0\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) was the second-best performer for the week, rising about 15 percent. Though there was apparently no specific news driving prices higher, the digital currency has a history of vertical rallies and waterfall declines. Let\u2019s see where it goes from here.\n\nAfter many small range weeks, the BCH/USD pair is looking to move up. The current move is likely to carry it to the 20-week EMA, which is just below the horizontal resistance of $239. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of $239, we anticipate the pair to pick up momentum and rally to $400. The digital currency has a history of sharp rallies; hence, the target might surprise to the upside.\nContrary to our assumption, if the cryptocurrency turns down from $239, it might extend its stay in the range for a few more weeks. It will turn negative if the bears sink the price below $105.\nADA/USD\nCardano (ADA) announced this week that it will be one of the founding members of the \u00a0European Commission\u2019s International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications. The association is an effort to identify the improvements blockchain technology can bring to various industries and formulate a common approach for the European Union.\n\nThe ADA/USD pair has been range bound between $0.036815 and $0.051468. We like it when a digital currency forms a large basing pattern after a prolonged downtrend. Previous attempts to breakout or breakdown of the range did not find any takers.\nCurrently, the bulls are trying to breakout of the range once again. The 20-week EMA is just above this level, which might also act as a roadblock. If the digital currency scales above the 20-week EMA, we anticipate a quick rally to $0.082952 and above it to $0.094256. Therefore, traders can buy on a weekly close (UTC time frame) above $0.051468 and keep a stop loss of $0.0350.\nOpposite to our expectations, if the digital currency turns down from the current levels, it will extend it stay in the range for a few more weeks. A breakdown of the range will be a negative sign that can result in a retest of the lows, below which the downtrend will resume.\nDASH/USD\nDash (DASH) has been making huge inroads in Venezuela as the citizens look at various available avenues to deal with the unstable Bolivar and foreign sanctions, which threaten to derail SWIFT, Visa and MasterCard services. Dash Text has come up with a charity system that is devoid of any human third-party intervention. The donations are directly distributed among the pool of recipients. In other news, Equicex Group, the provider of privacy-focused debit cards, has decided to integrate Dash, which increases the options available for Dash users.\n\nThe DASH/USD pair continues to trade between $56.214 and $103.261. The bulls are attempting to push prices above the resistance of the range. The 20-week EMA is placed just below $103.261 levels. We expect the bears to defend this resistance. If the price turns down, then the consolidation will stretch out for a few more weeks. The trend will turn negative if the bears sink the digital currency below the range.", "birthday": "2019-03-17T22:14:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-17 22:14:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 17}

But, financiers and investors fear a \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit \u2014 in which the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a trade agreement at the end of the month \u2014 could again destabilize Ireland\u2019s boom-and-bust economy.\nThe U.K. received 11 percent of Ireland\u2019s exports of goods in the past year, while supplying more than one-fifth of its imports. The Irish central bank conjectures that an orderly exit from the EU would decrease the gross domestic product by 1.5 percent, according to a Reuters story.\nWhile the economic uncertainty \u2014 like in many countries \u2014 has driven curiosity in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and others in Ireland ahead of Brexit, it casts a shadow over a burgeoning blockchain boom.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see beyond the shadow of Brexit at the moment,\u201d said Dave Fleming, global head of research and development for Mastercard Labs in Ireland. \u201cIf Ireland is affected, it will probably be similar to 2008 and the whole world might be affected so possibly blockchains might help.\u201d The Irish will have to wait and see, he says.\nIreland\u2019s hope\nIf Britain leaves without agreeing to terms on the border with Northern Ireland, a more strongly enforced border could partially isolate Ireland and reignite conflict. According to Anthony Day, chief operating officer of Deloitte\u2019s EMEA Blockchain Lab in Ireland, Brexit brings to mind the concept of a \u201cdigital border\u201d between Ireland and the U.K. As Day explained:\n\u201cWe see significant potential for Blockchain to provide the capability to enable secure, real-time and automated infrastructure to support trade, reporting, and the movement of goods and people. However, establishing the relevant working groups, governance, deploying such platforms and completing the necessary transformation within both public and private sector organizations would be a multi-year initiative, and the timescale for Brexit is immediate.\u201d\nBrexit has dampened Irish consumer confidence and stymied foreign investment. Ireland\u2019s biggest companies are drawing up backup plans in case of a no-deal Brexit. Business owners fear tariffs, customs paperwork and delayed shipments of goods from Britain. AIB, Ireland\u2019s biggest bank, said this past Monday that one-third of companies have canceled or postponed investments because of Brexit.\n\u201cA Brexit \u2018no deal\u2019 is clearly the biggest concern,\u201d said Raul Sinha, a banking analyst at JPMorgan Chase.\nCryptocurrency and Ireland\nAccording to Day, blockchain is flourishing in Ireland. The exchange Coinbase, development company Consensys, and Wachsman PR have all opened offices in Dublin. Deloitte deliberately chose Dublin as the home for the EMEA Lab and invested in a dedicated facility.\nDay notes that the Irish government has committed 500 million euros toward its Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund. Through the fund, business and research groups can apply for funding to progress blockchain and other technologies.\n\u201cFrom a Blockchain perspective,\u201d Day said, \u201cwe have seen strong engagement from across Ireland\u2019s major sectors (Financial Services, Food & Agriculture, Technology, Aviation and others) in applying Blockchain to address established industry pain points such as transparency, data sharing, fraud and driving efficiency in trading activity.\u201d Fleming also sees many big enterprises adopting blockchain:\n\u201cWell, as far as I can see, there is a massive uptake of crypto inside financial firms. From people I have talked to inside the industry, I\u2019d say most firms, including the Big 4, as well as most of the banks located here, will be moving most of their verification methods to the blockchain within a few years. People from all over the tech sector are picking up crypto and figuring it out.\u201d \u00a0\nConsenSys, which opened an office in Dublin last year, remains active in the city.\n\u201cWhat is surprising is the amount of blockchain activity taking place in Ireland,\u201d ConsenSys Ireland MD Lory Kehoe told Cointelegraph. \u201cWhile the blockchain eco-system is relatively new in Ireland we are seeing rapid development of the market here.\u201d\n\nKehoe cites working groups like Blockchain Ireland (BI), a group of government and private companies and individuals, as a big part of the development of the ecosystem there:\n\u201cIreland has a number of fantastic third level programmes in computer science and also a talent center of thousands of people who have come to work for some of the major social and tech companies that have their EMEA headquarters here.\u201d", "birthday": "2019-03-18T18:52:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-18 18:52:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 18}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nEthereum (ETH) co-founder Joseph Lubin expects the global economy to grow 10 times in the next 10 to 20 years, powered by the mass use of blockchain technology. According to him, the current condition of the nascent space is similar to the use of email in 1983, when only a handful of early adopters were using it.\nTyler and Cameron Winklevoss, founders of the Gemini crypto exchange, have welcomed Facebook\u2019s rumored stablecoin. However, they said that cryptocurrencies will usher in a greater disruptive development compared to the social networking platforms.\nGradually, large traditional players in various fields are recognizing the power of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, partnering with various startups to gain the first mover advantage. Different nations are also not leaving any stone unturned to make the most of the budding technology.\nThese developments are positive for the future. Nevertheless, the price is yet to respond to improved fundamentals. What do the charts of the major cryptocurrencies project? Let\u2019s find out.\nBTC/USD\nThough Bitcoin (BTC) has been rising above the psychological resistance of $4,000 for the past three days, it has not been able to sustain it. This shows profit booking at higher levels. If the price doesn\u2019t close above $4,000 soon, we anticipate a mild correction to the 20-day EMA and below it to the uptrend line.\nIf the digital currency rebounds sharply from either of the supports and breaks out of $4,000, it will be a positive sign. It is then likely to rally to $4,255, which is a major hurdle. A close (UTC time frame) above $4,255 will complete a double bottom, which has a pattern target of $5,273.91.\nCurrently, both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory. Hence, the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the BTC/USD pair dips below the moving averages. On a fall below the 50-day SMA, the pair can drop to $3,355. Below this level, the final support is at $3,236.09. The downtrend will resume if the bears sink the price to a new yearly low.\nTraders can retain the stop loss on the long positions below $3,236.09. We shall soon trail the stops higher to reduce the risk. We might suggest adding long positions on a close above $4,255.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) failed to sustain above $144.78 on March 16. This shows a lack of buying at higher levels. The price has again dipped back to the 20-day EMA, below which a fall to $134.50 is probable. Both the moving averages have started to slope up, which indicates a minor advantage to the bulls.\n\nA breakout and close above $144.78 can result in a move to the next overhead resistance of $167.32. If this level is also crossed, it will complete a bullish ascending triangle pattern that has a target objective of $251.64.\nOn the other hand, if the ETH/USD pair plunges below the moving averages, it can slide to the trendline of the ascending triangle pattern. Traders can keep the stops on the remaining long positions at $125.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) has been trading close to the moving averages for the past few days. This period of consolidation is unlikely to continue for long. We expect a decisive breakout or a breakdown within the next few days.\n\nA breakout of $0.33108 will propel the XRP/USD pair to the resistance line of the descending channel. If the bulls succeed in pushing the price above the channel, we expect the pair to pick up momentum and start a new uptrend.\nOn the other hand, if the digital currency plunges below the uptrend line of the ascending triangle, it can drop to the next support at $0.27795. Below this level, a drop to $0.24508 is possible. Traders can protect their long positions with the stop loss just below $0.27795.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) broke above the resistance line on March 16, but it is facing profit booking at higher levels. If the price rebounds off $56.910, it will indicate strength and a rally to $65.561 is probable. Above this level, the up move can extend to $69.2790. Though the price has been moving up, the RSI has failed to catch up. This negative divergence on the RSI is worrying us. Traders can trail the stops on the remaining long positions to $52.\n\nWe are not recommending booking complete profits at the current levels because, in a bull phase, the negative divergence on the RSI can often give a false signal. Notwithstanding, since it is a warning sign, we have proposed trailing the stops to protect the paper profits.\nIf the LTC/USD pair breaks down of the 20-day EMA, it can slide to the next support at $47.2460. The 50-day SMA is just below this level. A breakdown of this support will indicate weakness.\nEOS/USD\nEOS has been struggling to breakout of $3.8723, but is finding support close to the 20-day EMA. Both the moving averages are gradually trending up, and the RSI is in the positive territory, which shows that the bulls have a slight edge.\n\nIf the EOS/USD pair sustains above $3.8723, it can move up to $4.4930. But if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA, a fall to $3.1534 is probable. Below this support, the trend will turn in favor of the bears. Therefore, traders can retain the stops on the remaining long positions at $3.1. We shall soon trail it higher.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has quickly risen to the overhead resistance of $163.89. The attempt to breakout and sustain above it has failed. Still, with the 20-day EMA starting to slope up and the RSI in the overbought zone, the path of least resistance is to the upside. Above $163.89, it can rally to $175 and above it to $220.\n\nIf the BCH/USD pair fails to scale above $163.89, it will again slide back to the 20-day EMA. The trend will turn negative if the bears sink the price below $120.46, and traders can retain the stop loss on the long positions at $116. We shall watch for a couple of days and then recommend trailing the stops higher.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) broke out of the overhead resistance at $15.9100517 on March 16. We expected it to continue higher after breaking out of the resistance. However, the digital currency is stuck near the breakout levels for the past two days.\n\nA breakout of $16.6442826 can propel the BNB/USD pair to its target objective of $18. Both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, which shows that the bulls have the upper hand.\nHowever, if the price again slips back below $15.9100517, it will indicate profit booking at higher levels. The support on the downside is at the uptrend line and below it at 20-day EMA. If the 20-day EMA breaks down, the short-term trend will turn in favor of the bears. Therefore, please trail the stop loss on the remaining long positions to $14.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) is consolidating near the recent swing high, which is a positive sign. The 20-day EMA is sloping upward and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which suggests that the bulls are in command.\n\nOn the upside, the XLM/USD pair has to breakout of the resistance line to pick up momentum. The targets are $0.13250273 and above it, $0.14861760.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and slips below the 20-day EMA. In such a case, a fall to the uptrend line is probable. The traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions at $0.08.\nTRX/USD\nThough Tron (TRX) broke out of the 20-day EMA on March 16, it turned back from the 50-day SMA. The bulls could not keep up the buying pressure and it is currently struggling to hold the 20-day EMA.\n", "birthday": "2019-03-18T14:44:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-18 14:44:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 18}

This time around, the partnership also included the National Cybersecurity Center, a nonprofit that works to raise awareness of cyber threats to the integrity of election systems.\nWhereas in West Virginia elections last year just about\u00a0150 people opted in to cast ballots via their mobile devices, the Denver campaign in May could see a much wider utilization of the technology. The target voting population is both service members and overseas citizen voters from the city and county of Denver, totaling around 4,000 people.\nAs the idea of using distributed ledger technology to record the expression of citizens\u2019 electoral preference is still met with near-universal suspicion, this trial might become the largest blockchain-facilitated campaign to fill political offices in the United States to date.\n\nForging the partnership\nTusk Philanthropies is on a mission to fix American democracy by means of dramatically increasing voter turnout \u2014 which should, in turn, improve the quality of political representation. They believe in\u00a0mobile voting as a shortcut to more inclusive elections. Blockchain technology is an integral part of the organization\u2019s strategy, due to the security and auditability that it brings to the process. At the same time, Sheila Nix, president of Tusk Philanthropies, made it clear in an email to Cointelegraph that the organization views the technology as an instrument rather than an end goal, and it remains open to an alternative solution, should it prove more useful:\n\u201cBlockchain is the most secure option that exists right now but we are vendor and technology agnostic and are open to new solution in the future. We think there is a lot of growth potential for blockchain-based voting \u2014 especially due to the auditability features.\u201d\nAlways on the outlook of expanding their ambitious mobile voting program, the Tusk Philanthropies leadership began talking with the city of Denver and the National Cybersecurity Center last year. The foundation was attracted by the city\u2019s \u201cstrong reputation in the area of elections\u201d and saw the opportunity to move mobile voting ahead.\nFor Denver Elections Division, the two major selling points were convenience and security. Out of the two, security was paramount, so the city government engaged in a meticulous vetting process before giving the project a thumbs-up. As Jocelyn Bucaro, the unit\u2019s deputy director of elections, recounted:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been following the pilot in West Virginia very closely. We\u2019ve conducted several demonstrations with Voatz and another vendor, and we ultimately decided, after talking with the West Virginia Secretary of State office, after Voatz went through a rigorous security review by our tech services team and after seeing the review conducted by Tusk Philanthropies of the security of the vendor, and after working with them to make improvements even over the West Virginia pilot last year to their application, we felt that it was appropriate for us to pilot this for our military and overseas citizen voters in municipal election cycle.\u201d\nInterestingly, the initiative took off without any involvement on behalf of the famously pro-blockchain Colorado Governor and former U.S. Representative Jared Polis, who hadn\u2019t even announced his candidacy for governor at the time the project was conceived. Bucaro and her colleagues, however, sought some input from the Colorado Blockchain Council, whose several members were involved in the demonstrations.\nLimited application\nBucaro also pointed out that mobile voting in the Denver election is not meant to replace paper-based ballots. Rather, it will be used to facilitate the process for a specific group of absentee voters \u2014 those who serve in the military or live overseas \u2014 and who are currently using email to return their ballots to election administrators:\n\u201cMilitary and overseas voters fall under an overseas statute that requires us to email them a ballot, if they choose to receive their ballot by email. Colorado law also permits them to return their ballot electronically. So this voting population was already able to receive a ballot that they could mark on a hosted website, and then generally they would email the ballot back to us as a PDF attachment to an email \u2014 which is not a very secure method of return, which is why this method using blockchain secure encryption, a distributed ledger that can\u2019t be changed, offers a higher degree of security and auditability than simply an email attachment.\u201d\nEligible voters will be required to request an absentee ballot, install the Voatz application, and go through the biometric authentication process. Identity verification entails submitting a photograph of voter\u2019s government-issued ID and a 10-second \u201cselfie\u201d video. Once this is out of the way, the app permits the user to cast their vote, which it records to a distributed ledger. This is where the convenience part comes in: Each stage of the procedure doesn\u2019t require anything except a cell phone, in contrast to the trouble of printing out, filling out and scanning paper ballots before emailing them as a PDF attachment.\nThe initial response from Denver\u2019s military and overseas voters was rather enthusiastic. In less than one day following the announcement, some 90 people signed up to vote via their phones in the upcoming municipal election cycle. This showing, as Jocelyn Bucaro notes, is a good reason to be optimistic:\n\u201cGenerally speaking, our overseas voters tend to participate in municipal elections at much lower rate than in federal elections. They don\u2019t live here, so they are not as connected to who\u2019s on city council or who\u2019s running for mayor, so these elections have a much lower turnout among that population. So we were pretty excited to see almost 90 people sign up in just the first day after we\u2019ve sent this newsletter out.\u201d\nScaling hurdles\nDespite the Denver pilot being a step forward in terms of expanding the potential number of voters involved, it still confines the use of the mobile platform to a very specific and narrow population. Given the pushback against the idea of using blockchain as a primary technological infrastructure in mainstream voting on behalf of the majority of influential election technology experts, it would be too bold to predict that the future of ubiquitous mobile voting is just around the corner.\nAs Cointelegraph\u00a0reported last year, even West Virginia\u2019s Secretary of State Mac Warner, who exuberantly reported on the success of the state\u2019s trailblazing effort, made a point to emphasize that he will never advocate for using blockchain-powered voting solutions beyond overseas absentees.", "birthday": "2019-03-18T19:48:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-18 19:48:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 18}

Because one of the most important links in this chain of security is your own self.\nYes, what good is a securely held private key if thieves force you at gunpoint to tell them what this key is? This might seem like an improbable risk for anyone with only modest savings in crypto, but for anyone with hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin in their wallets, it's all too real. The kidnappings of\u00a0Pavel Lerner and\u00a0Skycoin's \u201cSynth\u201d underline this point forcefully, so it's no wonder that an increasing number of crypto millionaires and CEOs are choosing to enlist the services of personal bodyguards.\nHowever, while it's clear that a large number of \u201ccryptonaires\u201d currently make use of bodyguards, it's likely that third-party solutions to personal security may soon emerge and make them less necessary. It's also possible that the safety of high-profile figures will improve in parallel with an increase in regulations and the standardization of the industry, since, in some cases, it would seem that threats to security are associated with the questionable business practices of those threatened.\nBeing your own bank carries risks\nTadas Kasputis is one of the many cryptocurrency executives who now employs the services of personal bodyguards. For a while, the founder of\u00a0CoinStruction and the\u00a0ExMarkets crypto-exchange didn't see any use for them, but he tells Cointelegraph that this changed in 2015, after he was kidnapped.\n\"Yes, actually I was kidnapped in my hometown Kaunas city in Lithuania,\" he said. \"They came out of nowhere, pushed me into a van and drove around town trying to get me to tell them my bitcoin wallet passwords. Their plan did not work and they're now facing charges in Lithuanian court. That was the only time it happened, but it was enough.\"\nAs a result of this incident, Kasputis states that he \"decided to put extra security measures to protect me and my family,\" although he didn\u2019t specify the extent of the protection he now pays for (perhaps for security reasons). And he's not alone in taking additional security measures, because even though most cryptocurrency executives are understandably sheepish when it comes to divulging specific details, there's ample online record of such execs using bodyguards.\nMost notably, Ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio is one of these figures. While he didn't reply to a request for comment, a\u00a0Fortune interview from June describes him walking around Manhattan with a private bodyguard, while a\u00a0November article from The Globe and Mail offers further detail, revealing that he employs seven full-time bodyguards.\n\"Being my own bank, there are consequences \u2014 I\u2019m at risk,\" he told the Canadian newspaper, offering a vivid indication of just how threatened some of the more conspicuous figures in the cryptocurrency industry feel.\nA few of the biggest names in the industry have taken Di Iorio's lead and publicly stated how many bodyguards they employ and in what specific capacity (i.e., whether full-time or not). Still, it's known that Litecoin creator Charlie Lee, for example, has his own \"head of security,\" John Kim, who \u2014 in between acting as Lee's personal bodyguard \u2014 also doubles as an \"evangelist\" for the altcoin. And as with Kasputis, there are many other lesser known crypto figures who have been known to use personal security, such as \"the Dollar Vigilante\"\u00a0Jeff Berwick and the\u00a0now-jailed Josh Garza (who was known to\u00a0attend conferences with two bodyguards in tow).\nBerwick explained to Cointelegraph:\n\u201cFor my entire life I've deemed it my own duty to supply protection to myself and my family. For that reason, aside from being a trained fighter and often armed, I always utilize private security services in one way or another. \u00a0I would never, under any circumstance, leave my security up to a centrally planned, communist style, bureaucratic and slow, dog killing, kidnapping and extortion racket like government police.\u201d\nAdmittedly, a list of five names doesn't offer a very comprehensive window into just how many people in crypto actually walk around with hired muscle. That said, bodyguard firms have been reporting that they're increasingly working for people in the industry, with a Bitcoin.com article from last year showing that this is especially true in Russia. Yet, this is also the case elsewhere in the world, with the United Kingdom-based\u00a0Spetsnaz Security International, for instance, informing Cointelegraph that it does have clients in the crypto industry.\n\"I do provide bodyguard services for individuals who work in the cryptocurrency industry,\" says director Fidel Matola, who, unfortunately, wouldn't share the number of such individuals his agency works for. Nonetheless, there's little doubt that a not- insignificant proportion of people in the industry do use personal security, even if some of the most notable members of the crypto elite still apparently don't (e.g.,\u00a0Vitalik Buterin).\n\u201cMost people I know are anarcho-capitalist and therefore use private security regularly,\u201d notes Berwick, who currently resides in an informal anarchist community in Acapulco and organizes the annual Anarchapulco event. Although he adds, \u201cI haven't particularly noticed an increase in this usage amongst people I know.\u201d\nEastern Europe or the rest of world?\nWhile it isn't controversial to assert that crypto millionaires (or billionaires) do use bodyguards, there are a number of questions surrounding this phenomenon that aren't so obvious. For one, it would be useful to know where in the world bodyguards are most widely used by members of the crypto elite. And while it's tempting to suggest that the answer to this question is Russia and Eastern Europe, people who actually live in this region aren't so sure. According to Kasputis:\n\"I don't know the statistics and aren't too concerned about them. Perhaps the cases are more common in Eastern Europe right now, but the cryptocurrency penetration and popularity in this region is also higher than, say, in South America, right? Maybe the geographical scope will change.\"\nGiven that there aren't any statistics on this subject, it's very difficult to conclude anything with any certainty, particularly when Di Iorio is based in Canada, for example, when Berwick is based in Mexico, and Garza was based in the U.S.\nAnd Berwick, for his part, believes that it\u2019s not Eastern Europe that\u2019s the most dangerous area in the world for cryptocurrency holders, but rather, the United States. Although, in his case, he regards the danger posed in the US in more general terms, and not restricted solely to Bitcoin or Ethereum holders who might be robbed at gunpoint:\n\u201cThe most dangerous place in the world, in my opinion, is the US. Nearly everyone in the US gets extorted for half the money they make every year and are extorted on thousands of other items as well. When not being extorted they live in the world's largest police state where most people at one point or another are kidnapped and thrown into rape camps [prisons]. I try to avoid going to the US for this reason.\u201d\nDespite Berwick\u2019s impassioned testimony, it's interesting to note that Lerner was kidnapped in Kiev, Kasputis was kidnapped in Lithuania, and that there have been numerous\u00a0instances of people being robbed for crypto in\u00a0Moscow over the past couple of years. There are, then, good reasons to suspect that bodyguards might be more common in Eastern Europe, even if the the rest of the crypto world (particularly in the Americas) probably also has its fair share.\nThird-party protection\nCases of kidnap and robbery are highly disturbing for anyone with significant crypto holdings, and it might seem that the only response to such incidents is to turn to the nearest reliable personal security agency. But even if this may be a perfectly rational response right now, it's possible that it might not be necessary in the near future. As Kasputis argues:\n\"I think soon enough there will be accessible solutions in the cryptocurrency space which will allow putting your holdings into trusted-third-party protection similar to what we have bank vaults right now. There are still many business opportunities out there, one, for example, being crypto wills and arrangements of the digital asset and private key transfers upon death. I am not the one to evaluate the QuadrigaCX controversy, but it is a good example of that.\"\nThis might simply sound like speculation, but there is, in fact, a move toward \"third-party protection\" for cryptocurrencies in the security industry. Back in October, the London-based multinational security company G4S\u00a0announced that it had launched a \"vault storage\" service for crypto. The corporation has copious experience protecting and storing money and high-value items, and it's now using this experience to provide a service that breaks up a client's cryptocurrency into \"fragments,\" which are then kept in a number of high-security vaults.\nBy \"fragments,\" G4S is presumably referring to private keys and/or seed words rather than cryptocurrencies themselves. Regardless, G4S Risk Consulting's senior risk analyst, Dominic MacIver, noted at the time that this service isn't being proposed merely as a bulwark against hacking, but also against physical robbery:", "birthday": "2019-03-19T01:20:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-19 01:20:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 19}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nIn a recent interview, United States Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton said that he is concerned about manipulation and custody services in the crypto space. If these issues are addressed and if any Bitcoin ETF satisfies their rules, it might stand a chance of getting the green light.\nWhile crypto markets are speculating on the probability of a Bitcoin ETF, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), has announced that it will not be offering any new Bitcoin futures contracts in March. This is likely to benefit its competitor CME, which will continue to provide the traders with an opportunity to trade in Bitcoin futures.\nFundstrat Global Advisors founder Tom Lee believes that the fundamentals of Bitcoin are improving. He expects a turnaround by August of this year. On the way up, he anticipates $6,000 to act as a major resistance.\nLet\u2019s see what our analysis projects. \u00a0\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) is trying to bounce off the 20-day EMA and rise above the psychological resistance of $4,000. Both the moving averages are gradually sloping up and the 20-day EMA has held in the past few days, which shows buying at lower levels. We expect the digital currency to pick up momentum above $4,000 and quickly rally to $4,255. If the bulls scale this level, it will complete a double bottom pattern that has a target objective of $5,273.91.\n\nOn the contrary, if the BTC/USD pair again turns down from $4,000 and breaks below the uptrend line and the 50-day SMA, it will indicate profit booking and aggressive short initiation at higher levels.\nThe critical zone to watch on the downside is $3,355\u2013$3,236.09. A breakdown of this zone will be very negative. The downtrend will resume if the digital currency plunges to a new 52-week low. Therefore, traders can keep the stop loss on the existing long positions below $3,236.09. We will soon trail the stops higher.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) has successfully held the support at $134.50. The bulls are trying to push the price towards $144.78. Both the moving averages are flat and the RSI is also close to the center. This suggests equilibrium between buyers and sellers.\n\nIf the ETH/USD pair picks up momentum and breaks out of $144.78, it can rally to the critical overhead resistance of $167.32. Above this level, the ascending triangle completes that has a pattern target of $251.64.\nThe trend will weaken if the digital currency drops below 50-day SMA. The next support on the downside is $116.30. The uptrend line of the ascending triangle is also at this level; hence, we expect this to hold. A break below the uptrend line will invalidate the bullish pattern, which is a negative sign. Traders can protect the remaining long positions with stops at $125.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) has been clinging to the uptrend line of the developing ascending triangle for the past few days. Both the moving averages are flat and the RSI is at the midpoint, which points to a balance between demand and supply.\n\nIf the XRP/USD pair slips below the uptrend line, it can drop to the support at $0.27795. A breakdown of this level can retest the yearly low at $0.24508. Therefore, traders holding long positions can keep the stop loss just below $0.27795.\nOn the other hand, if the pair spurts higher from the current levels and rises above $0.33108, it can move up to the resistance line of the descending channel. A breakout of the channel will indicate a likely change in trend.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) again took support close to the 20-day EMA on March 14. Currently, the bulls have pushed the price above the overhead resistance of $56.910, which is a bullish sign. The next resistance on the upside is $59.4494. If the bulls succeed in scaling this level, we anticipate a rally to $65.5610 and above it to $69.2790.\n\nWhile the up-trending moving averages are bullish, the negative divergence on the RSI is worrying us. If the RSI breaks out of the resistance line, it will be another positive sign.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the LTC/USD pair breaks down of the 20-day EMA and drops to $47.2460. Traders can retain the stops on the remaining long positions at $50.\nEOS/USD\nEOS has been holding above the 20-day EMA for the past four days. Repeated attempts by the bears to sink the price below this level have failed, which shows buying at lower levels.\n\nBoth the moving averages are gradually moving higher and the RSI has also turned up. We expect the bulls to make another attempt to scale above the overhead resistance of $3.8723 and rally towards $4.4930.\nHowever, if the EOS/USD pair turns down from current levels and slips below the 20-day EMA, it will correct to $3.1534. The 50-day SMA is also at this level, hence, we expect this support to hold. But if the bears sink the pair below the 50-day SMA, it can correct to $2.1733. Therefore, traders can keep their stops on the remaining long positions at $3.10.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently attempting to sustain above the $120\u2013$140 range. The strong bounce from the 50-day SMA increases the probability of a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $140. Following the breakout, the move can extend to the next overhead zone of $157.95 to $163.89. As the digital currency has a history of vertical rallies, traders can trail their stops higher instead of booking profits at the above-mentioned levels. If the momentum picks up, the rally can reach $186.30 and above it $239.\n\nHowever, if the BCH/USD pair reverses direction from the current level, it will prolong its stay in the range for a few more days. It will turn negative on a breakdown of the range at $120. The next level to watch on the downside is $105. For now, traders can keep the stops on the long positions at $116.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) has been consolidating close to the overhead resistance of $15.9100517 for the past three days. It has not given up much ground, which suggests that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits on their positions.\n\nThe trend remains firmly up as both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought territory. This increases the possibility of an upward breakout that can carry the BNB/USD pair to $18. Therefore, traders can retain the stops on the remaining long positions at breakeven. We shall suggest trailing the stops higher next week.\nOur bullish assumption will prove to be wrong if the pair reverses direction from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA. The next support on the downside is the 50-day SMA.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) has been crawling higher for the past few days but is struggling to breakout of the resistance line. A breakout of the resistance line will propel it towards $0.13427050. With the 20-day EMA sloping up and the RSI close to the overbought level, the path of least resistance is to the upside. Traders can protect their long positions with a stop loss of $0.08.\n\nContrary to our assumption, if the XLM/USD pair fails to breakout of the resistance line, it can slide to the 20-day EMA and below it to the uptrend line. A breakdown of the uptrend line will indicate that the bears are back in the driver\u2019s seat and a retest of the low is probable.\nTRX/USD\nThough Tron (TRX) has been trading below the 20-day EMA for the past few days, the bears have not been able to sink it below $0.02094452. This suggests buying at lower levels.\n", "birthday": "2019-03-15T19:25:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-15 19:25:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 15}

Initially, opponents of the update prevailed over supporters by a margin of 96 percent, according to a Cointelegraph report on Feb. 15. The current scenario is exactly opposite, with 94 percent of voters favoring the implementation of ProgPoW, as evidenced by the Etherchain charts.\nWhat is ProgPoW?\nSimply put, ProgPoW is a version of the proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm, which is supposed to smooth the transition of the Ethereum network to proof-of-stake (PoS). As a part of this process, developers are exploring and proposing different solutions to fight off the mining difficulty bomb and make the network stable and resistant to attacks.\nOne of them is ProgPoW (programmatic proof-of-work), being designed by Ethereum developers to eliminate the gap in efficiency between Ethereum ASIC miners and graphics processing units (GPU) by making ASIC mining less efficient. This is necessary to protect the Ethereum network against a monopoly of ASIC hardware manufacturers.\nThe principle of the ProgPoW operation is slightly different from other algorithms that are resistant to ASIC miners. It is supposed to make the production of ASICs unprofitable since the manufacture process itself will require more financial and labor resources, and thus won\u2019t pay off.\nMaking GPU cards more competitive and reducing centralization will be possible through making the task condition for mining impermanent and using all the resources and potential of video cards. The issue is that ASIC miners are designed for one specific task in mind: calculating blocks for mining cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, video cards are flexible and can perform a number of tasks \u4e00 from mining to transmitting an image.\nUsing a random task sequence eliminates the possibility of creating a fixed pipeline, as it happens with ASIC miners. In other words, to work with ProgPoW, miners need to be flexible.\nDevelopers plan to reach such results with five innovations, under which the algorithm work will be based on computational capabilities, bandwidth and memory capacity.\n\nKeccak changes:\u00a0The Keccak hash function size has decreased from the 64-bit keccak-f1600 to the 32-bit keccak-f800. The latter has been optimized for 32-bit platforms for better compliance with the architecture of video cards.\nIncreased mix state: This is the number of processor registers in which intermediate values \u200b\u200bcan be stored. They are significantly faster than RAM, because they are located inside the processor. In ASIC miners, chips are small and the number of registers lags behind graphic processors in performance. As a result, ASICs are forced to use RAM to work with this feature, which is several times slower.\nAdding a random sequence of calculations in the main loop: The chip makes it impossible to create an ASIC device with a fixed pipeline, which could increase the speed of work or reduce consumption.\nAdding reads from a small, low-latency cache with random addresses support:\u00a0This causes ASICs to follow GPU memory hierarchy rules and limits their capabilities and performance.\nDRAM increased from 128 to 256 bytes: Bigger volumes favor video cards. Specialized ASICs are not able to optimize a memory controller for the sake of improved performance.\nWhy do we need ProgPoW?\nThe main reason for developing the ProgPoW algorithm is the influence that ASICs have on the cryptocurrency sphere, which jeopardizes the main principle of cryptocurrency \u4e00 decentralization \u4e00 for the sake of making larger profits. Both giants like Bitmain and Innosilicon, and new companies like ASICMiner and Spondoolies, which monopolized the market, became the main reason for finding solutions to prevent centralization.\nAt the moment, Ethash, which is expected to be replaced by ProgPoW, is considered the most ASIC-resistant algorithm. Meanwhile, among the most vulnerable to attacks algorithms \u4e00 Equihash, CryptoNight, X11 \u4e00 the efficiency of using ASICs exceeds that of GPU cards by several times. Ethash ASIC miners give users only a double advantage over video cards.\nOn April 3, 2018, Bitmain officially announced Antminer E3, capable of producing 180 mega-hashes per second (MH/s), with only 800 watts of power consumption. The ASIC miner model designed to mine ETH inspired other companies to join the ASIC hardware production, with unpleasant consequences for the Ethereum community \u4e00 mainly related to the issues of security and integrity.\nFirst of all, GPU farm owners started to suffer losses and lost interest in maintaining the network. In 2018, the revenues of the GPU cards producers fell and have been moving inexorably lower since then. Data provided by analytical company Jon Peddie for the Q4 of 2018 showed that total GPU shipments decreased by 2.65 percent from the preceding quarter, AMD shipments decreased by 6.8 percent, Nvidia decreased by 7.6 percent, and Intel's shipments decreased by 0.7 percent. In total, year-to-year GPU shipments decreased by 3.3 percent. Global technology company Susquehanna revealed that the monthly profit generated for mining ETH with GPU rigs had dropped from about $150 in the summer of 2017 to zero values in November.\n\nMoreover, hash rate and power became concentrated in fewer hands, which puts the network\u2019s decentralization and security at risk. The reason is the market dominance of such mining giants like Bitmain, which built up its monopoly by producing new ASICs for top coins. The ecosystem has become increasingly centralized and vulnerable to attacks since then.\nAs new coins appeared on the CoinMarketCap charts, Bitmain stamped mining devices, one after another, for Monero, SiaCoin, ZCash, Bitcoin Cash. Coin developers began to worry about the threat of a 51 percent attack \u4e00 a phenomenon when an attacker with 51 percent of a network\u2019s mining hash rate in their hands is able to manipulate the network.\nThe last straw was on April 3, when Bitmain developers announced the release of the \"world's most powerful and efficient EtHash ASIC\" for mining Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\nSince then, the Ethereum Foundation has been working on solving this problem, and as a result, the ProgPoW proposal appeared.\nPrecedents\nAt the moment there are not many programs for mining cryptocurrencies on the ProgPoW algorithm, possibly because of the existing equipment optimization problem. The first cryptocurrency on ProgPoW was Bitcoin Interest (BCI), which was switched to a new algorithm in September 2018. Its developers presented the first miner for the new algorithm.\nOne of the latest miners that received support from ProgPoW was the TT-Miner chip. It is closed-source software, available only for Windows and running on new Nvidia video cards. Additionally, this miner supports Ethash, UBQhash and MTP algorithms. The developers charge a commission of 1 percent, which is already included in all the devices.\nCommunity reaction and opponents\nThe new algorithm has caused a lot of controversy in the community since it not only protects the network against ASIC mining, but also allegedly gives an advantage to Nvidia video card owners over users who have AMD devices. Vitalik Buterin called it a distraction, while many other developers are skeptical of the new algorithm. In the guidelines for voting, Ethereum developers claimed that, due to a number of trolling messages appearing on social networks, they cannot understand which voting accounts are real:\n\u201cWe have noticed a lot of trolling and shills on both sides of the debates from anonymous accounts on forums, youtube, telegram, glitter, reddit and twitter. There is no way to know if these accounts are real people who actually have economic stakes in ethereum, or are simply fake troll or shill accounts funded by one side of the debate.\u201d\nThe developers also don\u2019t exclude a probability of resistance from miners, some of whom may be dissatisfied with the decline in already small incomes. This is evidenced by the relatively small support among the mining pools: Only 35 percent of them supported the upcoming update of the algorithm \u4e00 though Ethermine votes made up 36.5 percent and Sparkpool 27.6 percent of the total number of votes.\nEthermine is the largest Ethereum network pool, which controls 27 percent of its entire hashrate. It is not known how the voices are distributed within the pools, but it can be assumed that the users are divided approximately equally. Thus, for each person who loses revenue as a result of ProgPoW, there is one who may benefit from other miners leaving the network.\nEthereum users have reacted differently to the new algorithm, with some of them being concerned about the possible drop in revenues and others doubting whether this step will be efficient. Martin Koppelmann, CEO and co-founder of Gnosis, thinks that such a radical update should be implemented only if it\u2019s really necessary:\nI am against a #progPOW hardfork.To me there are only two legitimate reasons to hard fork Ethereum.1) Address an existential threat2) Bring Ethereum one step closer to a long term sustainable stable state#progPOW is tinkering in favour of one group (GPU miners) vs another.\u2014 Martin K\u00f6ppelmann (@koeppelmann) January 6, 2019\n\nJorge Izquierdo, co-founder of Aragon, agreed that ProgPoW is not the number one task for the development of the Ethereum network:\nIs anyone really considering changing the POW algorithm of Eth 1.0 now?I'm not interested in debating whether it is a good idea, just the fact that it shouldn't be a priority at all for Ethereum in 2019. Let's put all our energy towards POS pls. https://t.co/Pk1hPs0zTv\u2014 Jorge Izquierdo \ud83e\udd85 (@izqui9) January 7, 2019\n\nSome experts and users believe that the solution of making ASIC mining unprofitable may lead to more dramatic consequences than the reduction of miners.\nFor example, Eric Conner, developer of Ethhub.io, suggests that ProgPoW could lead to a chain split:\nIf ProgPoW causes a chain split, which is worse?1. ASIC use on the Ethereum network.2. Brand dilution of the Ethereum name via a chain split? https://t.co/HZXFPK2z8m\u2014 Eric Conner (@econoar) January 5, 2019\n\nAnother opposing point of view refers to using GPUs in countries with expensive electricity:\nStill not a fan of ProgPoW, it's not good to run GPU's at this high power usages for countries with higher electricity costs than 0.20$/kwh, it might eliminate whole Europe this way amd gets kinda centralized in USA, Iceland and Chinese farms due to low power costs\u2014 BuriedONE (@BuriedOne) March 2, 2019\n\nA number of miners and companies are also concerned about the fact that dominant ASIC producers may manufacture new hardware capable of working on ProgPoW. In particular, the co-founder of Sia, David Vorick, suggested that the new algorithm release won\u2019t stop ASIC producers, and some of them might be able to secretly develop suitable devices in order to prevent possible hard forks.\nAlexey Akhunov, one of Ethereum developers, said in a reply message:\n\u201cIf we want to obsolete the current EtHash mining devices, but at the same time not to induce more secretive behaviour on the part of ASIC manufacturers, we need to \u2018embrace\u2019 it and switch to an ASIC-friendly algorithm now instead of an ASIC-unfriendly algorithm. Which [is] the opposite of what we are doing.\u201d\nVorik also assumed that there are several large companies interested in producing special hardware for mining ETH, and the release of such devices would only be a matter of time.\nConspiracy theories\nThe conspiracy theories are vigorously discussed on the internet, and according to one, the team allegedly working on ProgPoW represents the interests of the leading manufacturers of GPUs \u4e00 Nvidia and AMD.", "birthday": "2019-03-14T10:14:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-14 10:14:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 14}

It\u2019s that pushback that has placed many companies in a difficult position \u2014 fearful of falling behind competitors, but wary of investing in a technology that may not require proprietary solutions.\nThe dilemma is reflected in the mix of comments in the enterprise vs. public chain debate.\nSky Guo, CEO of Cypherium, a startup offering enterprise-ready blockchain solutions, said to Forbes that enterprises no longer question whether blockchain is worth the attention but that, on the contrary, they are now proactively seeking new ways of incorporating this technology in their legacy systems.\nThis is something Leanne Kemp, CEO and founder of Everledger, a global digital registry for diamonds powered by the IBM enterprise blockchain platform, would agree with. Kemp, who won the 2018 Advance Award for technology, indicated that the introduction of enterprise blockchain solutions has the potential to completely revolutionize traditional supply chains, not just for the diamond trade:\n\u201cWhere we\u2019re at in terms of the world for 2030 and 2050 and beyond, we have to rethink supply chains. We have to think about how do we re-imagine product in market. We started with diamonds but our vision is much grander than diamonds.\u201d\nThe difference between enterprise and public blockchains\nEnterprise (also called private) blockchains and public blockchains share a number of characteristics. Both consist of a distributed peer-to-peer network, where the network is governed and maintained through a consensus protocol. Both types also provide some level of immutability of the network to prevent malicious attempts by individual participants to manipulate the data stored on the blockchain\nThat is as far as the commonalities go, and there are a number of key differences.\nThe biggest difference is who is allowed to participate on the network \u2014 meaning, who is allowed to join the network, to have visibility over the information on the blockchain, to write on it (e.g., launch DApps, execute transactions, etc.) and to participate in its consensus protocol.\nPublic blockchains are open for anyone to join and is also why they are often referred to as permissionless blockchains. As such, public blockchains are more decentralized and no one entity has absolute control over the governance of the network. Most cryptocurrency platforms run on a public blockchain, and well-known examples include Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).\nThe disadvantages of public blockchains are the fact that they can take an enormous amount of computational power to reach consensus on the network, especially proof-of-work (POW) blockchains, and there is little or zero privacy for transactions.\nPrivate blockchains require an application or invitation to join the network. Acceptance to the network would normally depend on a set of rules established by the originator of the network. As such, private blockchains are also referred to as permissioned blockchains.\nThis process of permission puts a restriction on who is allowed to join the network and in what capacity they are allowed to participate.\nThe permission process will also vary from network to network. A regulator within the network could issue licenses for participation, it could be in the form of a consortium that makes the decision, or the current network participants could come to an agreement on future participants.\nEnterprise blockchains are less anonymous, which helps with compliance such as Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, and transaction visibility is contained within the network, which provides a level of privacy and security. It is also cheaper, as the network wouldn\u2019t require the vast amounts of processing power of public blockchains and nodes don\u2019t necessarily have to be paid to verify transactions. Consensus tends to be faster, as there are far fewer nodes on a network that has to come to a majority consensus, which also provides for better scalability. These are important factors for large corporations.\nExamples of enterprise blockchain networks include R3 Corda, Hashgraph, Everledger, Hyperledger and Quorum (from JPMorgan Chase). Other corporations that have tested and invested in private blockchain networks include Goldman Sachs, Santander and Royal Bank of Canada (RBC).\nThe number one drawback to private blockchains is that they tend to be more centralized, as there are often significantly fewer network participants than on public blockchains. This increases the risk of manipulation by a small group, or even a single malicious actor.\nAs a result, a number of criticisms have been levied against private blockchains.\n\nNot everyone is a fan of enterprise blockchains\nAn article published by international consulting firm McKinsey & Company in January 2019 took a very cynical view on blockchain\u2019s influence, stating that the technology has yet to become the game-changer some expected, and the bottom line is that, despite billions of dollars of investment \u2014 and nearly as many headlines \u2014 evidence for a practical, scalable use for blockchain is thin on the ground.\nJimmy Song, a Bitcoin developer and venture partner Blockchain Capital, said in an interview that private, centralized systems, such as an enterprise blockchains, \u201cmakes zero sense,\u201d while Bill Barhydt, CEO of cryptocurrency wallet and investing app Abra, called enterprise blockchains \u201cnonsense\u201d during an episode of Fortune\u2019s \u201cBalancing The Ledger\u201d:", "birthday": "2019-03-14T16:09:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-14 16:09:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 14}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/thirsty-california-may-be-wary-of-blockchain-water-rights", "title": " Thirsty California May Be Wary of Blockchain Water Rights ", "content": "Last week, Colorado lawmakers filed a bill exploring how blockchain technology could be applied to water rights management.\nNow, California is also studying blockchain for use in water rights management, as reported by Cointelegraph. But coming off a severe drought, which saw water restrictions throughout the state, they are facing a far different set of circumstances than Colorado, as water rights in California have always been a highly political issue.\nThe film \u201cWater & Power: A California Heist\u201d examined how a handful of corporate landowners took advantage of a state-engineered system and gained control of its water, leaving local homeowners with dry wells. Hollywood also has examined the issue with a bit more drama in \u201cChinatown,\u201d where the California\u2019s water wars and dirty dealing was dealt with by Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway.\nIn a state where agricultural and corporate interests consume much of the available water while restaurants won\u2019t serve a glass for free and residents\u2019 lawns turn brown, blockchain adoption may be looked at warily by special interests and government, all with a vested interest in maintaining a veil over water usage while blaming the little guys for waste. \u00a0\nHere\u2019s a closer look at how the blockchain might be implemented in California to manage water.\nIBM, The Freshwater Trust and SweetSense\nIn California, researcher the Pacific Institute has a nonprofit called The Freshwater Trust. It has already spearheaded a collaboration on water management with IBM and SweetSense. The project amounts to a blockchain-based system that implements Internet of Things (IoT) sensors across water pumps in a major river.\nThe state has been plagued by severe water shortages since 2006, and suffered drought in nine of these past thirteen years. That\u2019s actually keeping within historical norms, as in the 20th century, the state had five periods of drought, with one lasting nine years and another eight years.\nCalifornia receives most of its water from systems called atmospheric rivers. These storms drop most of the water the region receives on a yearly basis. On average, between 30 and 50 percent of annual precipitation in West Coast states happens in about three atmospheric rivers.\nWhen too few happen, California is in a drought.\nScientists and engineers will use blockchain and IoT sensors to track groundwater usage in real-time across the Sacramento San Joaquin River Delta. Their aim is to manage the water supply and ease pressures on the water table.\nCovering 1,100 square miles, the northern California delta is one of the largest aquifers considered by many to be at a high risk for ecological destruction. It sources water for the southern and coastal areas of the state and supports dozens of endangered species, including around 75 percent of all salmon found in California. Three quarters of the delta is further used for agriculture, and this is responsible for much of the high water demand.\n\u201cCalifornia is huge for American agriculture, but it\u2019s heavily groundwater dependent,\u201d said Alex Johnson, fund director for The Freshwater Trust, while speaking to Digital Trends. \u201cThere are some basins in the central valley that have been so depleted over the last couple decades that they are 20 feet lower in elevation.\u201d\nAquifers in California have suffered from intensive farming and business use. The water table is not just being lowered, making water more scarce, but rain has not replenished the aquifers fast enough. One, or even two, rainy years are not enough; the ground is already sinking in a phenomenon called subsidence, the sudden sinking or gradual downward settling of the ground's surface with little or no horizontal motion.\nA market for water\nIoT sensors track levels of groundwater pulled up from individual pumps before uploading data via satellite to IBM\u2019s blockchain \u2014 with no need for internet connectivity \u2014 and then water credits can be granted according to usage. A credit grants its owner the right to extract a set amount of groundwater, but if their need is less, they can sell it as a digital asset.\nConversely, those in need of additional water credits are able to buy from others. This is great if, for example, a farmer chooses to rest their land for a season at the same time a winery realizes it needs extra groundwater during a particularly dry spell. A blockchain system coupled with AI could theoretically recognize opportunities for businesses to trade credits for water and notify administrators and businesses. There is no direct negative effect on the aquifer, if the additional water shares can be bought from the farmer.\nSuch an open market gives an incentive for businesses and farmers to manage their water use due to the fact that using less means they can sell their credits for a profit. Managing the water supply in this way could prove efficient in a region where already too much groundwater has been drawn.\nUsing blockchain brings transparency to the system because all records and subsequent amendments can be seen by anyone. Being able to observe the amount of groundwater used by various entities is vital: There is no incentive for an individual to regulate water usage if competitors pay no heed to regulations. If the pilot project is successful, blockchain will be set to play an instrumental role in helping prevent a state-wide ecological disaster looming large for California.\nSo, how can blockchain help more efficiently manage these artificial rivers and the water they bring? \u00a0\nBeyond water rights database management, water markets and general administration, a blockchain system could make the management of water more efficient while interfacing with automation and AI. For instance, after numerous recent artificial rivers, less than 1 percent of the state is still considered in drought (one year ago, the United States Drought Monitor classified 48 percent of California as being in a drought). Surprisingly, this region is on the Oregon border.\nUsing trustworthy oracles, an AI-blockchain could theoretically identify changes in conditions ahead of time, suggest contingency plans, and find buyers (in the drought-stricken region) and sellers (in the regions with ample rainfall) for water before the atmospheric storms even arrive. A blockchain logistics system could be implemented as part of a blockchain-based water management system.\nThe Hyperledger blockchain", "birthday": "2019-03-12T18:21:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-12 18:21:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 12}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralization-first-privacy-coin-monero-cuts-out-asic-miners-to-stay-independent", "title": " Decentralization First: Privacy Coin Monero Cuts Out ASIC Miners to Stay Independent ", "content": "On March 9, Monero (XMR) network was successfully upgraded via a hard fork. The new code curbed application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)-powered mining with a new proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm. Additionally, new dynamic block size algorithm and improved privacy \u2014 which is considered to be Monero\u2019s key feature \u2014 were introduced.\nOnce the ASIC miners were taken out of the equation, the network\u2019s hash rate dropped over 80 percent \u2014 which, however, might be positive for the cryptocurrency in the long term.\nAnonymity above all: Monero\u2019s main principle\nMonero is a privacy coin, meaning that it is anonymous and untraceable by design. It was originally created in April 2014 under the name of BitMonero. Eventually, BitMonero was forked and became an open-source project dubbed \u201cMonero\u201d (which means \u201ccoin\u201d in Esperanto).\nMonero is based on the CryptoNight proof-of-work (PoW) hash algorithm, which entails three key features: ring signatures, which are used to mix the spender's address with a group of others, making it more difficult to trace transactions; stealth addresses, which are generated for each transaction and make it allegedly impossible to track its actual destination by anyone else other than the two parties involved in it; and ring confidential transactions, which are used to conceal the transferred amount.\nXMR\u2019s focus on privacy helped it to stand out from more conventional cryptocurrencies and become a relatively popular means of payment within the underground economy, namely on darknet markets like Alphabay and Oasis. In 2016, partly due to being integrated on those trading platforms, XMR experienced more growth in market capitalization and transaction volume than any other cryptocurrency, skyrocketing almost by 2,800 percent, as per CoinMarketCap. Currently, XMR is the 13th-biggest coin by market cap, with equivalent of over $845 million.\n\nMonero\u2019s alleged privacy has attracted a lot of controversy. For instance, as previously reported by Cointelegraph, Monero has been endorsed by white supremacists like Christopher Cantwell specifically for its focus on anonymity.\nConsequently, it has also drawn pushback from mainstream players such as Japan-based Coincheck, which chose to remove XMR and three other anonymity-focused altcoins due to Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures imposed by the local financial regulator. More recently, the Finance Committee of France\u2019s National Assembly suggested a ban on anonymous cryptocurrencies, including Monero.\nNotably, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has claimed that, although privacy coins are less liquid and more anonymous than BTC, the agency \u201cstill has ways of tracking\u201d altcoins, including Monero specifically.\nNew update: ASIC resistance at all costs\nThe upgrade v 0.14.0, dubbed \u201cBoron Butterfly,\u201d was activated at block height 1,788,000 on March 9, as per the previously released schedule. Given that it was a noncontentious fork, no chain split occurred. Monero\u2019s hard forks are normally planned every six months in order to ensure sustainability.\nAccording to the log, Monero\u2019s privacy was enhanced via payment ID changes, and a new dynamic block size algorithm was introduced to prevent blockchain bloating attacks.\nMore importantly, the upgrade introduced a new PoW algorithm, CryptoNightR, also known as Cryptonight variant 4 (CNv4). Specifically, this algorithm introduced ASIC-resistance in a bid to keep the network decentralized. Monero has been pushing out ASIC-powered mining from the XMR network since its birth, but the code has to be updated regularly to ensure that.\nThe Monero developer known as Binaryfate confirmed to Cointelegraph that the new algorithm is designed to render useless any existing ASIC that would have been mining XMR before the fork, as well as reduce the efficiency gap with graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs) if new ASICs were designed for the new algorithm:\n\u201cThe point of making Monero ASIC-resistant is to ensure sufficient decentralization of the network, since ASICs are far from being commoditized. As one of the goals of the project is to be a fungible currency, it is also important to be censorship resistant (for instance so nobody can try to enforce or be pressured to enforce only a subset of whitelisted transactions to be mined).\u201d\n\u201cThe CryptoNightR algorithm is essentially another tweak that aims to reduce the efficiency gap for ASICs. One of its features is including random code generation, which presumably makes it more difficult for ASIC manufacturers to design and build a device,\u201d an active Monero community member told Cointelegraph via direct messages on Reddit.\n\u201cASIC resistance is currently the philosophy of the community.\u201d\nIndeed, as Mark D\u2019Aria, founder and CEO of Bitpro, a New York-based installation and mining operation management firm, told Cointelegraph, ASIC-powered rigs are not necessarily welcome by developers because of their profit-driven nature, especially when it comes to cryptocurrencies with smaller market caps:\n\u201cBecause ASICs are specialized hardware used to compete in a zero sum game for block rewards, manufacturers are incentivized to keep their development secret to protect their competitive edge. Unlike GPUs which are general purpose hardware, ASICs are basically money printing machines, and nothing more. For an ASIC manufacturer their goal is obviously to make the most money possible \u2014 and in most cases, particularly for smaller market cap coins, there's no way to justify selling the device for less money than they project that it can print.\u201d\nSince the Boron Butterfly hard fork has been activated, Monero network\u2019s hash rate initially dropped over a whopping 80 percent \u2014 which seems to indicate that the network was once again largely controlled by ASIC-powered rigs despite Monero\u2019s previous efforts, as mining operations eventually get updated to comply with new algorithms.\n\nBinaryfate argues that the drop is not harmful for the network, adding that the hash rate always takes a day or two to adjust, and already looks \u201cpretty stable\u201d at this point:", "birthday": "2019-03-13T17:35:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-13 17:35:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 13}

This shows that the sector is generating huge interest from traditional players. It is only a matter of time before the price of cryptocurrencies starts to react to all these positive fundamental developments.\nHowever, analysts at Bloomberg expect Bitcoin to head southward. They have observed that the price action is similar to November of last year, which had led to a sharp fall. But what do our charts forecast? Let\u2019s find out.\nBTC/USD\nThe bulls are providing support to Bitcoin (BTC) at the 20-day EMA. Both the moving averages are gradually moving up and the RSI is in the positive zone. This shows that bulls have a slight advantage. However, in order to solidify their position, they should quickly carry the digital currency above $4,000.\nWe expect a new uptrend on a breakout and close above $4,255, as it will complete a double bottom pattern that has a target objective of $5,273.91. Traders can add to their long positions on a close (UTC time frame) above $4,255.\n\nOn the downside, the BTC/USD pair has support at the 20-day EMA. If this breaks, the next support is at the uptrend line and finally at the 50-day SMA. If the pair plummets below the 50-day SMA, it can drop to the final support zone of $3,355\u2013$3,236.09. This is the last support, below which, the downtrend will resume. Therefore, traders can maintain their stops on the existing long positions below $3,236.09. We shall raise the stop loss before the end of this week.\nETH/USD\nThe bulls are struggling to keep Ethereum (ETH) above $134.50. Though they purchased the dip to the 50-day SMA on March 12, they have not been able to sustain above the 20-day EMA. Currently, both the moving averages are flattening out and the RSI is close to the midpoint. This suggests a consolidation in the near term.\n\nA breakdown of the 50-day SMA can sink the ETH/USD pair to the next support at $116.30. This is a major support, as the uptrend line of the ascending channel also lies at this level. Hence, we anticipate buyers to step in and buy close to $116.30. But if the pair breaks down of this critical support, a drop to $102.49 is probable.\nConversely, if the bulls scale above $144.78, the up move can reach $167.32. The ascending triangle pattern will complete on a breakout and close above $167.32. This has a pattern target of $251.64. Traders can keep the stops on the remaining long positions at $125.\nXRP/USD\nThe intraday range in Ripple (XRP) had been shrinking for the past few days. The attempt by the bulls to resolve the tight range on the upside is not finding buyers at higher levels. This is a bearish sign. A breakdown of the uptrend line can sink the virtual currency to the next support at $0.27795. If this level also breaks down, the final support is the yearly low of $0.24508, below which the downtrend will resume.\n\nHowever, as long as the XRP/USD pair stays above the uptrend line of the ascending triangle, the bulls are likely to attempt to scale above $0.33108 once again. On a close (UTC time frame) above $0.33108, the pair is likely to pick up momentum and rally to the downtrend line of the descending channel. A breakout of the channel will indicate a likely change in trend. For now, traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions below $0.27795.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) found support close to the 20-day EMA on March 12, but the bulls have not been able to breakout of the overhead resistance at $56.910. However, both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in positive territory, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. A breakout and close (UTC time frame) above the overhead resistance zone of $56.910\u2013$59.4494 can propel the digital currency to $65.5610 and above it to $69.2790.\n\nContrary to our assumption, if the LTC/USD pair breaks down of the 20-day EMA, it will weaken the momentum and a fall to $47.2460 is probable. Therefore, traders can protect their gains on the remaining long positions with the stop at $50. The only thing bearish on the chart is the negative divergence on the RSI.\nEOS/USD\nEOS has failed to cross above the downtrend line for the past four days. However, a positive is that it has not yet broken down of the 20-day EMA. If the digital currency breaks out of the downtrend line and $3.8723, it can pick up momentum and rally to $4.4930.\n\nOn the other hand, if the bears sink the EOS/USD pair below the 20-day EMA, it can fall to the next support at $3.1534. The 50-day SMA is also located at this level, hence, we expect strong demand at this level. But if the seller\u2019s break down of this critical support, it will re-enter the range and can slide to $2.1733. Hence, traders can protect their remaining long positions with the stops at $3.10.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) had dipped closer to the bottom of the $120\u2013$140 range on March 12, where buying emerged. However, the bulls have not been able to push the price above the moving averages, which shows a lack of demand at higher levels. The bears are likely to attempt to breakdown of $120 level once again. If successful the digital currency can fall to $105, which is a strong support. But if this support gives way, a retest of the yearly low of $73.50 is probable.\n\nConversely, if the BCH/USD pair rises above the moving averages, the bulls will attempt to breakout of $140 and rally to the next overhead zone of $157.95\u2013$163.89. Above this zone, the next level to watch on the upside is $175. For now, traders can retain the stops on the long positions at $116.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) broke out of the pennant on March 12 but is currently facing resistance at $15.9100517. Both the moving averages continue to trend up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, which shows a strong uptrend.\n\nA breakout of $15.9100517 can propel the BNB/USD pair to $18, above which a retest of the lifetime highs is possible. On the other hand, if the pair turns down from current levels, it has support closer to $14, below which a drop to the 20-day EMA is possible. As the traders have already booked partial profits earlier, we suggest to retain the stops on the remaining long positions at the breakeven. If the cryptocurrency does not sustain above $15.9100517 \u00a0within the next couple of days, we shall suggest booking profits on the complete position.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) has been consolidating for the past two days. We like that it has not given up much ground. The 20-day EMA is sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought levels. This suggests that the bulls are at an advantage. A breakout of $0.11245806 can propel the digital currency to $0.13427050.\n\nConversely, if the XLM/USD pair turns down from current levels, it can drop to the 20-day EMA, which is a critical support. If this support breaks, the pair can correct to the uptrend line. This line has provided support three times, hence, we expect the price to find buyers close to it. However, if the bears break down of the uptrend line, a retest of the yearly lows is possible. Therefore, traders can maintain the stops on the long positions at $0.08.\nTRX/USD\nTron (TRX) has been sustaining below $0.02306493 for the past two days. This shows a lack of demand at lower levels. The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is languishing in the negative zone, which suggests that the path of least resistance is to the downside.\n", "birthday": "2019-03-13T19:34:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-13 19:34:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 13}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao recently tweeted that sooner or later, almost everyone will be directly or indirectly connected to cryptocurrencies. This is a strong statement. If proven correct, the market capitalization of the digital currencies will shoot up, well above the current level of $133 billion.\nZhao said that he is certain of a bull market in cryptocurrencies, but is not sure when it will start. We believe that most major coins have started the bottoming process and will soon start a new uptrend.\nThe successful completion of a recent ICO by the crypto unit of South Korea\u2019s largest internet conglomerate Kakao Corp shows that the demand for ICOs is gradually returning. Similarly, Binance had also completed a couple of ICOs in record time and is planning to introduce more tokens that have solid use cases.\nInvestment management company Invesco has launched a blockchain exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the London Stock Exchange (LSEG) that will track 48 companies involved with blockchain technology.\nAfter launching the world\u2019s first multi-crypto-based exchange-traded product (ETP) in November of last year, Switzerland\u2019s largest stock exchange SIX will launch another ETP for the XRP token.

Let\u2019s take a look at the charts.\nYou can also check out professional analysis of cryptocurrency markets on Cointelegraph\u2019s Youtube channel. This week, crypto broker Patrick Heusser discusses Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin performance.\nBTC/USD\nThe up move in Bitcoin (BTC) is not convincing. It could not even challenge the psychological resistance of $4,000 on March 9. This shows a lack of conviction among the bulls. Currently, the price has pulled back to the 20-day EMA, which is an important support. If the bulls want to retain the advantage, they should defend the 20-day EMA. A bounce from this support will again try to break out of $4,000 and reach the critical overhead resistance of $4,255.\n\nIf the BTC/USD pair sustains above $4,255, it will complete a double bottom pattern, that has a target objective of $5,273.91. Traders can add long positions on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $4,255. Until then, maintain the stops on the existing long positions below $3,236.09. \u00a0\nOn the downside, there is support at the 20-day EMA and below it at the uptrend line. If this support also cracks, the next one is at the 50-day SMA. Below this support, we anticipate a quick slide to the final support zone of $3,355\u2013$3,236.09. The lackluster price action points to range bound action in the short-term. We will know the boundaries of the range within the next few days.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) has broken down of the 20-day EMA. If it fails to find support at $134.50, a slide to the 50-day SMA is probable. Below this, the digital currency can correct to the critical support at $116.30. Therefore, traders can keep the stop loss on the remaining long positions at $125.\n\nIf the ETH/USD pair bounces off $134.50 or the 50-day SMA, it will again try to break out of $144.78. The pair is likely to pick up momentum after the price sustains above $144.78.\nHowever, with both the moving averages flattening out and the RSI close to the center, the short term points to a consolidation. The resistance of the probable range is at $144.78 but the support is yet to be established. We should get a clear picture within this week.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) is range bound between $0.27795\u2013 $0.33108. The flat moving averages and the RSI close to 50 suggest that the consolidation is likely to continue for a few more days.\n\nA breakout of the range will propel the XRP/USD pair toward the resistance line of the descending channel. If the price sustains above the channel, it will indicate a likely change in trend.\nHowever, if the bears sink the digital currency below $0.27795, it can drop to the yearly low of $0.24508. Therefore, traders can retain the stops on their long positions below $0.27795.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) again broke out of $56.910 on March 9, but the bulls could not build up on the gains. Once again, the price has corrected back below $56.910, which is a negative sign.\n\nThe bears will try to sink the LTC/USD pair to the 20-day EMA, which is a critical support. If the pair bounces off this support, it will again try to break out of $60. The target to watch on the upside is $65.5610. The uptrending moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory show that the path of least resistance is to the upside.\nHowever, the negative divergence developing on the RSI is worrying us. Hence, we suggest traders keep their stops on the remaining long positions at $50. If the bears force the digital currency below the 20-day EMA, it can slide to $47.2460 and below it to the 50-day SMA.\nEOS/USD\nEOS has turned down from the overhead resistance of $3.8723. The failure of the bulls to scale above $3.8723 is a negative sign. Currently, the price has corrected to the 20-day EMA. If the support holds, the bulls will attempt to push the digital currency above $3.8723 once again.\n\nNonetheless, if the 20-day EMA breaks down, the EOS/USD pair can drop to the next support of $3.1534. The 50-day SMA is also close to this level, hence, we expect the bulls to defend it.\nA failure to bounce off the support at the 50-day SMA can result in a fall to $2.1733. Therefore, traders can keep the stops on the remaining long positions at $3.10.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) continues to trade inside the tight range of $120\u2013$140. This shows a balance between demand and supply. The flat moving averages and the RSI close to the center point to further consolidation.\n\nA breakout or breakdown of this range will start a new trend in the BCH/USD pair. Above $140, a rally to the next overhead zone of $157.95 to $163.89 is likely. If this zone is also crossed, the up move can extend to $175. Therefore, traders can maintain the stops on the long positions at $116. If the bears sink the pair below $120, it can decline to $105 and below that a fall to the yearly low of $73.50 is probable.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) has been consolidating since breaking out of $15 on March 7. We had suggested to book profits on 40 percent of the long positions in our previous analysis. Traders got that opportunity on March 8 and 9 when price scaled well above $15.\n\nAfter the sharp rally from the bottom, the BNB/USD pair has formed a pennant. A breakout of this is likely to resume the uptrend, with targets of $18 and higher. Therefore, traders can hold the remaining long positions with the stop loss at breakeven.\nA breakdown below the pennant will start a deeper correction. Though the pattern target of the breakdown is $9, we anticipate a strong support at the 20-day EMA. But if this level fails to hold, a fall to the 50-day SMA is probable.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) triggered our buy recommended given in the previous analysis. It should now move up to the next overhead resistance of $0.13427050.\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bullish crossover, which is a bullish sign. The 20-day EMA has started to trend up and the RSI has risen close to the overbought territory. This shows that the bulls have the advantage in the near term. The XLM/USD pair might face some resistance at $0.1160, but we expect this to be crossed.\nOur bullish view will be negated if the price turns down from one of the overhead resistances and plummets below $0.0820. Therefore, traders can keep the stop loss at $0.08. We shall soon raise the stops as the price moves northwards.\nTRX/USD\nTron (TRX) is struggling to bounce off the critical support at $0.02306493. This shows a lack of buyers even at these levels. The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is languishing in the negative zone, which suggests that bears are in command.\n", "birthday": "2019-03-11T19:05:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-11 19:05:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 11}
{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/tipping-point-kroger-starbucks-may-ignite-retail-crypto", "title": " The Tipping Point: Kroger, Starbucks May Ignite Retail Crypto ", "content": "It's no secret that cryptocurrencies don't receive many plaudits in the mainstream media as reliable means of payment. Critics have even claimed that Bitcoin \"sucks\" as a payment mechanism.\nYet, despite that blinkered skepticism, cryptocurrency payments actually grew last year. Payment processor BitPay\u00a0reported a \"record\" $1 billion in transaction revenue in 2018, with its business-to-business (B2B) operations increasing by 255 percent compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, the use of cryptocurrencies in such economically unstable countries as Venezuela and India has\u00a0surged, as people turn to the likes of Bitcoin and Dash to escape from increasingly worthless national currencies.\nThese are all encouraging developments, and they've become more encouraging in recent months, with growing interest in crypto payments from major retailers. From Kroger to Starbucks and Rakuten, big corporate names have begun flirting with Bitcoin and the Lightning Network as a payment channel, as well as with other cryptocurrencies. Their interest comes amid rising disenchantment with legacy payment systems, stoking hopes that a few more big converts to crypto payments could provide an all-important tipping point toward widespread adoption.\nHowever, while events appear to be moving in the right direction for crypto payments, experts agree that it will take more than a few isolated use cases before the industry will see adoption on a larger scale. Added to this, payment interfaces need to be improved and made more consumer-friendly. It's only with the combination of technological effectiveness and corporate adoption that the global public will begin using crypto as money.\nKroger struck by lightning?\nAt the beginning of March, supermarkets giant Kroger \u2014 the\u00a017th-largest company in the United States \u2014 revealed that it would stop accepting Visa credit cards at over 250 of its stores. \"Visa has been misusing its position and charging retailers excessive fees for a long time,\" said Kroger executive VP Mike Schlotman in a statement, with the retailing giant also explaining that Visa\u2019s fees were the highest of any of the credit cards it accepted.\nWhat's interesting about this episode is that members of the crypto community quickly swooped in to make the case for Kroger to accept Lightning Network payments. On Twitter, Morgan Creek Digital founder Anthony \u201cPomp\u201d Pompliano\u00a0reached out on March 2 to the retailer's leadership team, stating that the \"Morgan Creek Digital team will fly to meet them and get them hooked up with the Lightning Network nationwide.\" Even more interesting, Pomp followed this up on March 3 with a\u00a0tweet announcing that he had just \"finished up first call with someone on Kroger Digital team,\" and that his followers should \"stay tuned\" for more updates.\nIt's hard to say just how far Kroger will run with Pompliano's offer, yet industry figures are more or less unanimous in their views that adoption of Bitcoin payments by a giant like Kroger would be a watershed moment for the industry.\n\"Adoption of Lightning Network by a major retailer would definitely be a big deal for the entire crypto space,\" says Vilius Semenas, the chief commercial officer at crypto-payment processor CoinGate. \"For bitcoin, exposure to real consumers on such a scale could only do good and pave the way toward another level of adoption.\"\nAccording to Semenas, there's certainly an appetite among major retailers for a new payment network to replace legacy systems. \"The card payments industry is unique in that Visa and MasterCard control the lion\u2019s share of the consumer base,\" he told Cointelegraph. \"At the same time, innovation adoption in this space takes a long time because the market is two-sided and needs adoption from both consumers and retailers. Retailers are naturally frustrated, because they have little-to-no ability to affect card payments, and they would probably turn to alternative payment rails if they could.\"\nCoinGate isn't the only crypto-payment processor who suspects that such retailers as Kroger would prefer to move to more efficient and cost-effective payment systems. BitPay's director of product, Sean Rolland, also told Cointelegraph much the same thing, even if he suspects that it will be a long time before existing systems are replaced by crypto-based alternatives. \"No business enjoys high fees,\" he said. \"Legacy payment systems are not going completely away anytime soon, but retailers should always be evaluating better solutions.\"\nStarbucks, Rakuten, Birks Group dip their toes\nAside from Kroger, there are signs that other big players are entertaining the idea of moving to the Lightning Network and crypto payments. Most notably, Starbucks will begin accepting Bitcoin payments at its U.S. outlets by the end of 2019,\u00a0according to industry rumors. This acceptance comes as part of an equity deal with Bakkt, a cryptocurrency exchange and payments platform being launched later this year by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the operator of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\nBack in August, the coffee giant was\u00a0revealed as one of Bakkt's key partners, alongside Microsoft and consultancy BCG. According to the\u00a0press release announcing Bakkt and its partnerships, Starbucks would not only be working with Bakkt to create its platform, but it would also be using the platform to accept crypto payments. In other words, even though the latest reports regarding Starbucks' imminent acceptance of Bitcoin payments are unconfirmed, the company itself had already confirmed that it will be doing this sooner or later, as explained in August by its VP of partnerships and payments, Maria Smith.\n\"As the flagship retailer, Starbucks will play a pivotal role in developing practical, trusted and regulated applications for consumers to convert their digital assets into US dollars for use at Starbucks,\" Smith said on the occasion of Bakkt's announcement. \u201cAs a leader in Mobile Pay to our more than 15 million Starbucks Rewards members, Starbucks is committed to innovation for expanding payment options for our customers.\"\n\nThis is precisely the arrangement that's now rumored to be launching toward the end of the year. Reports indicate Starbucks will accept Bitcoin payments at its American outlets, but it will immediately convert these to fiat, as indicated by its initial press release from August. So even though the exact launch date hasn't been confirmed, this will prove a massive boost to Bitcoin and crypto payments, and it's hard to imagine that other big companies won't follow Starbucks' lead.\nRight now, there are no firm signs that other retailers as big as Starbucks or Kroger will begin accepting crypto payments anytime soon. However, there are a steady supply of slightly less high-profile companies (less high-profile in the U.S., at least) that have begun accepting such payments, or which will do so soon.\nIn November, Birks Group \u2014 one of Canada's largest and oldest jewellery retailers \u2014 announced that it had begun accepting Bitcoin at eight of its 30 stores in Canada. And in January and February, it became increasingly likely that Rakuten \u2014 Japan's largest e-commerce website \u2014 would begin accepting crypto, after it\u00a0established a new payments subsidiary and announced an\u00a0update to its Rakuten Pay app that would feature support for cryptocurrency payments.\nYou can still count such companies on one or two hands. However, given their size and clout, their movements into crypto payments are likely to put greater pressure on their rivals to act similarly. As BitPay\u2019s Rolland affirms, \"The more retailers that accept bitcoin, the better.\"\n", "birthday": "2019-03-11T17:22:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-11 17:22:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 11}

Since then, it has been delisted from Nasdaq, hit with a subpoena by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), made (and then cancelled) mining-related plans, and limited its blockchain endeavors to one minor investment.\nBackground: fairly successful iced tea company capable of securing a Nasdaq spot\nLong Island Iced Tea Corp was founded in Hicksville, New York in July 2011 as a non-alcoholic iced tea company \u201cthat leverages an iconic name to meet shifting consumer demands in the ready-to-drink tea (RTD Tea) segment.\u201d\nAccording to its LinkedIn page, the firm has achieved solid distribution growth in the Northeast region of the United States \u201cwith plans for aggressive expansion nationwide.\u201d In July 2016, Long Island Iced Tea Corp\u2019s shares began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (one of three tiers of the Nasdaq Stock Market related specifically to small-capitalization companies) under the ticker LTEA, as the tea maker had raised $6.9 million in a stock offering. Prior to that, the company\u2019s stock had been trading over-the-counter (OTC).\nDespite getting listed on Nasdaq, the soft drinks company was off to a rough start. First, according to Newsday, its earlier filings with the SEC showed that Long Island Iced Tea Corp. planned to collect more than $10 million from the stock offering, while it had only received $6.9 million. Further, LTEA shares reportedly fell 13 percent to close at $5.95 on the first trading day. The company\u2019s CEO, Philip Thomas, explained that the decline in stock price had been expected, as LTEA shares were being sold for $5.50 on OTC markets.\n\u201cYou can expect that would put some downward pressure on it,\u201d he told Newsday at the time.\nFurther, in October 2017, Long Island Iced Tea Corp. received its first delisting warning from Nasdaq, as per the firm\u2019s report submitted to the SEC. Nasdaq\u2019s complaint was that the tea maker\u2019s market value stayed below $35 million for 30 straight working days, violating Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b). The stock exchange had given the company until April 2018 to fix the situation.\nBlockchain frenzy: skyrocketing stocks and the power of hype\nIn December 2017, the company found a solution that would allow it to remain Nasdaq-listed. After capitalizing on the ongoing crypto euphoria and rebranding itself as Long Blockchain Corp., the company saw its shares skyrocket by 289 percent. As Techcrunch noted, as of Dec. 20, the firm had a market value of just $23.8 million \u2014 but, at one point in premarket trading, had 9.76 million outstanding shares, giving Long Blockchain Corp. a market value of close to $138 million.\nThus, according to the company\u2019s new plan, it was going to continue selling nonalcoholic beverages through a subsidiary called Long Island Brand Beverages, LLC, but also work toward \"the exploration of and investment in opportunities that leverage the benefits of blockchain technology.\"\nThe move wasn\u2019t particularly innovative, and the firm was not the only one seeing its shares soar due to blockchain-oriented rebranding. As the Guardian pointed out at the time, Long Island Iced Tea was \u201cnot even the first soft drinks company to also do so,\u201d adding that \u00a0a firm formerly known as SkyPeople Fruit Juice jumped by more than 200 percent after changing its name to Future FinTech and making pro-Bitcoin (BTC) statements. Other companies achieved similar results as early as in October 2017, when, for instance, a British investment firm, On-line Plc, added the word \u201cblockchain\u201d to its name and saw a 394 percent increase of its shares.\n\nIn January 2018, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton addressed the growing phenomenon of companies adding the word \u201cblockchain\u201d to their names, warning that they could soon face increased scrutiny from regulators:\n\u201cI doubt anyone in this audience thinks it would be acceptable for a public company with no meaningful track record in pursuing the commercialization of distributed ledger or blockchain technology to (1) start to dabble in blockchain activities, (2) change its name to something like \"Blockchain-R-Us,\" and (3) immediately offer securities, without providing adequate disclosure to Main Street investors about those changes and the risks involved.\u201d\nNevertheless, Long Blockchain Corp. CEO Philip Thomas insisted that his company was serious about the technology. He said:\n\u201cWe view advances in blockchain technology as a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and have made the decision to pivot our business strategy in order to pursue opportunities in this evolving industry. [...] We will, in the coming weeks and months, be taking a series of steps related to our efforts to assemble a world-class team of industry professionals to help us realize this vision.\u201d\nLong Blockchain had a lot of blockchain-related plans, but none of them went through\nAccording to reports at the time, as part of its shift in focus, the company was considering a number of investments and acquisitions, including an unspecified software developer who worked with blockchain within financial services industry, a London-based provider of foreign exchange services who was allegedly developing \u201cmultiple blockchain and digital cryptocurrency technology solutions for the financial markets,\u201d and a smart contract platform for creating decentralized applications (DApps). It also asked Nasdaq to change its ticker to LBCC, which the stock exchange operator eventually did.\nOn Jan. 4, 2018, Long Blockchain Corp. revealed its plans to purchase 1,000 Antminer S9 mining rigs for $4,2 million, which were to be shipped to \u201ca secure data centre in the Nordic region to immediately commence mining operations.\u201d\n\u201cWe view this transaction as an important and validating initial step in the company\u2019s progression into blockchain technology,\u201d Thomas said.\n\u201cThe commencement of our mining operations places us on a path to generating blockchain-related revenue through the accumulation of bitcoin.\u201d\nAround the same time, the company announced a public offering of 1,603,294 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $5.25 per share.\nSoon after, on Jan. 16, Long Blockchain Corp. announced its intent to form a wholly owned subsidiary that would merge with a United Kingdom-based tech company Stater Blockchain, which was developing \u201cglobally scalable blockchain technology solutions in the financial markets.\u201d Thomas described the plan as a \u201cpotential milestone.\u201d\nHowever, soon the beverage-firm-turned-blockchain-enterprise\u2019s plans started to tumble. First, on Feb. 2, Long Blockchain Corp. stated it would not buy the mining rigs after all.\n\u201cAfter thoughtful consideration and in consultation with outside technology advisors, the Company will instead focus its efforts on seeking to enter into and ultimately consummate its previously announced proposed merger with Stater Blockchain Limited,\u201d Thomas explained in a press release.\nFurther, the Stater deal fell through as well \u2014 although, to an extent: After nearly two months of negotiations, Long Blockchain Corp. made a minor investment by purchasing a 9.9 percent share of Stater Blockchain, but never fully acquired the U.K. firm.\n\u201cAs the expiration date of the letter of intent approached, both parties agreed that a minority investment with dual board representation would allow us to immediately formalize our partnership while maintaining our respective autonomy,\u201d said Shamyl Malik, who became the new CEO of Long Blockchain after Thomas \u201cterminated his employment agreement\u201d with the company for \u201cgood reason.\u201d\nNasdaq started to question Long Blockchain\u2019s strategy and eventually delisted the company\nBy that time, Long Blockchain Corp.\u2019s market value had fallen below $30 million, and Nasdaq had accused the company of misleading investors. On Feb. 15, the former iced tea maker received a letter from the exchange\u2019s operator, who \u201cbelieved that the company made a series of public statements designed to mislead investors and to take advantage of general investor interest in Bitcoin and blockchain technology, thereby raising concerns about the company\u2019s suitability for exchange listing,\u201d as per the Long Blockchain Corp. filing with the SEC.\nIn the same filing, Long Blockchain Corp. said it \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with Nasdaq\u2019s decision. It has filed an appeal, meaning it could continue trading on the market until a hearing takes place.\nOn March 22, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel ruled against Long Blockchain. Its shares were suspended from the Nasdaq Capital Market starting on April 12. After the delisting, the firm remained a public company with its shares trading publicly, following all required filings and regulations:\n\u201cLBCC will remain a public company following the delisting and its shares will continue to trade publicly. [...] The Company will continue to maintain an independent Board of Directors with an independent Audit Committee and provide annual financial statements audited by a Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) auditor and unaudited interim financial reports, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\u201d\nLong Blockchain might still enter the technology field at last, but the chances are slim\nHence, Long Blockchain Corp. was back on the OTC market. Nevertheless, the company had not given up on its goal of becoming a leader in blockchain. A week prior to being delisted, it announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Hashcove, a U.K.-based technology startup developing blockchain products and applications, in exchange for LBCC common stock. Curiously, Stater Blockchain was supposed to obtain Hashcove in January 2018.\nThen, the once-beverage company underwent yet another rebranding. On Aug. 31, Long Blockchain formed a new subsidiary called Stran Loyalty Group to focus on loyalty, incentive, reward and gift cards for corporate brands.\nIn a statement, Andy Shape \u2014 who now replaced Malik as the new CEO \u2014 confirmed that his company had not, in fact, offered any blockchain-related services to date:\n\u201cAt this time [...] the company has not taken any steps toward developing any such technology and does not employ personnel with the relevant technology expertise.\u201d\nAt the time, the company\u2019s worth was less than $5 million.", "birthday": "2019-03-12T14:16:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-12 14:16:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 12}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nThe CEO of Twitter and Square, Jack Dorsey seems to be buying Bitcoin on a weekly basis. In a recent interview, he said that he had used up the $10,000 weekly limit on Square\u2019s CashApp on buying the leading cryptocurrency. This indicates that Dorsey has been buying Bitcoin around the current price levels.\nChristopher Giancarlo, chairman of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u0421FTC), has said that if blockchain technology was available in 2008, it could have helped the banks manage their data better.\nAccording to Giancarlo, it could have helped the regulators take a more timely and appropriate action to tackle the financial crisis. This implies that the nascent technology could play an important role during the next crisis, if and when it happens.\nIt is no surprise that various industries are exploring options to use blockchain technology to increase productivity. As a result, global blockchain spending in 2019 is expected to reach $2.9 billion, according to advisory services firm International Data Corporation (IDC).\nThe crypto markets have been attempting a recovery over the past few days. Can this continue and precede a new uptrend, or is this another bounce that will be sold into? Let\u2019s look at the charts and analyze.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) has been inching higher for the past three days. While it is positive that the price has been moving up, the speed of the rise is worrying. The current small range action shows a lack of urgency to buy at these levels. At this pace, the bulls will find it difficult to scale above the psychological resistance of $4,000.\n\nShould the BTC/USD pair pick up momentum and move up, forming large trending movements, the probability of a break out of the overhead resistance increases. On breaking out of $4,255, the double bottom formation will complete, which will have a pattern target of $5,273.91. The moving averages have started to turn up, and the RSI is also in the positive territory, which shows that the bulls have a slight edge.\nBut if the pair fails to break out of $4,255, it will extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. The trend will turn negative if the price plunges below $3,355, and the downtrend will resume below $3,236.09.\nFor now, traders can retain the stops on the long positions below $3,236.09. We shall suggest adding more positions if the price sustains above $4,255.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) has been sandwiched between the 20-day EMA and $144.78 for the past two days. Both of the moving averages are flat, and the RSI is also close to the midpoint, which suggests consolidation in the short term.\n\nA break out of $144.78 will indicate strength that can carry the ETH/USD pair to the next overhead resistance of $167.32. If the price sustains above $167.32, it will complete an ascending triangle pattern, which has a target objective of $251.64.\nConversely, if the bears sink the price below 20-day EMA, a fall to 50-day SMA will be probable. If this support also crumbles, the slide can extend to $116.3. Therefore, traders can hold their remaining long positions with a stop loss of $125.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) has been trading close to the moving averages for the past two days. Both of the moving averages are flat, and the RSI is close to the center, which suggests that the range bound action between $0.27795 and $0.33108 is likely to continue for a few more days.\n\nIf the XRP/USD pair slides below $0.29282, it can drop to the bottom of the range at $0.27795. A breakdown from this will retest the low at $0.24508. If the price breaks down to new yearly lows, it will be a huge negative.\nOn the upside, the cryptocurrency will attract buyers if it sustains above $0.33108. We expect momentum above $0.33108 to push the price towards the resistance line of the descending channel. Traders can hold their long positions with stops below $0.27795.\nEOS/USD\nEOS has been struggling to scale above the resistance of $3.8723 for the past three days. However, a small positive is that it has not given up much ground. Both of the moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is in the positive zone, which shows that the bulls have the upper hand.\n\nA fall from the current levels should find support at the 20-day EMA, and below it at $3.1534. The trend will weaken if the bulls fail to defend the 20-day EMA, and it will turn negative on a plunge below $3.1534.\nOn the other hand, if the EOS/USD pair sustains above $3.8723, it can rise to the next overhead resistance of $4.4930. Traders can maintain their stops on the remaining long positions at $3.1.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) broke out of $56.910 on March 7, but could not sustain the higher levels. If the price sustains above $56.910, it can move up to $61.5680, and above it to $65.5610.\nBoth of the moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is also close to the overbought levels, which shows that the path of least resistance is to the upside. The only worrying factor is the negative divergence on the RSI.\n\nIf the LTC/USD pair doesn\u2019t break out of $56.91 within a couple of days, it will be likely to attract profit booking that can drag it to the 20-day EMA. Therefore, traders can trail the stops on the long positions to $50 now, and raise them further if weakness sets in.\nA breakdown of the 20-day EMA will be the first indication that the trend has weakened, and a fall to the 50-day SMA will probably follow.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) failed to reach the top of the $120\u2013$140 range after bouncing off the support on March 4, which shows a lack of buying at higher levels. Currently, the bears are attempting to push the price back to the bottom of the range at $120. The flat moving averages, as well as the RSI close to 50 levels, point to a few more days of consolidation.\n\nA breakdown of $120 can sink the BCH/USD pair to $105, and if this level also breaks, it can fall to $73.5. Conversely, a breakout above $140 can propel the pair to the next overhead zone of $157.95\u2013$163.89. The traders can retain the stops on their long positions at $116.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) scaled above our first target objective of $15 and reached a high of $15.9100517 on March 7. Currently, we see profit booking that has dragged the price back below $15. In a strong uptrend, the pullbacks usually last for one to three days.\nHowever, the failure to sustain above $15 after breaking out of it, shows that the bulls are nervous at higher levels. Therefore, we suggest traders book profits on 40 percent of their long positions on any pullback towards $15 and raise the stops on the rest to breakeven. Let\u2019s avoid losing money if the price turns down sharply from the current levels.\n\nIf the bulls hold the price at $14 and resume the uptrend, a rally to $18 is probable. We anticipate a strong resistance at $18, but if this is crossed, the BNB/USD pair might retest the lifetime highs. This shows that the pair is extremely positive.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the current pullback extends to the 20-day EMA and breaks it. However, we give a low probability of this occurring.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) is attempting to break out of the overhead resistance at $0.09285498. If successful, it will move up to $0.10. If the bulls scale above this level, we anticipate a rally to $0.13427050. Therefore, traders can buy above $0.10 and keep a stop loss at $0.08.\nAs this virtual currency has been an underperformer, we suggest using only 50 percent of the usual position size.\n\nConversely, if the XLM/USD pair turns down either from $0.09285498 or from $0.10, it can fall to $0.08184371. If this support also cracks, the pair will turn negative and can drop to the yearly low.\nBoth of the moving averages are flattening out, and the RSI is close to the midpoint. This suggests that the bears are losing momentum.\nTRX/USD\nTron (TRX) failed to sustain above the 20-day EMA on March 5 and 6, which is a bearish sign. The price is back at the support of $0.02306493. If the bears sink the cryptocurrency below this support, a fall to $0.02094452, and below that to $0.0183 will be probable.\n", "birthday": "2019-03-08T23:51:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-08 23:51:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 8}

Ever since it\u00a0published its investigation into the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in July 2017 and declared that ICO tokens can be (and often are) securities, it has been producing a variety of guidelines and warnings on ICOs for investors.\nInitially, its notices were used to emphasize the potentially fraudulent or dangerous nature of initial coin offerings, with its first-ever Investor Bulletin on ICOs\u00a0concluding with a summary of \"potential warning signs of investment fraud.\" However, even if it followed this up with a number of investor \"alerts,\u201d its current guidelines have taken a more balanced tone, treating ICOs as an established feature of the financial landscape that may nonetheless require a certain degree of diligence on the part of investors.\nAnd on the whole, the industry welcomes this newfound balance, as well as the more measured approach the SEC has taken to crypto. That said, certain industry groups are calling for additional and clearer guidance from the SEC, since there's a feeling that certain grey areas still exist in the commission's classification of cryptocurrencies, with the Blockchain Association speaking of a \"growing sense of urgency\" that such questions be soon resolved.\nCurrent guidelines\nEven though the SEC's updated guidelines have\u00a0reportedly been available since last March, it only recently began promoting them on social media, with tweets from\u00a0February and the\u00a0end of\u00a0November inviting the public to learn five things it needs to know about initial coin offerings.\nFor the most part, these five points don't present any radically new information, even if they might prove useful to ICO newcomers. Nonetheless, their presentation as digestible nuggets of info \u2014 rather than as sections of longer reports or statements \u2014 reveals an appreciation on the SEC's part that cryptocurrencies are being sought out by \u201cregular\u201d consumers, as well as by experienced traders interested in alternative financial instruments. And such a realization is borne out in the basic, easy-to-understand format of the five guidelines, as shown and explained below:\n\"ICOs can be securities offerings.\" This is essentially a warning that cryptos offered in a token sale may fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC, and may therefore need to be registered with the commission.\"They may need to be registered.\" Once again, another warning that some tokens may need to be registered with the SEC.\"Tokens sold in ICOs can be called many things.\" A warning that simply having a different or unusual name won't stop a token from being classified by the SEC as a security.\"ICOs may pose substantial risks.\" A warning that some ICOs may be scams. This point also includes a warning that, even if an ICO isn't fraudulent, sold tokens are at risk of being lost, hacked or having their prices manipulated.\"Ask questions before investing.\" Advice urging consumers to obtain clear answers to any questions or concerns they might have before buying any tokens.\nThe SEC's guidelines also include four additional pointers each for investors and \"market professionals\" (i.e., exchanges, brokers). With regard to the extra investor advice, this expands upon the points made in the five warnings above. For example, investors are encouraged to research how tokens will be traded, to research the individuals and companies offering the tokens, to be aware that tokens may be traded internationally (and may therefore escape the SEC's enforcement), and to be suspicious of offerings that are \"too good to be true.\u201d\nConversely, market professionals (i.e., exchanges) are advised in the additional guidelines specifically for them to uphold securities laws, to register if they sell securities, and to ensure that they protect the interests of investors and their customers. As with the guidelines for investors and the general public, most of the emphasis is placed on the fact that tokens can be \u2014 and frequently are \u2014 securities, given that they often promise future returns (one of the key components of the\u00a0Howey Test).\nAnd while there are still certain issues left to be resolved (see below), this emphasis on the applicability of securities law is welcomed by the Blockchain Association\u2019s Kristin Smith, with the director of external affairs for the Washington D.C.-based lobbying group telling Cointelegraph that the SEC's latest guidelines are a positive step for the industry.\n\"It\u2019s helpful that the SEC has been clear that organizations using tokens to raise funds must comply with securities laws, but the nature of these projects means that there is still a grey area for some tokens. We think that makes a lot of sense that some tokens be treated as securities because it helps close the information gap between investors and creators of a project. It\u2019s a complex environment, so having some clarity on that issue is key.\"\nSoftening up\nDespite containing plenty of warnings about the risks of ICOs, the SEC's latest guidelines appear to represent a tangible step forward in terms of treating crypto as a legitimate area of investment. Back in the first half of 2018, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton was talking about being \"shocked\" by the level of fraud the commission had encountered in the ICO space, while at the same time,\u00a0announcing and applauding efforts by Canadian and American securities officials to crack down on ICO-related scams. He said in April at a conference in Chicago:\n\"The fraudsters flocked to the new and attractive space. I guess that shouldn\u2019t surprise me, but it does.\"\nSuch public remarks gave the impression that the SEC regarded ICOs as a mostly illegitimate vacuum in which opportunists were effectively robbing the gullible. And even though some of Clayton's\u00a0early remarks indicate that the SEC saw genuine potential in token sales, official statements and bulletins from the commission reinforced this impression. In July 2017, for instance, the SEC\u00a0issued an Investor Bulletin,\u00a0which contained many of the same pieces of advices as those given in the latest guidelines, yet the two concluding sections of the statement focused exclusively on fraud.\n\"If fraud or theft results in you or the organization that issued the virtual tokens or coins losing virtual tokens, virtual currency, or fiat currency, you may have limited recovery options. Third-party wallet services, payment processors, and virtual currency exchanges that play important roles in the use of virtual currencies may be located overseas or be operating unlawfully.\"\nSimilarly, in August 2017, it published another\u00a0Investor Alert that not only concentrated on ICO scams, but also apprised would-be investors about the danger that sold tokens would be subject to \"pump-and-dump\" and market manipulation frauds. The alert declared:\n\"The SEC\u2019s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy is warning investors about potential scams involving stock of companies claiming to be related to, or asserting they are engaging in, Initial Coin Offerings (or ICOs). These frauds include \u2018pump-and-dump\u2019 and market manipulation schemes involving publicly traded companies that claim to provide exposure to these new technologies.\"\nOver the course of 2018, the SEC adopted a gradually less stringent and suspicious attitude toward ICOs and crypto, even if the commission\u00a0reported in November that it investigated dozens of token sales in the previous 12 months, and even if it\u00a0closed down a handful of coin offerings. This relative softening is apparent in its latest guidelines, but it's also apparent in some of the recent speeches and pronouncements given by SEC officials, as highlighted by Smith.\n\"In general, the SEC has taken a measured approach as they assess how to regulate crypto tokens. As an industry, we think a couple of recent speeches set the right tone: Director Bill Hinman spoke on the topic of decentralization last June and Commissioner Hester Peirce gave a general assessment of regulatory issues earlier this month.\"\nThe assessment Smith is alluding to here was when Peirce\u00a0stated that the SEC's delay in coming out with clear, decisive regulation should give the crypto industry more leeway to mature according to its own internal dynamics and logic. While Peirce \u2014 or \u201cCrypto Mom,\u201d as she's often referred to \u2014 is one of the more crypto-friendly individuals at the SEC, her comments at least offer indication that there are now people at the commission who view the industry positively, and don't want to restrict or warn against it.\nIt's likely that such a softening of the SEC's sentiment goes hand-in-hand with two things. First of all, having taken a harder line on ICOs towards the end of 2017 and through 2018, the Commission can now feel assured that it has a better handle on coin offerings, and that it can be more moderate and measured in its declarations.\nSecondly, the fact that the ICO and wider crypto markets have settled down over the past few months has also helped to relax the SEC's attitude, even if it still prefers to highlight the risks rather than the benefits of ICOs. This is something that has happened with\u00a0United Kingdom regulators, for example, and it's also something that has been helped by exchanges and token issuers, which have eagerly sought to gain either licensing or exemption status from the SEC.\nFor instance,\u00a0research published by MarketWatch in January found that there had been a 550 percent increase in 2018 in companies seeking authorization from the SEC to hold token sales. If nothing else, this rise has shown the SEC that, even if there are scammers out there, the industry is, on the whole, a very serious one.", "birthday": "2019-03-10T16:38:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-10 16:38:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 10}

Traders should watch for the cryptocurrencies that start a new uptrend and sustain it: it is always better to trade them instead of hoping for the laggards to catch up.\nThe current recovery is backed by improving fundamentals. Fidelity\u2019s new company, Fidelity Digital Assets, surveyed about 450 institutions and found that 22 percent already owned a cryptocurrency and were likely to double their allocation in the next five years. A few, however, were still in the wait-and-watch mode. We believe that if the prices confirm a bottom, these investors will also be forced to jump in. Let\u2019s look at this week\u2019s top performers and try to spot trend reversals. \u00a0\nBNB/USD\nAfter the successful sale of the BitTorrent token (BTT) and Fetch.AI (FET) token, the Binance Launchpad platform has announced the launch of its next supporting project, Celer Network, on Mar. 19 at 9am EST. Binance is attempting to revive initial coin offerings (ICO) \u00a0by supporting high quality tokens with strong use cases that generate interest among the participants.\nArgentina is also bringing cryptocurrencies to the general public. Recently, its state public transport card allowed the use of Bitcoin for card top-ups. Additionally, the government of Argentina will match investments of up to $50,000 on projects selected by Binance. With these developments, Binance Coin has been on a strong run. Can this rally continue further? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe BNB/USD pair has extended its strong run from the bottom. It easily scaled above the overhead resistance of $12 and skyrocketed to the critical resistance zone of $15 to $18. After a large-range week, we anticipate a consolidation or a minor correction in the next couple of weeks.\nNevertheless, if the bulls succeed in breaking out of $18, it will increase the probability of a retest of the lifetime highs. This will be a significant event and the pair will be the first major cryptocurrency to retest the highs.\nConversely, if the price turns down from the current levels, it should find support at $12. A breakdown of $12 will indicate weakness and increase the likelihood of a deeper fall.\nLTC/USD\nVenezuela has allowed its citizens to send Bitcoin and Litecoin (LTC) through Remesas. Market participants are positive on Litecoin because it has lower fees compared to Bitcoin, and also has faster transaction confirmation time. With Litecoin\u2019s next update, some believe that the transaction fees will fall further. Its Lightening Network has seen an increase to 1,059 channels between 163 participants, according to 1ml.com.\n\nThe LTC/USD pair closed (UTC time frame) above $47.2460 last week, triggering our buy recommendation. Traders can keep the stop loss at $40. The next level to watch on the upside is the zone between $69.2790 and the 50-week SMA. If the momentum carries the digital currency above both these levels, the rally can extend to $94.2590 in the medium-term.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the bears push the price back below $56.910 and sustain it. The uptrend will weaken on a close below $47.2460 and the bears will be back in the driver\u2019s seat below the support line.\nFeatured cryptocurrency* \u2014 NEXO/USD\nNexo provides instant loans to clients against their crypto assets. This way, the clients can keep their assets for the long term, but still monetize them for various uses like buying a home, a car, marriage, etc. in the short-to-medium term.\nThe company caters to a wide range of clients, issuing loans from $500 to $2 million per client.\nMany believe that stablecoins are the way to go if one cannot ride the crypto volatility. Nexo offers an interest of up to 6.5 percent on stablecoins and 1-to-1 conversion guarantee to U.S. dollars for each stablecoin.\nNexo also provides a licensed crypto custody solution in partnership with BitGo, allowing it to hold crypto assets on behalf of its customers. In order to ensure the safety of the stored funds, Nexo has an insurance policy in place by Lloyds of London, which compensates any losses of up to $100 million.\nThe coin\u2019s popularity can be gauged from the fact that it has issued more than $300 million in loans in the past 7 months to more than 170,000 Nexo users. It is currently ranked 87 on CoinMarketCap, and Huobi\u2019s listing of the Nexo tokens will greatly increase its liquidity. With the fundamentals in its favor, how does its chart look?\n\nThe NEXO/USD pair formed a rounding bottom pattern and broke out of the overhead resistance at $0.09431 on March 5. However, the bulls could not sustain the higher levels, and the price again slipped back below the breakout levels. This is a negative sign.\nThe rise from the low of $0.05266 on Feb. 6 was well supported by the 20-day EMA during every pullback. Currently, the pair has again dipped to the 20-day EMA, below which the next support is from the uptrend line. We expect the bulls to defend this support zone.\nIf successful, the digital currency will again attempt to scale above the overhead resistance zone of $0.09431 to $0.10717. On a breakout above this zone, a new uptrend is likely to start that can propel the digital currency to $0.12 and above it to $0.13596. If both these levels are crossed, the next levels to watch are $0.168 and finally $0.194.\nOn the other hand, a breakdown of the uptrend line will indicate weakness that can drag the price back to the 50-day SMA.\nEOS/USD\nEOS has been volatile during the week. It started the week by plunging, but recovered the next day. It dropped from fourth to fifth position in terms of market capitalization, losing to Litecoin. Can it reclaim back its position? Is the chart bullish? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nWe had suggested that traders initiate long positions on a weekly close (UTC time frame) above $3.8723 in our earlier analysis. Though the EOS/USD pair rallied above $3.8723 in the previous week, it could not close above it.\nCurrently, the bulls are again attempting to sustain above the overhead resistance. If successful, traders can initiate long positions on a weekly close above $3.8723 and keep a stop loss below the critical support of $2.1733. Though there is a minor resistance at $4.4930, we expect it to be crossed. The next target to watch on the upside is $6.8299. \u00a0\nConversely, if the price fails to sustain above $3.8723 and turns down, it will indicate weakness. A breakdown of $2.1733 will result in a retest of the yearly low.\nXLM/USD\nBorsenmedien AG, a leading publisher in German-speaking regions, has acquired a 5 percent stake in micropayment solutions company SatoshiPay. With the partnership, readers can now pay for content from their wallet to the publisher in just a click.\nStellar (XLM) has been an underperformer in the current pullback. While most major coins are well above their yearly lows, Stellar is struggling to move up. Can it play catch up?\n\nThe XLM/USD pair has been a huge underperformer, as it is still stuck near the lows. It has failed to scale and sustain above the first overhead resistance of $0.09285498 for the past two weeks. Currently, the bulls are again attempting to rise above the resistance. If successful, the pair can move up to $0.13427050.\nBoth the moving averages are turning down and the RSI is still languishing in negative territory, which shows that the bears still have the upper hand. If the digital currency turns down from the current levels, it can plunge to new lows.", "birthday": "2019-03-10T17:39:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-10 17:39:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 10}

According to the research, the increasing mining difficulty for many cryptocurrency means that a higher amount electricity is needed, making it profitable for students to mine since the university pays their electricity costs.\n\u2018Coffee for Bakkt\u2019? Starbucks Equity Deal Will See Crypto-Based Payments, Source Claims\nAn unconfirmed report about Starbucks\u2019 partnership with United States digital asset platform Bakkt this week has revealed that the coffee giant will allegedly accept Bitcoin-based payments after an equity deal. Starbucks had become a founding partners in Bakkt when it was revealed in August 2018, but had shut down rumors that it would be accepting BTC for coffees. Now, an unnamed source has said that the chain will accept Bitcoin through Bakkt\u2019s software, but it will instantly convert the crypto into fiat, so that Starbucks will never actually hold any cryptocurrency.\n\nCrypto Lending Company BlockFi Launches Crypto Accounts With Bitcoin and Ethereum Support\nBlockFi, a crypto wealth management and lending firm, has launched new cryptocurrency accounts supporting both Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), with 6 percent annual interest paid monthly in crypto. According to this week\u2019s announcement, the interest earned in the BlockFi accounts compounds monthly, with results in an annual percentage yield of 6.2 percent. As well, the accounts are not entirely newly created, as they have been in private beta since the beginning of 2019 and reportedly already hold more than $10 billion in assets.

When talking about the idea of \u201cStacking Sat Saturday\u201d \u2014 \u00a0a trend where users buy $25 in BTC every week to both promote and show crypto adoption \u2014 Dorsey noted that \u201c[he] saw that [Stacking Sat Saturday] on Twitter [\u2026]\u201d. \u201cI would have participated but I have already exceeded my limit on CashApp. I can\u2019t purchase anymore,\u201d \u2013 he said. Since the maximum weekly buy limit on Square\u2019s CashApp is $10,000, Dorsey\u2019s statement implies that he spent $10,000 on cryptocurrency, probably Bitcoin, in one week.

The conference will focus on the most promising projects that have weathered the challenges of the recent crypto bear market.\nAs Cryptopolitan reported in February, initial coin offerings (ICOs) are losing investor interest as much as 95 percent than last year.

The groundwork for this code was laid by Blockstream cryptographers Pieter Wuille and Andrew Poelstra, as well as Yannick Seurin and Gregory Maxwell, in a research paper released in 2018.\nJust over a year later, Blockstream released working code for testing by the wider cryptocurrency community on GitHub in the hopes that it could eventually be merged into the Bitcoin Core code and other projects.\nSchnorr signatures\nDigital signatures provide a cryptographic proof that a transaction was authorized by the owner of a particular private key. Most individual Bitcoin users send transactions with one signature that comes from the owner of the private key of the sending address.\nMultisignatures provide the same kind of cryptographic proof when there are multiple owners of a wallet. In this case, the various owners need to produce their own individual signatures in order to generate a multisignature that authorizes a transaction.\nSchnorr signatures are a specific type of multisignature that provide a couple of important benefits. The name Schnorr comes from the creator of the multisignature algorithm, Claus Schnorr.\nCointelegraph reached out to Blockstream cryptographer Andrew Poelstra to get a better understanding of the intricacies of the proposed MuSig upgrade. As he explains, the algorithm provides a number of benefits:\n\u201cSchnorr multisignatures are one specific type of multisignature which are small (64 bytes regardless of signer set size), which can be verified very efficiently, and which avoid exposing the number of signers to the blockchain.\u201d\nThe reason why this implementation could have a dramatic effect on how the Bitcoin protocol works is due to the current form of multisignature that is used today.\nOnce again, Poelstra explains that the current multisignature, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), is simplistic in that it requires all signers to produce individual signatures that are then included in the relevant transaction.\n\u201cThis means that for 2 signers, twice the blockchain space and twice the verification time are needed to process the transaction. If Bitcoin supported Schnorr signatures rather than ECDSA, this would enable several new technologies - most importantly, Schnorr multisignatures.\u201d\nFor the network of miners that verifies Bitcoin transactions, these Schnorr-based multisignatures are identical to ordinary signatures. This means they are the same size and take the same amount of time to verify, but they are also more private.\nAccording to Poelstra, they don\u2019t reveal the original set of signers, or even provide the number of signers for a multisignature transaction. This should increase the anonymity and privacy of multisignature transactions.\nMuSig\nBitcoin currently uses the ECDSA signature algorithm to verify ownership and transfer of BTC on the blockchain. As Blockstream explained in their original announcement, the ECDSA signature has a number of limitations.\nThe biggest concern is the difficulty of creating multisignatures using ECDSA due to the complexity of the structure of the signatures produced.\nBlockstream\u2019s main concern with ECDSA and other current multisignature schemes is that they assume signers of transactions have control of how and when their keys are generated and that they have a reliable and secure memory.\nIn reality, many Bitcoin users don\u2019t have access to their keys and how they are generated, and they also have no control over third parties and how they use the keys. Blockchain\u2019s proposed MuSig scheme hopes to address this in two ways.\nFirstly, MuSig creates short, consistently sized signatures that look the same to verifiers, no matter how many signers are involved. This aims for efficiency, by relieving the burden of signer details while maintaining security.\nSecondly, MuSig wants to provide provable security using plain public keys. They are aiming to give signers flexibility in the way they produce and provide multisignatures to transactions without having to provide extra information on how the keys were produced.\nIt is noted that this is still an area of difficulty when it comes to Bitcoin key generation due to the variety of key management policies in the ecosystem.\nExtensive testing needed\nWhile Blockstream hopes to provide a workable solution to improved multisignature transactions, they are under no illusion of the challenges of doing so.\nEnsuring the security of multisignature transactions is far more complicated, as it cannot simply use the same hashing method to ensure uniform randomness of signatures through cryptographic hashing.\nSubsequent signers of a multisignature transaction could use other signers\u2019 \u201cnonce\u201d (a hashed number that can only be used once in a cryptographic transaction) for more than one signature.\nThe current solution is to use a session ID for a signing session of a multisignature transaction, which is a temporary one until Blockstream develops a more robust solution.\nReplay attacks are still a concern for multisiganture transactions, given the number of steps involved in verifying a transactions that requires signatures from multiple participants.\nConsidering all of this, Poelstra tells Cointelegraph that the security of Schnorr signatures and their use in MuSig is not a concern:", "birthday": "2019-03-07T17:12:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-07 17:12:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 7}

The first one allegedly lead to a Ledger hardware wallet user losing around 1,680 XMR (nearly $80,000, as of press time) of his funds after making a transaction. The other vulnerability allowed hackers to make fake XMR deposits to cryptocurrency exchanges.\nAnonymity above all: What is Monero and how it works\nMonero is a cryptocurrency with an additional focus on anonymity. It was launched in April 2014, when Bitcointalk.org user thankful_for_today forked the codebase of Bytecoin into the name BitMonero. To create the new coin, he relied on the ideas that were first outlined in a 2013 white paper dubbed \u201cCryptonote\u201d written by anonymous personality Nicolas van Saberhagen. Ironically, BitMonero was soon forked itself by open-source developers and named \u201cMonero\u201d (which means \u201ccoin\u201d in Esperanto). It has remained to be an open-source project ever since.\nIndeed, Monero has considerably more privacy features compared to conventional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC): On top of being a decentralized coin, Monero is designed to be fully anonymous and virtually untraceable. Specifically, it is based on the CryptoNight proof-of-work (PoW) hash algorithm, which allows it to use \u201cring signatures\u201d (which mix the spender's address with a group of others, making it more difficult to trace transactions), \u201cstealth addresses\u201d (which are generated for each transaction and make it impossible to discover the actual destination of a transaction by anyone else other than the sender and the receiver), and \u201cring confidential transactions\u201d (which hide the transferred amount).\nIn 2016, XMR experienced more growth in market capitalization and transaction volume than any other cryptocurrency, undergoing almost a 2,800 percent increase, as per CoinMarketCap.\n\nNotably, a lot of that gain could have come from the underground economy. Being an altcoin that is tailor-made for fully private transactions, Monero eventually became accepted as a form of currency on darknet markets like Alphabay and Oasis, according to Wired. Specifically, after being integrated on those trading platforms in the summer of 2016, Monero\u2019s value \u201cimmediately increased around sixfold.\u201d\n\"That uptick among people who really need to be private is interesting,\" Riccardo \u201cFluffypony\u201d Spagni, one of the Monero core developers, told Wired in January 2017.\n\"If it\u2019s good enough for a drug dealer, it\u2019s good enough for everyone else.\"\nCurrently, XMR is the 13th-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, with equivalent of over $800 million, according to CoinMarketCap data.\nMonero\u2019s alleged privacy remains to be a controversial topic, as some suggest that the coin is not, in fact, fully anonymous. In an interview with Bloomberg, United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Special Agent Lilita Infante noted that, although privacy-focused currencies are less liquid and more anonymous than BTC, the DEA \u201cstill has ways of tracking\u201d altcoins such as Monero and Zcash. Infante concluded:\n\u201cThe blockchain actually gives us a lot of tools to be able to identify people. I actually want them to keep using them [cryptocurrencies].\u201d\nMoreover, as previously reported by Cointelegraph, Monero has been endorsed as \u201cThe Official Currency of the Alt Right\u201d by white supremacists like Christopher Cantwell for its focus on anonymity.\nThe privacy-focused nature of Monero has also driven compliance-oriented crypto exchanges to turn the coin down. For instance, in June 2018, Japan-based Coincheck delisted XMR and three other anonymity-focused altcoins to follow Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures issued by the local financial regulator.\nBug #1: change address bug with Ledger\nStatus: pending\nOn March 3, user MoneroDontCheeseMe started a Reddit thread, claiming that he or she believes to \u201chave just lost ~1680 Monero [around $80,000] due to a bug\u201d while using the Monero app with his or her Ledger hardware wallet.\nAccording to the post, the user transferred about 0.000001 XMR from his or her wallet to a view-only wallet, sent another 10, 200 and then 141.9 XMR. Allegedly, before sending the last transaction, MoneroDontCheeseMe had about 1,690 XMR in the wallet and 141.95 XMR in an unlocked balance, which is why he or she decided to send 141.9 XMR. However, after the transaction had been sent, the user\u2019s wallet is reportedly showing a balance of 0 XMR.\nFurthermore, according to the Reddit user, the amounts sent and the transactions recorded on the blockchain \u201cdon\u2019t line up.\u201d MoneroDontCheeseMe wrote that the 200 XMR transaction actually deducted 1691.001 XMR from the Ledger Wallet, and also that the amounts reported for the 10 XMR transaction are incongruous. Monero core developer nicknamed binaryfate told Cointelegraph over email:\n\u201cMy understanding is that the Ledger may have sent the \u2018change\u2019 amount to an erroneous one-time destination that the user did not control. For more details you should ask the Ledger team directly, they are working on it and already identified and fixed the bug as far as I know, so it should be pushed shortly.\u201d\nInitially, in the comments to the post, Nicolas Bacca, chief technical officer at Ledger, said that their app has been extensively tested, suggesting that could be a synchronization issue.\nHowever, several hours later, Ledger developers published a warning on the Monero subreddit, advising users not to use the Nano S Monero app because \u201cit seems there is a bug with the change address.\u201d\n\u201cThe change seems to not be correctly send. Do not use Ledger Nano S with client 0.14 until more information is provided.\u201d\nThe official Monero Twitter account has since retweeted Ledger\u2019s tweet containing a link to the warning.\nThus, according to Monero\u2019s binaryfate, the Ledger team has prepared a patch to fix the issue, and is expected to release it in the near future. Cointelegraph reached out to MoneroDontCheeseMe to ask him or her whether this issue is being fixed by Monero or Ledger developers, but he or she appeared hesitant to answer straight away and requested more time.\nCointelegraph has also contacted Ledger developers for further comment, but they have not prepared any statement as of press time.\nBug #2: wallet bug enabling hackers to make fake deposits to crypto exchanges\nStatus: fixed\nOn March 3, the official account of the Ryo (RYO) cryptocurrency published a Medium post, highlighting a bug in the XMR wallet software that could allow for sending fake deposits to crypto exchanges.\nAccording to the post, an email reportedly sent to the Monero Announce mailing list warned platforms using the coin that the Monero Vulnerability Response team received a disclosure concerning a vulnerability. The bug was reportedly related to coinbase transactions (the first transaction in a block, created by miners).\n\u201cThis essentially means that the attacker can make it appear as if he deposited any sum of his choosing to an exchange,\u201d the post read. The mentioned email also contained the patch preventing the vulnerability from being exploitable.\nAs binaryfate explained to Cointelegraph, first, somebody made a responsible disclosure following the Monero Vulnerability Response Process. Then, an email was sent to the Monero Announce mailing list \u201cwarning in advance that both a patch and details of the bug would be released together on the 6th of March.\u201d After that, the Monero developer added that Ryo published details \u201cright away\u201d:\n\u201cDue to this article, the details had been made public and delaying would have caused unnecessary risk. Hence a patch was publicly merged on github, and a new version of Monero tagged right away.\u201d", "birthday": "2019-03-06T13:13:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-06 13:13:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 6}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nCrypto companies are attracting talent from traditional industries. This shows that firms in the crypto space are preparing for the long-term, undeterred by the current bear market. Similarly, traditional companies are attempting gain footing in the crypto space. Ernst & Young, one of the Big Four auditing firms, has come up with a tool for calculating taxes on crypto holdings. The software will cater to both institutional and retail clients.\nJapan is among the leaders in adopting cryptocurrencies. Major Japanese banks are gearing up towards improving blockchain and cryptocurrency services to their clients. The government of Argentina has also taken the plunge as it plans to invest in crypto projects along with Binance labs and crypto exchange LatamEx.\nRumors are rife about Starbucks \u2014 which is one of the founding partners of Bakkt \u2014 allowing the use of crypto-based payments shortly after an equity deal. If this becomes a reality, it will increase the exposure of cryptocurrencies.\nEvery day the crypto markets are treated to improved fundamentals. It is only a matter of time before the price of cryptocurrencies responds positively. What do the charts forecast? Let\u2019s find out.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) held on to the 50-day SMA support and climbed above the 20-day EMA on March 5. This shows buying at lower levels, which is a positive sign. If the bulls continue the buying pressure and breakout of $3,900, a retest of $4,255 is probable.\nCurrently, both the moving averages are flat and the RSI is marginally positive. This points to a consolidation in the near term.\n\nIf the BTC/USD pair breaks out of $4,255, it will complete a double bottom pattern, that has a pattern target of $5,273.91. Though there is a stiff resistance at $4,914.11, we expect it to be crossed.\nOn the contrary, if the bears defend the overhead resistances and sink the digital currency below the 50-day SMA, a drop to $3,355.00 is probable. If this level breaks, the critical resistance is at the yearly low of $3,236.09. For now, traders can retain the stops on their long positions below $3,236.09. We shall soon recommend trailing the stop loss higher.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) took support at the 50-day SMA and bounced off it. Currently, it is facing resistance at $144.78. Both the moving averages are flat and the RSI is just above the midpoint. This points to a consolidation in the near term.\n\nThe next up move will start on a break out above $145. The target of this move is $167.32. If this level is scaled, the ETH/USD pair will pick up momentum. Hence, traders can continue to hold the remaining long positions with a stop loss of $125.\nIf the price reverses direction from the current level and breaks down of the 50-day SMA, it can plummet to $116.30, which is a major support. Below this level, the trend will turn in favor of the bears.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) has largely been range bound between $0.33108 and $0.27795 from Jan. 11. Repeated attempts to break out of the overhead resistance have failed to sustain above it. Both the moving averages are flat and the RSI is also at the midpoint. This points to a balance between demand and supply. \u00a0\n\nThe next directional move on the XRP/USD pair will start either on a breakout of $0.33108 or on a breakdown of $0.27795. A breakout of $0.33108 can propel it to the resistance line of the descending channel. On the other hand, a drop below $0.27795 can sink the pair to the yearly low of $0.24508. Therefore, traders can keep the stop loss on the long positions below $0.27795.\nEOS/USD\nEOS successfully completed a retest of the breakout level on March 4 and bounced from it. It is currently at the overhead resistance of $3.8723. If the bulls push the price above this level, a rally to $4.4930 is probable.\n\nBoth the moving averages have curled up and the RSI has jumped into positive territory, which shows that the bulls have the upper hand.\nHowever, if the EOS/USD pair fails to break out of $3.8723 and plunges below $3.1534, it will indicate weakness. Therefore, traders can trail the stop loss on the remaining long positions to $3.10.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) took support at the 20-day EMA and rallied on March 5. It broke above the overhead resistance of $53.40 and invalidated the developing bearish head and shoulders pattern. Failure of a bearish pattern is a bullish sign.\n\nThe LTC/USD pair is currently hitting against the $56.91 resistance. If the price scales above this level, it can move up to $61.5680 and above it to $65.5610. Traders can trail their long positions with a stop loss of $44. If the price closes (UTC time frame) above $56.91, stops can be raised to $50. As partial profits have been booked earlier, traders can trail the stop with enough wiggle room, but protect the paper profits.\nOur bullish view will be negated if the digital currency turns down from the current levels and plunges below the 20-day EMA. The only bearish development on the chart is the negative divergence on the RSI.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has been trading between $120 and $140 for the past few days. The fall below the 50-day SMA on March 4 was arrested at $120.47 and was followed by a strong recovery the next day.\n\nIf the BCH/USD pair breaks out of $140, it is likely to pick up momentum and rally to the next overhead zone of $157.95 to $163.89.\nA failure to break out of $140 will keep the pair range bound for a few more days. The bears will gain an upper hand if the price drops below $120. For now, traders can hold their long positions with the stop loss at $116.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) soared above the overhead resistance of $12 on Feb. 5. It is now likely to rally to $15 and above it to $18. Traders can trail the stops on their long positions to $10. We shall raise the stops again within the next couple of days.\n\nThe trend remains up, with both moving averages sloping up and the RSI close to overbought levels. After the sharp rise on March 5, the BNB/USD pair might consolidate for a few days before resuming its up move.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current level and slips below the 20-day EMA.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) has been consolidating in a tight range of $0.08184371 to $0.09285498 for the past ten days. The 20-day EMA is flat while the 50-day SMA is flattening out. This shows a balance between the buyers and the sellers.\n\nA breakout of $0.10 will tilt the balance in favor of the bulls, while a breakdown of $0.08184371 will indicate weakness.\nAbove $0.10, we anticipate a move to the next overhead resistance of $0.13427050. Hence, traders can buy above $0.10 and keep a stop loss of $0.08.\nConversely, below $0.08184371, a retest of the lows is probable. The XLM/USD pair will resume its downtrend if it slides to a new yearly low.\nTRX/USD\nThough Tron (TRX) dipped below $0.02306493 on March 4, buying at lower levels helped it recover and close (UTC time frame) above the support.\n", "birthday": "2019-03-06T19:22:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-06 19:22:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 6}

First of all, Japan\u2019s Central Bank (BoJ) issued a study on the role of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the current monetary system, a topic that was widely discussed by the country\u2019s officials last year.\nSecondly, major domestic trading company and investment bank, Marubeni Corporation and Daiwa Securities Group, reported blockchain-related advancements in their businesses. Finally, local banking giant Mizuho Financial Group announced the launch of its custom stablecoin.\nTime to observe this news closer and see what has been happening with crypto in Japan.\nIt\u2019s still unclear whether Japan will issue a CBDC\nJapan\u2019s authorities have been notably hesitant about the idea of introducing a CBDC, which might seem surprising at first, given that cryptocurrencies can be used as a legally accepted means of payment in the country (although they are not considered \u201clegal tender\u201d).\nCBDCs \u2014 just like Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins \u2014 are also virtual currencies. The main difference is that they are issued and controlled by a federal regulator. Hence, CBDCs are not decentralized, unlike many digital assets. Basically, they represent fiat money, albeit in digital form. Each CBDC unit acts as a secure digital equivalent to a paper bill and can be powered with distributed ledger technology (DLT).\nConsequently, if central bank decides to issue a CBDC, it becomes not only its regulator, but an account holder as well, as people would have to store and access their digital money via this bank. That places CBDC-issuing central banks on a par with private banks.CBDCs could be seen as central banks\u2019 response to the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies, which bypass regulators\u2019 purview due to their decentralized design. Federally-issued currencies, in turn, aim to take some of the main features from crypto \u2014 namely the convenience and security \u2014 and combine them with the proven attributes of the conventional banking system, in which money circulation is regulated and reserve-backed.\nAt this point, the BoJ has publicly criticized the concept of CBDCs twice. First, in April 2018, its deputy governor, Masayoshi Amamiya, declared that such currencies can have a negative impact on the existing financial system. Specifically, he expressed his concern about taking on the role of private banks:\n\u201cThe issuance of central bank digital currencies for general use could be analogous to allowing households and firms to directly have accounts in the central bank. This may have a large impact on the aforementioned two-tiered currency system and private banks' financial intermediation.\u201d\nThen, on Oct. 20, Masayoshi Amamiya expressed his doubts regarding the effectiveness of CBDCs, adding that his agency won\u2019t be issuing its digital currency in the near future.\nSpecifically, Amamiya responded to a theory suggesting that CBDCs can help governments overcome the \"zero lower bound\" \u2014 a situation in which interest rates fall to zero and the central bank loses the capacity to stimulate the economy. According to this approach, a CBDC would enable central banks to charge more interest on deposits from individuals and firms, and hence motivate them to spend money and vitalize the financial system.\nThe deputy governor questioned that theory, claiming that charging interest on central bank-issued currencies would only work if central banks fully eliminate physical money from the local economy. Otherwise, the public would still continue converting digital currencies into cash in order to avoid paying interest.\nThe elimination of fiat money in Japan is \u201cnot an option for us as a central bank,\u201d since cash is a popular method of payment in the country, Amamiya added. Indeed, Japanese society is still mostly cash-based, as about 65 percent of transactions are reportedly done in paper money (which is more than double that of other developed economies).\n\nThe BOJ deputy governor continued that thought by stressing that his agency is not planning on creating a CBDC that can be widely used by the public for settlement and payment purposes. The shift to bank-issued crypto from the existing sovereign currencies seems to be \"quite a high hurdle,\u201d as crypto assets are often associated with speculative investments and do not represent a stable means of payment, he noted.\nFurther, the central bank examined the role of CBDCs in the current monetary system in a report released on Feb. 19. The paper was written by representatives of the University of Tokyo and the BoJ.\nThe report divided possible CBDCs into two categories, the first being those accessible to the general public for daily transactions instead of banknotes and the other as those limited for large-value settlements.\nInterestingly, after explaining that CBDCs of the latter kind wouldn\u2019t bring a lot of new features to the monetary system \u2014 as it has already been digitized \u2014 the report\u2019s authors focused on the first category throughout most of the document. The report stressed that DLT could be applied to such token-based CBDCs.\nThe working paper noted that blockchain-based CBDC could lower the level of anonymity of its users, as cash money cannot be tracked and hence is used for criminal activities. Here, the authors referenced the example of the People's Bank of China (PBoC), which announced its intent to issue a digital currency to curb tax evasion back in 2016.\nNotably, the document doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect the official views of the BoJ and was published to stimulate further discussion on the topic, which suggests that Japanese officials have not given up on the idea of issuing a CBDC.\nThe FSA continues to apply scrutiny toward the local crypto industry\nThe Financial Services Agency (FSA), the national financial regulator, is known to have a tight grip on local digital asset exchanges. It comes as no surprise, given that the country has witnessed the two largest crypto hacks in history: namely, last year\u2019s outlandish $532 million Coincheck hack and the notorious crash of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox. In the wake of those security breaches, the watchdog has introduced numerous precautions, including on-site inspections of exchanges\u2019 offices and mandatory risk management system reports.\nAs per Japan\u2019s Payment Services Act, amended in April 2017, all digital currency exchanges in the country are required to be registered with the FSA. The agency has granted the most compliant players with licenses. Currently, the pool of exchanges cleared to serve the Japanese market currently is represented by 17 platforms: Money Partners, Liquid (previously known as Quoine), Bitflyer, BitBank, SBI Virtual Currencies, GMO Coin, Btcbox, Bitpoint, Fisco Virtual Currency, Zaif, Tokyo Bitcoin Exchange, Bit Arg Exchange Tokyo, FTT Corporation, Xtheta Corporation, Huobi and Coincheck. The latter managed to secure its license just recently, almost a year after it suffered from a major hack.\nNotably, the agency\u2019s tough supervision has prompted some major players to quit the Japanese market. Thus, Binance, one of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges that had once opened an office in the country, turned to Malta \u2014 the famously crypto-friendly country \u2014 after the Japanese regulator had slapped it with a warning in March 2018. Similarly, local social messaging app Line has also decided to exclude the domestic market prior to the launch of its cryptocurrency exchange, citing local regulatory difficulties.\nNevertheless, the FSA\u2019s severity hasn\u2019t scared everyone off. As many as 190 exchanges are reportedly pending the agency\u2019s approval to enter the local market. Perhaps the most notable example here is United States-based Coinbase, which has made positive remarks about Japan\u2019s crypto regulatory climate in the past, saying that the FSA\u2019s intense focus on security is \u201cgood for us.\u201d Given that Coinbase originally planned to establish its operation in Japan within 2018, the financial agency is likely to approve or decline its application at some point in the next few months.\nMoreover, the Japanese arm of the internet giant Yahoo will reportedly open their own crypto exchange \u201cin April 2019 or later.\u201d Other players that will potentially open a crypto exchange in Japan include Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, the largest domestic bank, and Money Forward, the company behind a popular financial management application.\nIn December 2018, the FSA published a draft report that introduced the new regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) in the country. In it, the agency continued to strengthen security requirements for local crypto exchanges, focusing on private keys management, among other things. Further, the FSA urged players to join the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA), a self-regulatory body comprised of domestic industry participants. Moreover, the financial watchdog suggested that ICOs might become subject to securities regulation in the future. Indeed, previously, local media reported that the agency was going to introduce new ICO regulations to protect investors from fraud.\nOne of the FSA\u2019s potential next steps is to regulate unregistered firms that solicit investments in cryptocurrencies. According to Cointelegraph Japan, there is a loophole in the country\u2019s existing regulatory framework that allows unidentified companies that collect funds in crypto rather than fiat currencies to stay in a gray zone, and the watchdog intends to close it.\nIndustry players have asked to reduce the current tax rate\nIn February 2019, the Japan Association of New Economy (JANE), a business industry association led by Hiroshi Mikitani, the CEO of Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten, asked the FSA to reduce the current tax rate for crypto trading income.\nSpecifically, JANE inquired whether it was possible to tax crypto in compliance with progressive taxation instead of general taxation.\nAccording to Cointelegraph Japan, income from trading cryptocurrencies is currently taxed at 55 percent in Japan. Imposing progressive taxation on crypto gains would reduce it to 20 percent \u2014 the same rate that is applied to stocks and forex markets in the country. The association has also asked the FSA to impose no tax on crypto-to-crypto transactions.\nPreviously, in October 2018, local news agency Sankei reported that the Japanese National Tax Agency was planning to adjust the tax filing system for cryptocurrencies in order to corroborate that local traders report their gains.\nCurrently, such profits are classified as \u201cmiscellaneous income\u201d in the country. Basically, Japanese crypto holders have to pay between 15 and 55 percent on gains declared on their annual tax filings. The top amount applies to people who earn more than 40 million yen ($365,000) annually.\nStablecoins and bank-controlled digital currencies are on the rise in Japan\nOver the past few months, at least two major digital currencies developed by Japan\u2019s major banks and IT-industry players have received important updates, , the origins of which \u2013 as well as a detailing of related projects \u2013 was covered in a separate Cointelegraph article.\nJ-coin\nJapanese banking giant Mizuho Financial Group, which has over $1.8 trillion in total assets, will reportedly launch its bespoke stablecoin for payments and remittance services as soon as March 1.\nDubbed \u201cJ-Coin,\u201d the new digital currency platform aims to directly link existing bank accounts with digital wallets. According to reports, the project is being developed in a partnership with around 60 counterpart financial institutions \u2014 which host around 56 million user accounts combined.\nThe currency will reportedly be managed by a dedicated mobile app, J-Coin Pay, which uses QR codes at checkout to complete retail payments. As per local financial newspaper Nikkei Asian Review, the currency will resemble a stablecoin fixed at a price of 1 yen (~$0.01) per unit, while transfers between bank accounts and J-Coin wallets are set to be free of charge.\nGYEN\nIn February, domestic IT giant GMO Internet confirmed its plans to launch a yen-backed stablecoin called GYEN this year.\nThere are few details about the project at the moment. The company\u2019s representatives has so far only revealed that the firm has set up a subsidiary and appointed a person responsible for GYEN operations to issue the stablecoin in 2019.\nThe company had to shut down some of its other crypto-related operations, however. In late December, GMO announced it was quitting the Bitcoin mining hardware sector, citing \u201cextraordinary loss\u201d in Q4 last year. In Q3, GMO's cryptocurrency projects reportedly brought the company around 2.6 billion yen ($22.8 million) despite \u201cthe harsh external environment.\u201d\nJapan\u2019s largest firms are actively tapping blockchain for their business\nNumerous Japanese private firms \u2014 including banks, brokerages, trading giants and IT players \u2014 have announced blockchain-related news within the past few months, cementing Japan\u2019s reputation as one of the most technology-focused countries. Here are the main companies, along with their projects:\nBanks and brokerage\nSumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), Japan\u2019s second-largest bank\nIn February, SMBC completed a proof-of-concept (PoC) using blockchain consortium R3\u2019s Marco Polo trade finance platform. Marco Polo is a Corda-powered venture developed by R3 and Irish tech firm TradeIX, connecting banks via a trade network.\nSMBC, which is currently the only Japanese bank participating in the Marco Polo scheme, said it had partnered with Mitsui & Co. \u2014 one of the largest \u201csogo shosha\u201d (general trading companies) in Japan \u2014 to enhance efficiency in trade processes.\n\u201c[The] PoC was conducted between SMBC and Mitsui & Co. which aims to improve productivity in its trade operations, by testing modules such as Receivable Finance and Payment Commitment (Payment Undertaking),\u201d the press release explained, adding:\n\u201cSMBC expects to commercialize Marco Polo in the first half of FY2019 [the financial year 2019] after verification of the PoC.\u201d\nDaiwa Securities Group, Japan\u2019s second-largest securities brokerage\nDaiwa Securities had also announced the completion of a blockchain PoC.\nThe pilot project, dubbed \u201cJPX Proof-of-Concept Testing for Utilization of Blockchain / DLT in Capital Market Infrastructure,\u201d allegedly involved 26 companies, including financial institutions, system providers and institutional investors. The reported goal of the pilot was to increase the efficiency of blockchain tech in the post-trade process.\nAccording to the results of the trial, the blockchain system is expected to reduce operational costs and allow for the easier development of new products and services.\nSBI Holdings, the first bank to own a cryptocurrency exchange in Japan\nSBI Holdings has also struck an agreement with R3 to work in Japan, purportedly to develop local use of its Corda blockchain platform.\nAccording to the official announcement, the new joint venture will \u201csupport provision and introduction of the Corda license, arrange schemes for its actual use beforehand, as well as promote collaboration with overseas offices of R3 and other Corda partners.\u201d\nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the world\u2019s fifth-largest bank\nOn Feb. 20, MUFG announced it will launch a new blockchain-based payment system in collaboration with U.S. content delivery network Akamai.\nTitled the \u201cGlobal Open Network,\u201d the platform aims to utilize MUFG\u2019s payment industry reach to strengthen its position in the increasingly competitive blockchain payments market.

However, there have been a few encounters between the tech mogul and crypto to date \u2014 after all, given Musk\u2019s previous experience at PayPal, he couldn\u2019t pass up the innovative digital payment method.\nHere\u2019s how his relationship with crypto has evolved since 2014, when he made his first public comments about Bitcoin.\nOctober, 2014: Elon Musk argues that Bitcoin will be mostly used for illegal transactions\nOn Oct. 8, 2014, Musk was interviewed by Walter Isaacson on stage at Vanity Fair's New Establishment Summit. At some point, Isaacson asked the Tesla CEO whether he thought that Bitcoin would be disruptive to fiat currencies, to which he replied:\n\u201cI think Bitcoin is probably a good thing. I think it's primarily going to be a means of doing illegal transactions. But that's not necessarily entirely bad. You know, some things maybe shouldn't be illegal.\"\nMusk then added:\n\"It will be useful for legal and illegal transactions. Otherwise, it would have no value as a use for illegal transactions, because you have to have a legal-to-illegal bridge.\"\nThe entrepreneur followed his comments by disclosing that he didn\u2019t own any BTC at the time.\nNovember 2017: Musk clarifies he is not Satoshi, says he owns \u201cpart of BTC\u201d\nOn Nov. 22, Sahil Gupta, who is allegedly a former intern at SpaceX, wrote a Medium entry speculating that Musk could be Satoshi Nakamoto, the original creator of Bitcoin.\nSpecifically, Gupta emphasized Musk's background in economics, experience in production-level software and history of innovation to postulate that Musk could have invented Bitcoin.\nThe theory was very soon disproved by Musk himself, who tweeted that Gupta\u2019s suggestion \u201cis not true.\u201d The SpaceX CEO added, however, that he now had \u201cpart of BTC\u201d a friend sent him a few years back. \u00a0\nDecember 2017: Musk says that he has never heard about Bitcoin\nOn Dec. 22, Neeraj K. Agrawal, an employee of nonprofit crypto research institution CoinCenter, took to Twitter to ask Musk whether he created Bitcoin, to which the tech tycoon replied that he \u201cnever heard of it,\u201d linking a satirical article on The Onion titled \u201cBitcoin Plunge Reveals Possible Vulnerabilities In Crazy Imaginary Internet Money.\u201d\nJanuary 2018: Musk references crypto hype to promote a flamethrower \u00a0\nIn January 2018, when major altcoins were enjoying their all-time highs following the Bitcoin\u2019s record-breaking ascent, Musk used the consequent crypto hype to promote a flamethrower released by his tunnel construction firm, the Boring Company:\n\u201cThe flamethrower is sentient, its safe word is \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019 and it comes with a free blockchain.\u201d\nFebruary 2018: Musk comments on Twitter crypto scams, reveals how much BTC he is holding\nIn February last year, the SpaceX CEO addressed a growing Twitter trend, whereas scammers would pose as famous figures like Musk or Donald Trump and trick users into sending them cryptocurrency.\nReplying to one of the tweets asking why such spamming was so widespread, Musk claimed that he had already contacted Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey regarding this issue.\n\u201cI literally own zero cryptocurrency, apart from .25 BTC that a friend sent me many years ago,\u201d he also disclosed, which seems to check out with the aforementioned comment about his crypto holdings.\nAt the time, his BTC tokens amounted to around $2,531. As of now, that number would be even more modest, being set at around the $975 mark.\nInterestingly, just few days prior to Musk\u2019s tweet, Tesla\u2019s Amazon Web Service\u2019s (AWS) software container was hacked by cryptojackers. Specifically, fraudsters accessed Tesla\u2019s AWS access credentials by penetrating a nonpassword-protected Kubernetes software container. Then, they used that container to mine Bitcoin for an unknown amount of time. The attack was well coordinated, as the hackers set up their own mining pool software, then connected the malicious script to an \u201cunlisted\u201d endpoint, and kept their CPU usage at a low level to prevent being spotted.\nPrior to that, in December 2017, an owner of a Tesla S electric car reported that he had been mining Bitcoin with his car\u2019s supercharger, placing a mining rig in the trunk.\nMarch 2018: Musk is spotted holding a book about cryptocurrencies\nIn March, a photo of Musk holding a book titled \u201cCryptocurrencies Simply Explained\u201d surfaced online. The picture was taken at South by Southwest festival, where the entrepreneur allegedly took one item from the crowd to sign. According to the book\u2019s author, Julian Hosp, Musk kept the book.\n\nSource: photo by Ryan Chylinski on Twitter\nOctober 2018: Musk jokes about selling Bitcoin, gets banned from Twitter\nOn Oct. 22, Tesla CEO provoked some rumors about his company\u2019s involvement with cryptocurrencies by posting a tweet that said \u201cwanna buy Bitcoin?\u201d The image attached to the post was taken from the Cryptocurrency Girls website, which depicts major cryptocurrencies as anime characters.\nLater, Musk confirmed it was a gag. \"I was just joking,\" he said during a recent podcast hosted by advisory services firm ARK Invest. \u201cBitcoin and Ethereum scammers were so rampant on Twitter, I decided to join in and I said at one point wanna buy some Bitcoin?\u201d\nAfter the tweet, the entrepreneur's account was briefly suspended \u201cbecause of some automatic rule against selling Bitcoin or something,\u201d as he explained.\nNovember 2018: Fraudsters steal $157,000 worth of crypto after hacking verified Twitter accounts\nOn Nov. 5, British news agency Telegraph reported that fraudsters stole 120,000 euros (around $157,000), after posing as Musk and promoting a fake cryptocurrency giveaway on Twitter.\nSpecifically, the hackers broke into Twitter accounts of clothing retailer Matalan and Path\u00e9 UK, the British arm of the French filmmaker, and posted messages advertising the giveaway. Since both accounts were verified, the followers were more likely to take their message at face value.\nThe post claimed that Musk was leaving Tesla and was giving away free Bitcoin via a typical form for Twitter crypto-related scams: The followers were encouraged to send a small amount of Bitcoin to a given wallet address and promised a much larger amount in return.\nAccording to the Telegraph report, more than 300 people had fallen victim to the scam.", "birthday": "2019-03-03T15:23:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-03 15:23:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 3}

However, some clients have since reported that they are struggling to delete their accounts.\nCoinbase has confirmed that they were aware of Neutrino senior employees\u2019 background, but found their technology \u201cindustry leading.\u201d Interestingly, Coinbase has also admitted that their previous providers were selling client data to outside parties.\nNeutrino\u2019s key staff have been involved with Hacking Team, the Italy-based controversial outfit\nOn Feb. 19, Coinbase reported acquiring the Italy-based firm Neutrino to improve safety and boost its Anti Money-Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) measures. The accompanying statement read:\n\u201cBy analyzing data on public blockchains, Neutrino will help us prevent theft of funds from peoples\u2019 accounts, investigate ransomware attacks, and identify bad actors. It will also help us bring more cryptocurrencies and features to more people while helping ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.\u201d\nNeutrino was founded in 2016 by Giancarlo Russo, Marco Valleri (also known as \u201cNaGa\u201d) and Alberto Ornaghi (also known as \u201cALoR\u201d). All of them are directly related to Hacking Team.\nFirst, in 2001, ALoR and NaGa created Ettercap, a \"comprehensive suite for man-in-the-middle attacks.\" The program has since been widely used for intercepting traffic, capturing passwords and eavesdropping, becoming \u201cthe Swiss army knife\" for remote hacking.\nEventually, ALoR and NaGA were allegedly contacted by the Milan police department, who asked the developers to create a Windows driver that would enable them to monitor Skype calls. To put such cooperation on a larger scale, in 2003, ALoR and NaGa founded Hacking Team, a commercial hacking software company. As of now, the company\u2019s technology is \u201cused daily to fight crime in six continents,\u201d as per its website.\nAccording to Russo\u2019s LinkedIn profile, he joined the company in 2009 as its chief financial officer, later becoming its chief operating officer.\nIn 2015, Hacking Team was hacked, and 500 GB of client files, contracts, financial documents and internal emails were leaked online. At the time, the company was reportedly selling its spyware to countries including Ethiopia, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates and the U.S. \u2014 with the Drug Enforcement Administration and Federal Bureau of Investigation among its customers \u2014 according to a Motherboard investigation. Following the security breach, Hacking Team purportedly lost some of its key clients.\nNotably, Hacking Team\u2019s software has reportedly been used by authoritarian governments to spy on journalists and activists. For instance, according to Motherboard, the firm has been involved in hacking UAE human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor, who was then detained and sentenced to 10 years in prison.\nIn May 2016, Russo, Valleri (NaGa) and Ornaghi (ALoR) founded Neutrino. The company took a somewhat similar course, albeit on the field of cryptocurrencies. Thus, its key product, XFlow nSpect, has been designed \u201cspecifically for Law Enforcement agencies,\u201d representing a \u201ccomprehensive solution for monitoring, analyzing and tracking cryptocurrency flows across multiple blockchains,\u201d the website states.\nIn 2017, Neutrino tracked funds associated with the ransomware hackers known as WannaCry and concluded that they converted their Bitcoin (BTC) into Monero (XMR), a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency, via Switzerland-based crypto exchange ShapeShift.\nCommunity and Coinbase reaction\nSoon after Coinbase announced its acquisition, crypto community members started to point out that Neutrino was founded by Hacking Team\u2019s former employees. For instance, Amber Baldet, co-founder and CEO of the startup Clovyr and former lead at JPMorgan Chase's Blockchain Center of Excellence (BCOE), tweeted:\n\u201cWhen I said it would be great to have more infosec people involved in the \u2018crypto\u2019 space, I didn\u2019t mean the largest US exchange should acquire an analysis tools company run by a former Hacking Team member, but here we are.\u201d\nAround Feb. 20, crypto community members kicked off the hashtag #DeleteCoinbase, which has amassed hundreds of tweets as of press time.\nInterestingly, Coinbase has commented on the issue, admitting that they knew about Neutrino\u2019s roots. By Feb. 26, the exchange\u2019s spokesperson told Motherboard that his firm \u201cdoes not condone nor will it defend the actions of Hacking Team,\u201d adding:\n\u201cWe are aware that Neutrino\u2019s co-founders previously worked at Hacking Team, which we reviewed as part of our security, technical, and hiring diligence.\u201d\nThe Coinbase representative further explained that Neutrino\u2019s technology basically seemed too good to be ignored:\n\u201cIncreasingly, third-party blockchain analysis companies are requesting customer data from cryptocurrency companies that they serve. It was important for Coinbase to bring this function in-house to fully control and protect our customers' data and Neutrino\u2019s technology was the best we encountered in the space to achieve this goal.\u201d\nOn March 1, Christine Sandler, Coinbase\u2019s director of institutional sales, expanded on that statement in an interview with Cheddar. First, she confirmed that her company was aware of Neutrino\u2019s connection to Hacking Team, but wanted to employ their technology nonetheless:\n\"We are aware of the backgrounds of some of the folks that were involved in Neutrino and we are looking into that. The compelling reason for making the acquisition was that Neutrino had some really industry leading and best-in-class technology.\u201d", "birthday": "2019-03-03T12:05:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-03 12:05:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 3}

The listings, which had been announced earlier this month, are BNC\u2019s Bitcoin Liquid Index (BLX) and Ethereum Liquid Index (ELX). According to the announcement, the indexes will show reference rates for the price of 1 BTC and 1 ETH, quoted in USD and refreshed every 30 seconds. Brave New Coin has also announced future plans to add another index for tracking the price of Ripple (XRP).\nSamsung Announces Galaxy S10 Crypto Partners, Bitcoin and Ethereum Support\nSouth Korean tech giant Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy S10 smartphone will reportedly have crypto wallet functions for both Ethereum and Bitcoin, as well as two other tokens. The much-discussed crypto features seemed to have been revealed at the Mobile World Congress this week, where Samsung presented the various projects featured on the smartphone, including support for the cosmetic industry-focused COSMEE token (COSM) and crypto gaming-focused Enjin\u2019s token (ENJ). Also this week, anonymous sources had reported that Enjin Wallet would be backing a blockchain wallet in Samsung\u2019s new smartphone.\n\nJamie Dimon Says JPM Coin Could Eventually Find Consumer Use\nJamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, said this week that the company\u2019s previously announced JPM Coin could eventually see consumer use. The bank\u2019s proposed digital asset had been announced by the U.S. banking giant last week, noting that the coin could increase settlement efficiency in several of its operations. However, Dimon\u2019s comments to CNBC this week implied a wider focus for the coin\u2019s use, as he noted that it \u201ccould be internal, could be commercial, it could one day be consumer.\u201d The JPM Coin has been both lauded and opposed by those in the crypto community, with some suggesting it defeats the purpose of crypto itself.\nNew York Times: Facebook Reportedly Shopping \u2018Facebook Coin\u2019 to Crypto Exchanges\nSocial media giant Facebook is reportedly \u201choping to succeed where Bitcoin failed\u201d with its highly secretive cryptocurrency project, according to anonymous sources speaking to the New York Times. This week, the Times wrote more about Facebook\u2019s alleged coin that had previously been revealed, noting through its sources that the company planned to integrate WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram into one entity and provide the newly unified service with a crypto token. According to the unnamed sources, Facebook is far enough along in the project that they have been meeting with crypto exchanges about the possibility of listing the so-called \u201cFacebook Coin.\u201d\nEthereum\u2019s Constantinople and St. Petersburg Upgrades Have Been Activated\nEthereum\u2019s next two network upgrades, known as Constantinople and St. Petersburg, have successfully taken place this week on the main network at block 7,280,000, in accordance with the previously released schedule. The two updates have been combined into one event, following the delay of the Constantinople upgrade in January over a newly discovered security vulnerability. While Constantinople adds the so-called \u201cdifficulty bomb\u201d and the decrease of Ethereum\u2019s block reward, St. Petersburg is meant to delete a previous update, Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1283, from Ethereum\u2019s test networks, as the EIP has been identified to have security vulnerabilities.\n\nWinners and Losers\nThe crypto markets are slightly down by the end of the week, with Bitcoin trading at around $3,854, Ethereum at $134 and Ripple around $0.31. The total market cap is at about $130 billion.\nThe top-three altcoin gainers of the week are RegalCoin, Archetypal Network and President Trump. The top-three altcoin losers of the week are ICE ROCK MINING, PonziCoin and CapdaxToken.\n\nFor more info on crypto prices, make sure to read Cointelegraph\u2019s\u00a0market analysis.\nMost Memorable Quotations\n\u201cLet\u2019s do this in Europe, the avant-garde of agricultural technology, by developing tools that will track every product from raw material production to packaging and processing.

EY identified six separate crypto wallets that had been used to store Bitcoin, but noted that there had been no deposits in the wallet since April of last year (besides one for $500,000), noting that they cannot find a reason as to why the wallets had been ceased. EY also included in its report the discovery of 14 user accounts that appear to have been created outside the normal process by Quadriga, which were then used to trade on the exchange\u2019s platform.\nCrypto Mining Service Coinhive to Shut Down Operations in March \nCoinhive, a crypto mining service that specifically targets altcoin Monero (XMR), has announced that it will be shutting down operations in March 2018. According to the blog post, the project has become economically inviable due to the market conditions, as well as the more than 50 percent drop in hash rate following the last Monero hard fork. XMR has dropped around 85 percent over the course of the year, the blog post noted, underlining that it contributed to the decision to discontinue Coinhive.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nThe crypto markets are showing signs of bottoming out. Bitcoin gained about 11 percent in February, its first month to close positively since July of 2018.\nBitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency being favored by the market participants. \u00a0A number of other major coins are also looking strong and have recovered from their lows.\nThe news of Facebook exploring options to launch its own cryptocurrency has been received as bullish. The new Samsung smartphone, Galaxy S10 will have a crypto wallet for Bitcoin and Ethereum. All these efforts will introduce cryptocurrencies to a global audience.\nThe fundamentals in the crypto industry have been improving for the past few months. The institutional players are recognizing these developments and have started making forays into the space.\nWe expect greater participation from the institutions after the cryptocurrency market at large confirms a bottom. Hence, the traders can start initiating positions in the coins that have bottomed out or are displaying a good risk to reward ratio.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Launchpad platform has concluded a successful sale of the Fetch.AI (FET) token within 22 seconds on Feb. 25. This shows that there is market demand for what Binance Launchpad does.\nA few weeks back, a similarly successful sale of Tron-based BitTorrent token (BTT) had completed in 15\u201318 minutes. In order to speed up the launch of its mainnet, Binance is handing out rewards for testing the company\u2019s new decentralized trading platform Binance DEX. Binance Coin (BNB) has benefitted from these positive headlines.\nCan the price move higher? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe BNB/USD pair has risen by almost 174 percent from its early-December lows. After the recent pullback, the price has covered a lot of ground and now remains only about 56 percent below its lifetime highs. This clearly shows a strong demand for the digital currency.\nCurrently, the price is close to the critical overhead resistance of $12. A break out of this can carry the pair towards the next target of $15, and above it to $18.\nOn the other hand, if the bulls fail to scale and sustain above $12, a few days of consolidation or a minor dip cannot be ruled out. While short-term traders can buy on a breakout above $12, the long-term players can wait for a minor dip to enter.\nBSV/USD\nBitcoin SV (BSV) was the second-best performer of the week. It rallied sharply on Feb. 25 and 26 as the cryptocurrency got listed by payment processor CoinGate, as well as by a Turkish exchange Vebitcoin.\nIncreased support has been welcomed by market participants. Can the price move up, or will it give up all the recent gains?\n\nThe BSV/USD pair has a short trading history. It is currently trying to bottom out closer to the support at $65.031. Multiple attempts to sink the pair have failed, as selling dries up at lower levels. This is a positive sign that shows that buyers are keen to invest on the dips.\nIf the price closes (UTC time frame) above $71.412, it will be likely to rally to $123.980.\nConversely, if the pair breaks down of the immediate support at $58.072, a drop to the low at $38.528 will become probable.\nLTC/USD\nThe Litecoin (LTC) Foundation has partnered with premier kickboxing league Glory to make LTC the official cryptocurrency for Glory\u2019s various events and its online merchandise platform. With this, Litecoin aims to reach out to the large fanbase of the league.\n\nThe LTC/USD pair has not given up much ground after hitting the overhead resistance of $47.2460 three weeks ago. This shows that the bulls are in no urgency to book profits after the rally from the lows.\nIf the price breaks out and sustains above $47.2460, it will indicate a probable bottom. The 20-day EMA has flattened out, and the RSI has also climbed close to the midpoint. This shows that the bulls are at an advantage in the near term.\nTraders can buy on a weekly close (UTC time frame) above $47.2460, and keep a stop loss below $29 initially. This can be trailed higher to $40 within the next several days. The target to watch on the upside is $69, and above it $94.\nHowever, if the digital currency fails to sustain above $47.2460, it can again turn down and correct to $40, and below it to $29.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) got listed on the Coinbase Pro trading platform on Feb. 25. On Feb. 28, Coinbase announced support for the digital currency on its retail platform and mobile apps.\nNasdaq is also planning to list a separate index tracking the price of Ripple. The Thai Securities and Exchange Commission has included Ripple in the list of tokens suitable for initial coin offerings.\nWhile some believed that Ripple had to offer Coinbase a certain incentive or money to get listed, the company has denied it. Although there was a lot of talk about JPM, the recently announced stablecoin by JPMorgan Chase, a research by Binance has concluded that it will not be a threat to Ripple\u2019s XRP token in the near term.\n\nThe XRP/USD pair continues to trade inside a descending channel. It is currently attempting to rise after taking support at $0.27795. However, it is facing selling close to the 20-week EMA.\nA rise above this could push the price to the resistance line of the descending channel near $0.40. A breakout and close (UTC time frame) above the channel will indicate a change in trend.\nOn the other hand, if the bulls fail to break out of the 20-week EMA, the bears will again try to break down of $0.27795. A drop below the support zone of $0.24508 \u2013$0.27795 will resume the downtrend.", "birthday": "2019-03-03T18:36:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-03 18:36:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 3}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nThe market tends to cycle between periods of low and high volatility. After a week of small-price-range action, the range expanded on Monday and the crypto markets decided to move southwards. What has caused this sudden fall? There are no specific fundamental reasons that might have led to this selloff.\nOne of the possibilities might be the strengthening dollar, which has risen in the past four days. Gold also fell sharply on Friday, as a consequence.\nThis shows that traders are keen to take on risk. Traders like to keep the assets that are showing a strong uptrend. The United States markets have been on a roll for the past ten weeks. Positive news on the trade deal between the U.S. and China might have encouraged some short-term traders to book profits in cryptocurrencies and shift over to the stock markets.\nAlthough the current fall will dampen sentiment, it does not change the overall structure of most major cryptocurrencies. They remain in a bottoming formation and will continue to be volatile during the period.\nBTC/USD\nAfter six days of small-range trading, the range has expanded to the downside, which is a negative sign. Bitcoin (BTC) has broken below the 20-day EMA and is currently close to the 50-day SMA. The downtrend line is also located at this level. This line had previously acted as a strong resistance, so it will now act as a strong support.\n\nA breakdown of this critical support can plummet the BTC/USD pair to the next support at $3,355, and if it also fails to hold, the final support on the downside is $3,236.09. A new yearly low will resume the downtrend.\nConversely, if the price finds support at the current levels, it will again try to rally above $3,900 and reach $4,255. A break out of this critical resistance will suggest that a bottom has been put in place. The next few days are critical. Traders can maintain the stop loss on their long positions below $3,236.09.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) has broken down of the 20-day EMA and has declined to the 50-day SMA. The failure to bounce off the 20-day EMA is a negative sign. If the 50-day SMA also fails to stem the fall, the next support on the downside is $116.3. Therefore, traders should keep a stop loss of $125 on the remaining long positions.\n\nOn the other hand, if the ETH/USD pair rebounds from the current levels, it will try to rise above $145 and reach the critical overhead resistance of $167.32. The pair will pick up momentum above this level. Currently, both of the moving averages are flat, and the RSI is just below the 50 levels. This points to range bound trading in the short-term.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) has turned down below the moving averages. It has again slipped to the support at $0.2950. This is the fourth time the price has fallen to this level.\nRepeated retests of a support level increase the probability of a breakdown. If this support cracks, the next level to watch on the downside is $0.27795. The bulls have held this support twice: once in mid-December of last year and again in end-January of 2019.\nHence, this is a critical level. A breakdown of this could plummet the digital currency to the yearly low of $0.24508.\n\nIf the buyers step in at the current levels, the XRP/USD pair can move up to $0.33108. A breakout and close above this level is likely to propel the pair to the resistance line of the descending channel, close to $0.40. The traders should protect their long positions with a stop loss below $0.27795.\nEOS/USD\nEOS has broken below the 20-day EMA and plummeted to the next support of $3.2081. If the bulls fail to defend this level, the drop can extend to the 50-day SMA. The traders can keep their stops at $2.90 on the remaining long positions.\n\nA bounce from the current levels will again try to push the EOS/USD pair above the overhead resistance of $3.8723. The 20-day EMA is flattening out, and the RSI has also dipped close to the neutral zone. This shows a balance between demand and supply.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) had risen above $47.2460 on March 2, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. The price has again corrected to the 20-day EMA, forming a head and shoulders pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close below the neckline.\nThe potential breakdown has a pattern target of $32.00. However, $40.4240, the 50-day SMA and the uptrend line can act as important supports.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is flattening out, and the RSI has also declined to the midpoint. This shows that the bulls are losing their edge in the short term. But if the LTC/USD pair rebounds either from the 20-day EMA, or from the neckline, it will again try to scale above $50 and prolong its recovery. The traders can keep a stop loss of $40 on the remaining long position.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) could not break out of the 20-day EMA for the past five days, which attracted selling. The price has broken down of the 50-day SMA, which is a bearish sign. It can now drop to $116.79, and below it to $105. Traders who are holding long positions can keep their stop loss at $116.\n\nThe BCH/USD pair will prove us wrong if it reverses direction from the current levels and breaks out of $140. Until then, every rise will be likely to attract selling. The RSI is in the negative zone, but the moving averages are still flat, which points to a likely consolidation.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) closed above $12 on March 2, thereby triggering our buy suggested in the previous analysis. However, the close above $12 attracted profit booking by the bulls that have dragged the price back into the critical support zone of $10\u2013$12.\n\nBoth of the moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is in the positive zone, which shows that the trend is up. The first support on the downside is the 20-day EMA, and below it $9.2450296. If these support levels fail to hold, the slide can extend to the 50-day SMA.\nConversely, if the BNB/USD pair bounces off the 20-day EMA and breaks out of $12, it could move up to $15, and above it to $18. Therefore, traders who have entered long positions can keep their stop loss at $9.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) tried to break out of the overhead resistance at $0.09285498 on March 3, but failed. Currently, the price has turned around and broken below the moving averages. A break below $0.08184371 can result in a retest of the yearly low.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is flat, and the 50-day SMA is sloping down. The RSI has also slipped below the 50 levels, which shows that the sellers are at an advantage.\nOur bearish view will be invalidated if the XLM/USD pair turns around from the current levels and breaks out of $0.10. The pair has been a huge underperformer, as it did not participate in the recent pullback. This shows a lack of interest among the market participants to own this coin. We shall wait for a trend reversal before recommending a trade in it.\nTRX/USD\nTron (TRX) has broken down of the support at $0.02306493, and is close to the next support at $0.02113440. If this level breaks, the next support to watch on the downside is \u00a0$0.01830000. The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover, which is a negative sign.\n", "birthday": "2019-03-04T22:50:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-04 22:50:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 4}

One of its platform\u2019s features is the Strategy Builder, a tool enabling users to create trading strategies and sequences using a simple drag-and-drop interface. Once a strategy has been built, it is executed as soon as certain conditions are met.\nIn the spirit of compatibility, the Kyiv-based startup says its terminals give traders the opportunity to trade on any exchange from one place. While it has supported Bittrex, Binance and Coinbase since its launch, developers are planning to add Bitfinex, Poloniex, Bitmex and KuCoin in the not-too-distant future.\nLaunched in 2018, Superorder raised $500,000 in a funding round in August, which was led by the Ukrainian venture capital firm SMRK VC Fund.\n\u201cFully customizable\u201d\nSuperorder says its terminal caters to newcomers and professionals alike.

The terminal offers a total of nine building blocks that traders can choose from when developing their strategies. As well as limit and market orders, where cryptocurrencies can be bought and sold at a predetermined price or instantly at market rates, a stop-loss function helps to insulate traders against heavy losses.

The platform is planning to add traditional futures markets \u2014 including forex, metals, commodities and indexes \u2014 to crypto options in order to attract different groups of traders.\nOne of the goals of the new startup is to fill the gap that Digitex sees in the exchange market. The company notes that regulated exchanges offer high security, together with high fees. Smaller platforms are cheaper for traders but riskier, as they are more attractive for crypto criminals.\nFor example, in January 2019, New Zealand exchange Cryptopia was attacked, and thousands of its users lost their funds from Ethereum (ETH) wallets. The damage from the cyber theft was estimated at over $16.1 million.\nDecentralized exchanges charge lower fees and provide better security, but a lack of user adoption causes low liquidity, Digitex says. \u00a0\nThe company says they have already managed to build one of the most active communities in the industry, with more than 65,000 members in the Digitex Telegram channel. In February 2019, Digitex announced that it reached 1 million users who signed up on their waitlist and who are looking forward to Digitex\u2019s platform launch.\nThe company says that, because of the high demand for their project, they are ready to release the exchange on April 30.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nSocial media giant Facebook plans to leverage its massive user base of more than 2.7 billion for the success of its crypto project that aims to integrate Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp under one canopy.\nAccording to the New York Times\u2019 sources, the cryptocurrency will be a stablecoin that will be pegged to the fiat currencies of three nations. This project will introduce a digital currency to a massive audience and might get the users interested in this niche space, which will be positive for the other cryptocurrencies.\nWhile retail investors are skeptical about entering the crypto space due to the prolonged bear market, the institutional players are using the current low valuations across the board to invest.\nBloomberg reported that Singapore\u2019s Government Investment Corporation (GIC), with more than $100 billion in assets, was one of the investors in the Series E equity financing round of crypto exchange Coinbase. The entry of such large investors is good news for the future of the crypto space.\nAny new technology takes time to gain widespread acceptance. As the spectrum of use cases for the blockchain technology increases, they will evolve into something larger, said Christine Moy, executive director and head of the blockchain center of excellence at JPMorgan Chase.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) again took support at the downtrend line on Feb. 27, which is a positive sign. As long as the price remains above both of the moving averages, the probability of a gradual rise to $4,255 will be high.\nCurrently, the 50-day SMA is flat, but the 20-day EMA has started to trend up, and the RSI is also in the positive territory, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand in the short term.\n\nA break out of $4,255 will complete a double bottom pattern and is likely to attract short covering. The minimum target objective of this setup is $5,273.91. Therefore, we suggest traders buy the remaining position on a close (UTC time frame) above $4,255.\nFor now, the traders can retain the stops on their long positions just below the current yearly low of $3236.09.\nHowever, if the bulls fail to push the BTC/USD pair above $3,900, it can slump to the 50-day SMA, and below it to $3,355. The downtrend will resume if the price dives below the support zone of $3,236.09\u2013$3,355.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) dipped below the 20-day EMA on Feb. 27, but managed to close (UTC time frame) above it. This shows demand at lower levels. However, unless the bulls carry the price above $145 quickly, the bears will again try to break down the support.\n\nIf the ETH/USD pair breaks down of the 20-day EMA, the fall can extend to the 50-day SMA, and below it to $116.3. This is a strong support and it might hold, otherwise the fall can reach $102.49. The traders can hold the remaining long positions with the stop loss at $125.\nOn the other hand, if the price scales above $145, a rally to $167.32 will be probable. If this resistance is also crossed, the cryptocurrency will pick up momentum.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) took support close to $0.2950 on Feb. 27. This is the third time in the past five days that the bulls have held on to this level. If they succeed in pushing the price above $0.33108, it will be a bullish sign. The next level to watch on the upside is $0.40. The traders can keep the stops on the long positions below $0.27795.\n\nConversely, if the XRP/USD pair fails to break out of $0.33108, it can remain range bound between $0.27795 and $0.33108 for the next few days. The flattening moving averages and the RSI close to the midpoint point to a consolidation.\nThe trend will turn negative if the bears sink the pair below the critical support zone of $0.24508\u2013$0.27795.\nEOS/USD\nEOS is sandwiched between the 20-day EMA and $3.8723. It has to scale above the overhead resistance to pick up momentum.\nBoth of the moving averages are gradually trending up, and the RSI is in the positive zone, which shows that the path of least resistance is to the upside. Therefore, traders can keep a stop loss of $2.90 on the remaining long positions. The target objective is $4.4930, and the next one above it is $5.5.\n\nIf the bears defend the overhead resistance and plunge the EOS/USD pair below the 20-day EMA and $3.2081, the trend will turn negative. A break below the 50-day EMA can result in a dive to the critical support of $2.1733. We should get a strong directional move within the next few days.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) has found buying support at the 20-day EMA and has moved up to the overhead resistance at $47.2460. If the bulls succeed in sustaining above this resistance, a rally to $53.4, and above it to $60, will be possible. Therefore, traders can keep a stop loss of $40 on the remaining long positions.\n\nThe 20-day EMA has started to turn up, the 50-day SMA is also sloping up, and the RSI is in the positive territory, which shows that the bulls have the upper hand.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the LTC/USD pair reverses direction from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA and $40.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has held the 50-day SMA support twice in the past five days but is yet to bounce off sharply from it.\n\nIf the bulls push the price above $140, a rally to $160 will be likely. A break out of $160 will indicate bullishness that can carry the BCH/USD pair to $177, and above it to $220. Hence, the traders holding long positions can keep the stop loss at $116.\nOur bullish view will be negated if the price slips below the 50-day SMA and plummets below $105. Currently, both of the moving averages are flat and the RSI is at the midpoint, both of which point to a consolidation in the near term.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) has been trading close to the 20-day EMA for the past four days. While it is yet to break out of $0.10, the positive sign is that it has not broken down of the downtrend line.\n\nA break out of $0.10 will indicate strength that can push the price towards the overhead resistance of $0.13427050. If the sentiment across the sector turns positive, traders can attempt this trade with a stop loss of $0.08.\nNonetheless, if the XLM/USD pair turns down from the current levels and plunges below the downtrend line and the support at $0.07256747, the downtrend will resume.\nTRX/USD\nTron (TRX) has been stuck between the downtrend line and the horizontal support at $0.0230 for the past four days. The failure of the bulls to scale above the downtrend line shows a lack of demand at these levels.\n\nA break out of the downtrend line and the 50-day SMA will propel the price back to the overhead resistance of $0.02815521. A break out of this level can start a new uptrend. Hence, we shall wait for the price to sustain above the range and then suggest long positions in it.\nHowever, if the TRX/USD pair breaks down of the support at $0.0230, it can slide to $0.02113440, and below it to $0.01830000. We expect volatility to pick up in the next few days.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) is in an uptrend and is looking strong. It has bounced off the 20-day EMA and is on its way to breaking out of the overhead resistance at $12. If successful, it is likely to pick up momentum and rally to $15, and above that to $18.\nWe like the way the 20-day EMA provided a strong support. Because of that, we suggest long positions above $12, with a stop loss of $9.\n", "birthday": "2019-03-01T22:54:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-01 22:54:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 1}

There have been attempts to solve this fundamental problem, but despite technological advancements, inefficiencies have remained. Fraud has been an issue, with underperforming publishers lacking of transparency, \u00a0which means that advertisers have been unable to guarantee whether their campaigns have reached the demographics they were promised.\nAtayen Inc., a United States-based company that was founded in 2014 \u2014 and was, until recently, engaged in developing Facebook apps \u2014 \u00a0has proposed what they call an \u201coraclized\u201d distributed application that acts as an \u201cefficiency calculator\u201d for ads placed across multiple venues.\nAtayen has created a decentralized application based on the Smart Advertisement Transaction Token (SaTT), which means that the objectives of an ad are woven into a smart contract. The DApp independently measures the number of user interactions with advertising content, and as soon the goals agreed upon between the advertiser and publisher are met, the DApp releases the payment in SaTT to the publisher.\nTo achieve this, the DApp uses a plethora of external sources of data \u2014 or \u201coracles\u201d \u2014 connected to various advertising platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and others.\nTransparency in ad sales\nGauthier Bros, Atayen\u2019s co-founder, sees this app as a herald of the \u201ctransparency revolution\u201d \u00a0in online advertising. According to him, this technology may provide a common basis for calculating advertising transactions payments. Bros argues that this improvement is beneficial for advertisers as well as for publishers. He says:\n\u201cDefining a common rule of calculation and payment of advertising operations would bring transparency, security and a faster speed for payments to the advertising sector. It is about creating the constitution that governs an advertising transaction.\u201d\nAtayen\u2019s DApp is coded in the Solidity language and allows parties to set a range of conditions that trigger the release of advertising payments to the publisher. The actual transaction closure, the number of clicks, the number of views and the total financial expenses are among these parameters.\nAtayen says the technology isn\u2019t necessarily bound to stay within the digital world, though. Since it supports an unlimited number of oracles that supply information of real-world events to the DApp, the technology use can be extended to direct marketing, print, billboards and TV ads \u2014 to any ad channel that can be independently, reliably and automatically measured.\nResult-based ad purchases\nThe company sees their technology as a response to the radical change that the internet has seen during the last 10 years. Since the vast majority of traffic now circulates on sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, simply measuring clicks is no longer relevant to advertisers\u2019 bottom line, the company argues.\nBeing an enabler of a pay-per-result model for any conceivable advertising vehicle, Atayen\u2019s ad tech aims to allow publishers to charge higher, but more justifiable rates. Bros, who is also Atayen\u2019s CEO, says:", "birthday": "2019-03-03T07:29:00+00:00", "date": "2019-03-03 07:29:00", "year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": 3}

This is a bullish sign. It shows that the investor appetite for initial coin offerings (ICOs) is returning.\nThough the crypto space has been in a crushing bear market for more than a year, it has not stopped leading banks and stock market exchanges from launching new crypto services. Swiss bank Julius Baer, having about $381.6 billion in assets under management, plans to launch crypto asset services for its clients.\nIn a survey by KPMG, 48 percent of C-level executives believe that blockchain will change the way they do business in the next three years and 41 percent of participants said they are likely to use the technology. A number of such surveys have shown a growing interest in the blockchain technology by various industries.\nHowever, these changes have still not been able to gain a stamp of approval from legendary investor Warren Buffet. In a recent interview with CNBC, he said that Bitcoin was \u201ca delusion, basically.\u201d\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) has been struggling to rebound from the 20-day EMA for the past two days. This shows nervousness among buyers. A failure to move up will attract liquidation of long positions by the bulls and initiation of short positions by the bears. A breakdown below the downtrend line and the 50-day SMA can result in a drop to the critical support zone of $3,355\u2013 $3,236.09. If the digital currency drops to a new yearly low, the downtrend will resume. Therefore, traders can keep the stops on their long positions just below the current yearly low of $3236.09.\n\nConversely, if the BTC/USD pair moves up from the current level, a rally to the top of the range at $4,255 is probable. A break out of this resistance will signal a double bottom formation, which has a minimum target objective of $5,273.91. When the price sustains above $4,255, a number of traders waiting on the sidelines for a confirmation of a bottom are likely to jump onboard.\nBoth the moving averages are flat and the RSI is close to 50, which points to a range formation in the near term. Hence, the traders should wait for a breakout above $4,255 to add the remaining position.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) has stabilized at the 20-day EMA. The bulls are trying to push the prices higher but have not been able to clear $145 for the past two days. A breakout of this level will be bullish resulting in a move towards $167.32. Therefore, traders can hold the remaining long positions with a stop loss of $125.\n\nOn the contrary, a breakdown of the 20-day EMA can sink the ETH/USD pair to the 50-day SMA and below it to $116.30. Both the moving averages are flat and the RSI is in the positive zone. This points to a consolidation in the short-term until the bulls breakout of the resistance or the bears breakdown of the supports.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) bounced sharply on Feb. 25 and even managed to move above $0.33108 but it could not sustain the higher levels. The bears again pushed prices back towards the moving averages on Feb. 26.\n\nCurrently, the bulls are trying to defend the moving averages. If successful, they will again attempt to break out of $0.33108. The XRP/USD pair will pick up momentum on a close above $0.33108. The target levels to watch on the upside are $0.40.\nOn the other hand, if the price slides below the moving averages again, it can drop to the next support at $0.27795. If this level breaks, the fall can extend to the yearly low of $0.24508. Traders can protect their long positions with the stop placed just below $0.27795.\nEOS/USD\nEOS is attempting to hold and bounce off the 20-day EMA for the past three days. If successful, it will again try to break out of the overhead resistance at $3.8723. Above this level, the move can extend to $4.4930. This time, we anticipate the bulls to scale the resistance and surge towards $6. Hence, we suggest traders hold their remaining long positions with the stop loss at $2.90.\n\nThe EOS/USD pair will weaken if it declines below the 20-day EMA and the $3.2081 support zone. If this zone breaks, the next support is at the 50-day SMA. As both the moving averages are flattening out and the RSI is marginally in the positive, a consolidation for a few days is probable.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) has been holding above the 20-day EMA for the past two days but has not been able to clear the overhead resistance at $47.2460. The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is close to the midpoint. This points to a consolidation in the short-term.\n\nThe recovery will resume if the bulls push the price above $47.2460. The next level to watch on the upside is $53 and above it $60. Therefore, we suggest traders hold their remaining long positions with the stop loss at $40.\nOur view will be invalidated if the LTC/USD pair breaks down of the 20-day EMA and plunges to the 50-day SMA.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has been holding the support at the moving averages for the past two days. However, it has not been able to rise and sustain above the 20-day EMA.\n\nA breakdown of the moving averages can attract selling that can plummet the price to $105 and if this level also fails to hold, the next support is way lower at $73.50. Therefore, traders having long positions can maintain the stop loss at $116.\nOn the upside, the BCH/USD pair will pick up momentum above $160. The flat moving averages and RSI at the center indicates a range formation in the near term.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) has been trading above the downtrend line for the past two days but the price has not rebounded strongly from the support. This shows a lack of demand at the current levels.\n\nThe XLM/USD pair will show strength if the bulls push it above $0.10. After scaling above this level, it can rally to the overhead resistance of $0.13427050. If the overall sentiment remains positive, we might suggest a short-term trade in it.\nBut if the digital currency turns down from the current level and plunges below the downtrend line, it can slide $0.0750 and below it to the low of $0.07256747.\nTRX/USD\nThe daily range in Tron (TRX) has been shrinking for the past two days. The small range shows that the bulls and the bears are waiting for a clear direction before taking a decisive action.\n\nThe price is largely stuck between $0.0230 on the downside and $0.02815521 on the upside. If the bulls scale above the overhead resistance and sustain it, a new uptrend is probable. Hence, we might suggest long positions again after the TRX/USD pair breaks out of the range convincingly.\nOn the other hand, a breakdown of the $0.0230 level will attract selling that can drag the price lower to $0.02113440 and below it to $0.01830000.\nBNB/USD\nThe bulls are attempting to hold the 20-day EMA, while the bears are defending the $10\u2013$12 zone. If Binance Coin (BNB) sustains the rebound, it is likely to consolidate there.\n", "birthday": "2019-02-27T20:05:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-27 20:05:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 27}

Users can make payments in euros, and businesses can receive them as Ethers or the platform\u2019s native cryptocurrency \u2013 YPTO Coins.\u201d\nIts team says it wants to combine the benefits of traditional payment systems with the transparency and speed of cryptocurrencies and\u00a0blockchain, and claims that its platform will be \u201crevolutionary in that it will be free of fees, with the lowest exchange commissions on the market.\u201d\nA growing number of applications\nYPTOspace says that it has envisaged multiple applications for its ecosystem. While some are already functional, others are in development.\nThe first is a peer-to-peer trading service that enables users to buy and sell assets in real time through an \u201cautomated and trustless reconciliation and settlement system.\u201d It is hoped that this global exchange will offer full transparency with exchange rates, inoculate users against rapid price changes, and make it easy for newcomers to the crypto market to make purchases with confidence.\nYPTOspace is available here\nIn a bid to appeal to the e-commerce market, merchants are going to be offered \u201csmart demand and supply management along with almost instantaneous remuneration,\u201d eliminating the delays that small businesses all too often face when they are dealing with legacy payment processing companies. Back on the consumer side, the banking platform will aim to \u201cgive users the tools to manage every aspect of their financial life,\u201d \u00a0and again, this is going to be geared toward casual audiences.", "birthday": "2019-02-27T11:43:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-27 11:43:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 27}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nA bottom formation after a long bear market is not a linear process. At various intervals, we are likely to witness spurts of buying and selling as the bulls and the bears attempt to establish their supremacy. After a smart recovery from the lows, when it looked like the bears had surrendered, came the plunge on Feb. 24, that wiped off about $15 billion from the total market capitalization within a few minutes.\nSuch selling is not always based on fundamental news or events. Technical factors like profit booking near a stiff resistance and initiation of short positions by aggressive bears can bring about such a sharp fall. While we expect volatility in the bottoming process, we are keeping our focus on the positive fundamental developments. The longer the markets disregard the fundamentals, the stronger the eventual breakout will be.\nAfter Venezuela, now Russia plans to launch an oil-backed cryptocurrency. OPEC along with Russia are exploring options for settling their energy dealings in crypto instead of Petrodollars. If this happens, it will give a big boost to crypto markets. When a head of state endorses blockchain technology and recommends it to the leaders of other nations, it shows that the time of this technology has come.\nBTC/USD\nThe recovery in Bitcoin (BTC) that started from $3,355 could not scale above the critical resistance of $4,255. The bears swung into action on Feb. 25 and pushed the price back down to the 20-day EMA. The downtrend line, which had previously acted as a stiff resistance, should act as a strong support now.\nIf the price bounces from current levels, the bulls will again try to break out of $4,255. If successful, it will indicate a double bottom formation that has a pattern target of $5,273.91. The traders can protect their long positions with a stop loss just below $3,236.09.\n\nContrary to our assumption, if the bears sink the BTC/USD pair below the downtrend line, it can again correct to $3,355. If the support fails to hold up, the next support on the downside is at $3236.09, below which the downtrend will resume.\nBoth the moving averages are flat and the RSI is close to the center, which points to a consolidation in the near term. The price action of the next couple of days will give us better insight on whether lower levels are in the offering or is this just a shakeout of the weaker hands.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) took a nosedive on Feb. 24 after rising above the overhead resistance of $167.32. We hope traders booked profits on half of their long positions as we had suggested.\n\nThe decline on Feb. 24 wiped off gains of the past six days. This shows the extent of the carnage. The ETH/USD pair is trying to bounce off the critical support at $134.5. The 20-day EMA is also nearby, hence, this level assumes significance.\nA failure to hold this level will indicate weakness and will attract further selling. Below $134.50, a drop to $116.30 is probable. Therefore, traders can keep a stop loss of $125 on the remaining half position.\nWe do not want to close the position at current levels, because if the bulls succeed in defending the support, they will make another attempt to break out of $167.32.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) closed above the overhead resistance of $0.33108 on Feb. 23, thus triggering our buy recommendation. However, the very next day, the digital currency turned around and plunged below both the moving averages. It is currently attempting to hold the immediate support at $0.29282.\n\nCurrently, both the moving averages are flat and the RSI is just above the 50 level. This shows a balance between the buyers and the sellers. Traders can keep their stop loss just below $0.27795.\nIf the XRP/USD pair finds support at current levels, it will again try to break out of $0.33108. However, if it breaks down of $0.29282, it can slide to the next support at $0.27795, which should hold. If we do not find signs of buying within the next couple of days, we might suggest to close the position.\nEOS/USD\nEOS reached our target objective of $4.4930 on Feb. 23. However, it did not stay at that level and quickly turned around. The fall was sharp, as it easily broke below the support of $3.8723. We hope traders would have locked in profits on half of their long positions as we had recommended in the previous analysis.\n\nCurrently, the EOS/USD pair is trying to hold the support at the 20-day EMA, which is sloping up. If successful, it will again try to break out of $3.8723.\nHowever, if the bears breakdown of the 20-day EMA, the fall can extend to the 50-day SMA. If this support also breaks, the slide can reach the critical support at $2.1733. Therefore, traders can keep a stop loss of $2.90 on the remaining open position.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) turned around from just above $53 on Feb. 24. The fall was sharp, and the support at $47.2460 was taken out instantly. We hope the traders had trailed the stops on half of their long position closely and locked in profits as suggested by us.\n\nCurrently, the bulls are trying to hold the 20-day EMA. If successful, the LTC/USD pair will again attempt to rise above $47.2460. However, if the support gives way, the pair can dive to the 50-day SMA. If this support also breaks, the trend will turn in favor of the bears. Hence, traders can keep their stop loss on the remaining position at $40.\nBoth the moving averages are flattening out and the RSI has dipped close to 50. This increases the probability of a range formation in the short-term.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) attempted to extend its recovery on Feb. 23 but the sharp fall on Feb. 24 took it back to the moving averages.\n\nCurrently, the bulls are attempting to hold the moving averages, which are flat. The RSI is also close to 50. If the support at the moving averages holds, the pair can consolidate between $125 and $160 for a few days.\nOur view will be negated if the bears sink the BCH/USD pair below the moving averages. Such a move will result in a fall to $105. Traders who are long can hold their positions with the stop at $116.\nXLM/USD\nAfter rising above the 50-day SMA on Feb. 23, Stellar (XLM) reversed direction and plunged below the 20-day EMA on the next day. If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, it can decline to $0.0750 and below it to the low of $0.07256747. \u00a0\n\nPrevious strong resistances act as supports after they are crossed. Thus, the downtrend line is likely to act as a strong support. If the XLM/USD pair bounces off this support, it will again attempt to scale the 50-day SMA.\nBoth the moving averages are flattening out and the RSI is close to the neutral zone. Hence, we anticipate a consolidation in the next few days. As the pair is still close to its yearly lows, we shall wait for a trend reversal before proposing a trade in it.\nTRX/USD\nTron (TRX) reached the overhead resistance at $0.02815521 on Feb. 24 but turned down sharply from it. The fall triggered our suggested stop loss on long positions at $0.0230.\n\nCurrently, the bulls are again attempting to scale above the moving averages and the downtrend line. If successful, the TRX/USD pair will make another attempt to rise above the overhead resistance.\nOn the other hand, if the price breaks down and sustains below $0.02260516, it can slump to $0.02113440 and below it to $0.01830000. The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the 20-day EMA has started to turn down. This shows that the bears have the upper hand in the near term.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) is facing resistance in the zone of $10 to $12 as we have been mentioning. The price dipped back from close to $12 to just below $10 on Feb. 24. Nevertheless, we like the way the price bounced off the 20-day EMA, which shows that the bulls are buying on dips.", "birthday": "2019-02-25T21:50:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-25 21:50:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 25}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nThe fundamentals of the crypto space have been improving over the past year. These developments are not going unnoticed by the institutional players. Though they have not committed huge sums of money, they have started testing the waters.\nCrypto hedge fund Pantera Capital, which in its two previous crypto funds had managed to raise only $13 million and $25 million, has secured $130 million in funding out of the targeted $175 million. Similarly, the University of Michigan\u2019s endowment plans to increase its investment in a crypto-focused fund managed by American venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.\nLarge traditional exchanges across the world have acknowledged the growing interest of institutional players in the crypto space and are coming up with new services. While Bakkt is the most awaited launch in the United States, exchanges in Europe are also preparing to take the plunge. Eurex, a Germany-based derivatives exchange operated by Deutsche Boerse, is planning to launch futures contracts for the top three cryptocurrencies.\nWith the groundwork being laid out for the institutional investors, is it a good time to buy for the long term or is this just a dead cat bounce?\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) has been trading close to the psychological resistance of $4,000 for the past three days. Though the bulls have not been able to push prices higher, the cryptocurrency has not given up ground either, which is positive.\nThe 20-day EMA has started to slope up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, which shows that the bulls have the upper hand in the short term. However, the 50-day SMA still remains flat, which shows that the medium-term trend is yet to change.\n\nThe BTC/USD pair will face resistance close to $4,255, but if the bulls succeed in breaking out of this level, it will complete a double bottom pattern that has a target objective of $5,273.91. Hence, we might add to our existing long positions if the price sustains above $4,255. For now, the stops can be kept just below $3,236.09.\nContrary to our expectations, if the digital currency fails to rise above $4,255, it will remain range-bound between $3,236.09 and $4,255 for a few more days. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair plunges to a new yearly low.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) has been consolidating for the past three days, without giving up much ground. This shows that the buyers are in no urgency to book profits and are buying on every small dip. This increases the probability of a move to $167.32 and higher. Therefore, traders can protect half of their long position with a tight stop. If the virtual currency pierces through $167.32, it can move up to $182.99. Hence, we shall give some wiggle room to the remaining half position and keep the stop at $125.\n\nIf the ETH/USD pair fails to scale the overhead resistance, a drop to $134.50 is probable. The 20-day EMA is also close to this level, hence, we expect it to act as a strong support. Nevertheless, if the bulls fail to hold the support, the slide can extend to the 50-day SMA and below it to $118.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) traded near the overhead resistance of $0.33108 for the past two days but could not close (UTC time frame) above it.\n\nOn the downside, the XRP/USD pair is finding support at the moving averages. If the pair bounces from the current levels and breaks out of $0.33108, it is likely to rally to $0.40. Therefore, we retain the buy suggested in our previous analysis.\nOn the other hand, if the bulls fail to breakout and sustain above $0.33108, the digital currency will continue to trade inside the range of $0.27795 and $0.33108. The trend will turn negative if the price plunges below the support zone of $0.27795 and $0.24508.\nEOS/USD\nThough EOS broke out of $3.8723, it is facing selling close to $4.00. It formed an inside day candlestick pattern on Feb. 21. If the bulls succeed in scaling above $4.10, the recovery can reach $4.4930, which is likely to act as a strong resistance.\nThe 20-day EMA is trending up and the RSI is in the overbought territory, which shows that the bulls have the advantage in the short term. Traders can keep a tight stop on half of their long positions and keep a stop of $2.90 on the remaining half.\n\nContrary to our expectation, if the bears breakdown and sustain below $3.8723, the EOS/USD pair can decline to $3.2081. The 20-day EMA is also located at this level, which should act as a strong support. However, if this level also breaks down, the pair can drop to the 50-day SMA and below it to the critical support at $2.1733.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) turned down from just above $52 on Feb. 20 but found buying at the strong support of $47.2460. If it breaks out of $52.50, the recovery can extend to $56.910 and above it to $60. Therefore, traders can keep the stop loss on half position at $40 and the other half can be trailed closely to lock in the paper profits, if not done already.\n\nThough the moving averages are trending up, the RSI is showing signs of forming a negative divergence. A break below $47.2460 will find support at the 20-day EMA, below which the slide can extend to the 50-day SMA. The balance will shift in favor of bears if the LTC/USD pair breaks down of $40.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has been trading close to $141 for the past three days. Attempts to push the price away from this level in either direction have failed.\n\nA breakout of $150.52 will signal that the bulls are back in command. The levels to watch on the upside are $163 and above it $175. Hence, traders should hold their long positions with the stop loss at $116.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the BCH/USD pair turns down from the current levels and plummets below both the moving averages and $121.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) has not been able to cross the 50-day SMA over the past three days. However, it has not given up much ground either, which shows strength. It is finding buying support close to the 20-day EMA, which has flattened out. The RSI is also close to the midpoint. These point to an equilibrium between the buyers and the sellers.\n\nA breakdown of the 20-day EMA can plunge the XLM/USD pair back towards the lows. On the other hand, a breakout of the 50-day SMA can carry it to $0.13427050. \u00a0As the digital currency has been a huge underperformer, we shall wait for a trend reversal pattern to form before recommending a trade in it.\nTRX/USD\nTron (TRX) has been trading close to the $0.025 level for the past three days. The bulls are struggling to break out of the downtrend line. Presently, the flat moving averages and the RSI close to 50 shows a balance between the bulls and the bears.\n\nIf the TRX/USD pair does not scale the downtrend line within the next couple of days, the bears are likely to push it back towards the support of $0.02306493. A break of this support can result in a fall to $0.02113440 and below it to $0.01830000. Therefore, traders can keep the stop loss on their long positions at $0.0230.\nConversely, if the cryptocurrency rises above the downtrend line, it will again attempt to break out of $0.02815521. A breakout of this critical resistance will start a new uptrend that can push the price to $0.03575668 and above it to $0.0380.\nBNB/USD\nAs expected, Binance Coin (BNB) turned down from close to $12 on Feb. 20. However, the bulls bought the dip to $10. This shows that the digital currency might consolidate between $10 and $12 for a few days.\nAs both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, the probability of a breakout of the range after a few days is high. A breakout of $12 can carry it to $15 and above it to $18.", "birthday": "2019-02-22T19:42:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-22 19:42:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 22}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nAfter a prolonged downward trend, most of the major cryptocurrencies are showing gains on a weekly basis. This shows that the recovery is picking up steam.\nHowever, even after the recent rise, most tokens are still way below their lifetime highs. Cryptocurrencies will have to spend a long time forming large bases, upon which the next bull phase will be built. It is too early to call a bottom.\nA bear market is a great time for the investors to pick up the best coins at a bargain. Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit, has said that the current bear market has driven away all the speculators, leaving behind only the true crypto believers.\nThat is a bullish sign because the die-hard crypto enthusiasts buy for the long term and will not panic sell on the next 30 percent fall.\nAfter a new uptrend begins, new traders will start jumping in. The entry of institutional investors and the approval of a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) can provide a big boost to the crypto prices. Once an ETF is approved in the United States, other nations might follow suit.\nEOS/USD\nEOS has been on a roll and has emerged as the best performer among the major cryptocurrencies, rising by about 35 percent in the past seven days. The EOS community seems to have been satisfied with the assurance of block.one CEO Brendan Blumer, who has posted in the cryptocurrency\u2019s official Telegram channel that \u201cgreat things take time.\u201d\nIn his message, Blumer also said that he does not want to take what he called the short-sighted approach and push half-finished products out. Is this attitude good enough to carry the cryptocurrency higher, or is the rally about to hit a roadblock? Let\u2019s find out. \u00a0\n\nThe EOS/USD pair is attempting to rise above the overhead resistance of $3.8723. If successful, it will indicate that the markets have rejected the lower levels. Therefore, the medium-term investors can buy on a weekly close (UTC time frame) above $3.8723, and keep a stop loss below the strong support of $2.1733.\nIf the price sustains above $3.8723, it could move up to $6.8299. Although there is a minor resistance at $4.4930, we expect it to be crossed. If the momentum remains strong, the pullback could even reach $9.30.\nBoth of the moving averages are flat, and the RSI has moved up towards the midpoint. This shows that bottom formation is in progress.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels, or from $4.4930, and breaks below $1.55.\nETH/USD\nThe week saw some heated discussions among the Ethereum (ETH) community which led to Afri Schoeden, release manager at blockchain infrastructure firm Parity Technologies, quitting all Ethereum projects.\nThe United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has largely received positive comments regarding the Ethereum mechanism. Will this open the door to a regulated futures contract on Ethereum? Let\u2019s keep our fingers crossed. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe ETH/USD pair has been moving up for the past two weeks. It has risen from $103.2 to the current levels during this period. The 20-week EMA is flattening out, and the RSI is gradually climbing towards the midpoint. This shows that the bears are losing their grip.\nA breakout above $167.32 will indicate strength and confirm a bottom at $83. Therefore, traders can buy on a weekly close (UTC time frame) above $167.32 and keep a stop loss of $100. If the price fails to sustain the higher levels after the breakout and dips below the breakout level again, it will denote weakness and the positions can be closed.\nIf the cryptocurrency sustains above $167.32, it can move up to $225, and above it to $255. Traders can trail the stop loss higher as the price moves northwards.\nBCH/USD\nCoinbase will release a new wallet update over the next few weeks that will support Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Major Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange OKEx has added Bitcoin Cash support to its customer-to-customer (C2C) trading platform. Traders can now buy Bitcoin Cash with one of the five fiat currencies supported by the platform.\nWhat do the charts forecast for the next few weeks?\n\nIn the medium term, we don\u2019t see any major bullish signals yet. Although the bulls are attempting to form a higher low at $105, it will take some time before we can confirm the start of a new uptrend.\nA breakout above $239 will be the first step that will confirm that the bottom has been formed at $73.5. The 20-week EMA is also located just above $239. Hence, this is likely to act as a major hurdle. Once crossed, the BCH/USD pair will pick up momentum. The next overhead resistance is way higher, closer to $600.\nAlthough short-term traders can try to stay on the long side for some quick profits, the medium-term traders should wait for a confirmation of a bottom before buying.\nBNB/USD\nBinance launched the testnet of its new decentralized exchange, Binance DEX, on Feb. 20. With this, the company aims to offer its customers the best features of the Binance exchange in a decentralized setting.\nBinance academy has risen to the third spot on the exposure platform Product Hunt.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-in-health-insurance-more-accuracy-more-transparency-and-more-efficiency", "title": " Blockchain in Health Insurance: More Accuracy, More Transparency and More Efficiency ", "content": "The evolving relationship between blockchain tech and the health sector has already been thoroughly documented, yet something that's received less attention is the increasing role blockchains are set to have in the health insurance industry. This industry was worth over\u00a0$600 billion in 2017 in the United States alone, while calculations suggest that as much as\u00a0$375 billion is wasted every year by American insurance companies as a result of the paperwork and administrative box-ticking that comes with having a multi-payer health care system. There is, therefore, a massive opportunity for blockchain-related companies and platforms to not only claim a slice of the health-insurance pie for themselves, but to make this pie bigger by cutting down on legacy costs.\nGiven this opportunity, it's not surprising that an increasing number of companies are looking to bring blockchain-based technology to the health insurance sector. To some extent, many service providers were looking to digitize health insurance before they ever heard of blockchain, yet it's also clear that blockchain tech will bring some definite benefits to the provision of medical insurance. From streamlining claims processes to introducing greater transparency and enabling provider interoperability, blockchains are being increasingly sought by startups and established corporations alike as a means of pushing the industry forward, with many of the biggest names in health insurance already staking their futures on the new technology.\nIBM and co.\nIf there were any doubt that blockchain tech is being taken seriously by the world's biggest insurance companies, it was most likely dispelled in January, when the likes of Aetna, Anthem and Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC) announced a collaboration with IBM to build a digital ecosystem for the health care industry based on the\u00a0IBM Blockchain Platform. According to the\u00a0press release, the parties involved aim to use IBM's blockchain to help with a range of industry challenges, from making the processing of claims and payments more efficient to enabling the \"secure and frictionless\" exchange of information among insurance providers (and medical facilities). As said by Aetna CTO Claus Jensen:\n\"We are committed to improving the healthcare consumer experience and making our healthcare system work more effectively. Through the application of blockchain technology, we'll work to improve data accuracy for providers, regulators, and other stakeholders, and give our members more control over their own data.\"\nOf course, this all sounds good in writing, but the question remains as to how exactly IBM's blockchain will be used by these insurance service providers to improve their industry. According to Soroush Abbaspour, IBM's program director for blockchain for HCLS, one of the principal ways greater efficiency will be provided will be via the use of smart contracts. As he explains to Cointelegraph, such smart contracts will permit the automatic (i.e., cheaper) execution of claims and payment processes, and they'll permit greater transparency between those handling a patient's contract(s).\n\"In today\u2019s claim processing system, especially in the case of value-based contracts, most of the process for reconciliation of the claims is manual. There is no transparency and visibility between the healthcare stakeholders who are involved in the contract associated with the patient. Blockchain can work as an authoritative source of truth for contract execution and management. It can provide a secure, transparent system of record for value-based contracts, and it can bring automatic and near real-time settlement for contracts and episode-level financial positions.\"\nAs indicated by Abbaspour, the likes of Aetna and Anthem will be using IBM's distributed ledger technology to capture and validate all incoming claims\u2019 data, as well as the quality measures taken to ensure the compliance of claims.\n\"Smart contracts on blockchains can be used to implement contract terms and business rules in a trusted execution environment. The benefit of blockchain is to dramatically reduce administration costs by eliminating duplicate processing, reducing disputes, and allowing for more effective risk management through real-time visibility and provenance leading to broader adoption of value programs by providers.\"\nSmart contracts are the secret ingredient such health insurers as Aetna and HCSC have been waiting for, even if the\u00a0move toward greater\u00a0digitization in the health insurance industry had been initiated years ago. Yet, Abbaspour notes that the providers collaborating with IBM have identified more potential benefits than simply the secure and transparent automation of claims.\n\"The founding members of the utility network have identified several use cases and plan to prioritize them,\" he says. \"The prioritized list of use cases will be shared with the industry in the coming months.\"\nIndustry interest\nWhile IBM hasn't yet made these additional use cases public, the fact that blockchains offer numerous advantages is indicated by the other organizations that have been turning to them over the past few months. Back in December, another alliance \u2013 formed by the likes of Humana, Multiplan, and Optum \u2013 announced the addition of two new members, Ascension and (once again) Aetna. Together, these insurers \u00a0would begin a trial of blockchain solutions intended to solve a variety of problems common to the health insurance industry.\nChief among these problems is the inaccuracy of directory data, which provides insurers with information on medical providers, info that is obviously needed in order to accurately process claims.\u00a0According to Modern Healthcare, insurers and health care providers spend around $2.1 billion a year to keep this info updated, while the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u00a0reported last year that 52 percent of all provider locations listed in 64 online directories had at least one error in them. By introducing distributed ledgers into this equation, providers will be able to quickly and cheaply share updated location (and other) info, thereby making it likelier that claims will be processed in a timely fashion. What\u2019s more, Humana believes that using blockchain tech for this purpose would provide the best possible entry point for bringing blockchain to other areas of the industry, as explained to Cointelegraph by Kyle Culver, the lead enterprise architect at Humana:\n\"In thinking about the opportunities with blockchain, it\u2019s important to know that its value proposition is driven by network effect, meaning that the value of a blockchain-powered solution increases as the number of participants using the solution increases. Thus, at Humana, we are focusing first on the provider directory use case. Provider directories rely upon public data, so the firms creating directories don\u2019t view this activity as being competitive in nature. With the competitive risk mitigated, firms have been more willing to collaborate. There are many other similar opportunities ripe for collaboration that could improve the overall healthcare system.\u201d\n\u201cAs our first wave of blockchain-powered solutions begin to scale and as the technologies evolve, we will gain a great deal of knowledge that we can apply to work on future, more complex, use cases.\u201d\nHealth insurer interest in blockchain isn\u2019t restricted to the U.S., though. It\u2019s also been prevalent in China, where the People's Insurance Company of China\u00a0announced that it would be teaming up with VeChain and global assurance company DNV GL to digitally transform its operations. In particular, it would harness the VeChainThor enterprise platform and its smart contract capability to bring greater efficiency to data collection, processing and auditing.\nSpeaking of such benefits, George Kang \u2014 the CEO at DNV GL Business Assurance in China \u2014 said: \"The role DNV GL plays is to ensure data integrity from the business operation perspective. In conjunction with VeChainThor Platform, we will provide a robust digital trust platform to assist PICC with enhanced data management and efficient data processing.\"\nThis wasn't the first time in 2018 that Chinese companies sought to bring blockchain to health insurance. Last June, it was\u00a0announced by the Alibaba-associated tech firm ZhongAn that it was building a blockchain-based platform for insurance and that it had already entered into data-sharing agreements for automated claims and record validation with over 100 Chinese hospitals.\nSimilar indicators that health care insurers and providers are now serious about blockchain aren't hard to find: In August, the American advisory organization for insurers (the American Association of Insurance Services) revealed that it had launched an insurance database and reporting tool running on IBM's Hypderledger Fabric ledger.\nAlso in August, Singapore-based MetLife subsidiary LumenLab\u00a0began testing \"the world\u2019s first, automated insurance solution using blockchain technology,\" which will be used to offer automatic payouts to pregnant women in Singapore affected by gestational diabetes.\nIn light of such developments, it's hard to shake the suspicion that blockchain technology will become an increasingly prominent feature of the (health) insurance industry in the coming years. Because, as IBM's Soroush Abbaspour affirms, it offers effective ways of dealing with problems that have plagued the industry for years now:\n\"Blockchain technology can allow various stakeholders in the healthcare value-chain to increase transparency and streamline processes across organizations without compromising data security and integrity. Blockchain can address a range of industry challenges, including promoting efficient claims and payment processing, enabling secure and frictionless healthcare information exchanges, and maintaining current and accurate provider directories.\"\nThe inevitable challenges\nAs promising for the health insurance industry as blockchain-based platforms would appear, there are predictably a number of factors that need to be addressed before such platforms become widespread \u2014 and before insurance providers throughout the globe strengthen their systems using distributed ledger technology.\nFirst of all, there is the understandable concern over data privacy, given that the health care industry loses around\u00a0$6 billion a year as a result of security breaches. Worse still, a joint ProPublica and NPR\u00a0report from July found that insurers are covertly amassing personal data concerning their customers from a range of public and private sources, so as to calculate how much to charge in premiums.\nThis all indicates that security needs to be one of the primary concerns for the companies rolling out blockchain-based systems, while they also need to ensure that interoperability doesn't result in customer data being shared without customer consent. However, even though this is a big challenge, Soroush Abbaspour believes it's one that IBM's Blockchain Platform will help the industry overcome:\n\"As a first principle, data is owned by the parties that bring them to the network. Each party has the ability to identify who can view and access their data on the network platform. Patient data will solely be shared between parties based on patient consent and existing privacy regulations, only between the network participants. Within these constraints, the network will facilitate sharing of data so as to improve transparency and interoperability between network members and to provide more streamlined and efficient care to patients. The infrastructure is built on a HIPAA [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]-enabled environment, within the IBM Cloud, delivering the high levels of trust, security and regulatory compliance that clients can expect from IBM Cloud and its offerings in the healthcare domain.\"\nAnother, more predictable problem is that of educating the public and relevant companies of the benefits of blockchain technology, something that can really be done only by taking a risk and launching those initial few platforms that go on to directly teach people about these benefits.\n\"The current state of blockchain can be compared to where internet was in 1997,\" says Abbaspour, suggesting that it will mostly take time and continual effort to break through the all-important threshold of public awareness.\n\"The industry needs a continued effort to educate and bring awareness to all the stakeholders in the industry about how blockchain can help them to reduce health data transaction administrative costs, improve data accuracy for consumers, providers, regulators, and other stakeholders, and ultimately improve outcomes.\"", "birthday": "2019-02-21T09:55:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-21 09:55:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 21}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-and-the-city-new-york-state-as-a-tough-model-of-crypto-regulation", "title": " Blockchain and the City: New York State as a \u201cTough\u201d Model of Crypto Regulation ", "content": "Recently the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)\u00a0granted statewide virtual currency licenses to two applicants: stock trading service Robinhood and cryptocurrency ATM operator LibertyX. The state\u2019s regulatory regime, commonly known as BitLicense, imposes a set of strict disclosure and consumer-protection requirements on any business that offers cryptocurrency-related services to New York residents. Since the framework was introduced in 2015, only a handful of companies had their applications approved by the NYDFS: The elite club of BitLicense holders now\u00a0counts just 16 entities, the two newcomers included.\nThe state has also demonstrated that it keeps close tabs on those who might be in violation of the compliance procedures: In September last year, the New York state attorney general's office published a report that raised concerns over price manipulations that were possibly taking place on cryptocurrency exchanges, and referred three of them to the state\u2019s financial regulator.\nWhile many American\u00a0states strive to appeal to crypto businesses by implementing lenient policies and easing red-tape pressures on industry startups, New York has championed a regulatory approach more rigorous than that of most nation-states. Many influential figures in crypto community are cross with what they perceive as a vast governmental overreach, yet there seems to be no shortage of firms still ready to take on the pains of obtaining the license. But in the big picture, is this type of regulatory climate that exists in the world\u2019s financial capital beneficial for the crypto industry, mainstream adoption and the Empire State itself?\n\nReasons to comply\nFor any company somehow related to finance, the benefits of doing business in New York and with New York residents are obvious. The number of powerful financial institutions per square foot is staggering, the Wall Street money is just a glance away, and a consumer market of almost 20 million people is no small deal, either. This is especially true if you are a prominent player in the nascent fintech industry longing for mainstream adoption.\nNew York legislators in Albany are well aware of their jurisdiction\u2019s unique position as a major financial hub, and have been long acting accordingly. Martin Weiss, founder of Weiss Research and Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings, explained that the tendency for strict state-level regulation has a long history:\n\u201cTraditionally, Albany has been tougher than many other states in regulating \u2014 insurance, for example. They are the toughest state in regulating financial markets, too. They see themselves responsible for keeping the financial center.\u201d\nIn the case of crypto, Weiss argued, New York\u2019s centrality to the world\u2019s financial system is a powerful enough factor to overcome the logic of crypto regulation applicable to almost any other territory:\n\u201cCryptocurrencies are, in essence, borderless. Regulation, in order to catch up, would also have to be borderless, crossing not only state boundaries but also national boundaries. New York is in a unique situation because it regulates a major financial center, the largest in the world. So as long as all those corporations want to remain domiciled in New York, legislators in Albany do have a jurisdictional reach that sticks. In most places in the world, if you try to regulate cryptocurrencies, they\u2019ll just move to another jurisdiction. That is bound to happen with most of cryptocurrency institutions. But that\u2019s not the case with New York.\u201d\nVigilant New York state authorities became concerned with Bitcoin regulation fairly early: Ben Lawsky, the state\u2019s Superintendent of Financial Services, first sketched the contours of what would become BitLicense in July 2014. Regulations came\u00a0into full effect almost a year after, forcing both existing and incoming players to either comply or quit.\nBacklash\nHardly surprisingly, not everyone took the news well. During the summer of 2015, big names such as\u00a0BitFinex and\u00a0ShapeShift pulled out of the New York market; crypto exchange Kraken announced cessation of services to New York residents in a blog post that called BitLicense \u201ca creature so foul, so cruel that not even Kraken possesses the courage or strength to face its nasty, big, pointy teeth.\u201d Erik Voorhees and Jesse Powell, the bosses of ShapeShift and Kraken, respectively, remained BitLicense\u2019s staunch critics, calling for the regulation\u2019s repeal ever since.\nAside from decrying the redundancy of regulation, opponents often point out how the pace at which licenses get approved is dismally slow \u2014 it is not uncommon for a company to wait for three years to be approved, as it\u00a0happened with Genesis Global Trading. This part of the process alone can put smaller companies at a disadvantage. As Kevin Hobbs, CEO of the blockchain consultancy Vanbex Group, told Cointelegraph:\n\u201cWe believe that these strict regulations hinders cryptocurrency innovation in the Empire State. BitLicense is particularly restrictive for small companies to bear. Since only the largest companies possessing ample resources able to comply with the strict regulations. The BitLicense became effective in New York on June 24, 2015 but in the three years since then, only five crypto-related companies have been approved for a BitLicense in the state. Indeed, these one-size-fits-all regulations ultimately stifles innovation.\u201d\nPushback from the more regulation-averse flank of crypto community has also received some political support: Larry Sharpe, a Libertarian Party candidate in the 2018 New York gubernatorial election, argued that the BitLicense regime serves to entrench the incumbent\u2019s dominance in the market, and\u00a0proposed to eliminate the licensing process. His bid in the November 2018 election, however, was unsuccessful.\nMaybe it\u2019s not that bad?\nThose who are on board with the New York authorities\u2019 rigorous policies toward cryptocurrency usually speak in the language of benefits to institutional and mainstream adoption. The idea is that the robust, large-scale crypto enterprises that prove capable of complying with the licensing requirements could draw the whole ecosystem closer to the core of the incumbent financial system that New York embodies. Robinhood, the recent addition to the pool of BitLicense holders, could definitely play this role. As Sky Guo, CEO of smart contract platform Cypherium, put it:", "birthday": "2019-02-21T21:55:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-21 21:55:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 21}

Back in December, the Venezuelan bol\u00edvar witnessed its peak annual inflation rate for 2018, with this rate coming in at a dizzying 80,000 percent, according to the calculations of Steve Hanke of John Hopkins University. However, with the United States'\u00a0imposition of sanctions against Venezuela's state-owned oil company on Jan. 28, and with Juan Guaido\u00a0self-declaration as interim president of the South American nation on Jan. 23, this already dire situation has only deteriorated further. Yearly inflation has now reached around 139,000 percent, and Venezuelans have found it even more\u00a0difficult to buy basic necessities.\nCointelegraph has already shown in a\u00a02018 article how Venezuela's recent plight resulted in a surge in popularity of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, while\u00a0data from Coin Dance reveal that over 35,000 Bitcoin (worth around $127 million at today's prices) was traded for bol\u00edvar on the LocalBitcoins crypto exchange over the entire course of last year. However, even if it\u2019s only two months into 2019, the new year has brought new peaks of trading activity for Bitcoin and the Venezuelan bol\u00edvar, with the weekly LocalBitcoins totals for the first two weeks of February \u2014 2,004 and 2,454 \u2014 exceeding anything seen in any month of 2018.\n\nSource: Coin.dance\nVenezuela's increasingly fragile circumstances have therefore provided further confirmation of the strong link between imperilled economies and crypto adoption, yet this link also finds confirmation from other nations facing similar, if not quite as acute problems. Turkey, Iran, Nigeria and India have all faced economic or inflationary pressures over the past year, and a growing number of their citizens have adapted to such pressures by turning to crypto. And while their use of cryptocurrencies isn't on the level of Venezuela's, there has been a noticeable growth in recent months, indicating that the idea of using Bitcoin and other coins as alternative stores of value is gradually taking root in their societies.\nVenezuela\n\nIn the first month of 2018, some 807 Bitcoin was traded for bol\u00edvar on the LocalBitcoins exchange. In the first month of 2019, this number hit 6,347, rising to 10,805 if you happen to add the first two weeks of February (according to the most current Coin Dance data).\nGiven that the total for all of 2018 was 35,000, it's clear that Venezuela is on its way to hitting a new national record for Bitcoin trading, especially in light of how the U.S. has stepped up its economic war against the socialist government of Nicolas Maduro. The United States\u2019 most recent sanctions prevent the state-owned oil company \u2014 Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) \u2014 from accessing $7 billion in assets it holds in America, while also stopping all sales of oil to the U.S., a market worth around $11 billion a year to PDVSA.\nAs a result, the Venezuelan bol\u00edvar is likely to lose even more of its dwindling value, given that the government will have to finance more of its growing debts by printing larger quantities of the national currency. And as happened in 2018, the deepening of this crisis is on course to strengthen the reliance of Venezuelans on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In fact, as the above figures for the LocalBitcoins exchange indicate, this effect already began taking shape in January, which saw more trading activity than any other month in Venezuelan history. Yet, the effect of Venezuelan strife on cryptocurrency isn't restricted only to Bitcoin, since other coins are witnessing comparable \u2014 if not quite as pronounced \u2014 spikes in use.\nChief amongst these is Dash, which near the end of December\u00a0celebrated the 2,500th merchant in Venezuela to accept it. Back in August, it could boast of only\u00a01,000 merchants, indicating the impressive emergence it has witnessed since then. And seeing as how the count of the merchants listed on its\u00a0DiscoverDash portal reveals that the current figure is 2,605, it's apparent that it \u00a0is still rising and likely to continue rising for the foreseeable future.\nThis expansion is the product of Venezuela's unresolved economic and financial issues. However, in contrast to the possible perception that the country is ruled by a prohibitive, iron-fisted government, it would seem that the Maduro administration \u2013\u00a0in its desperation \u2013\u00a0is tentatively taking steps to facilitate and profit from the rising prominence of cryptocurrencies like Dash and Bitcoin. This has become all the more likely in light of how American sanctions are, according to certain analysts, killing off the petro, which was launched in early 2018 but which quickly suffered from a U.S. ban.\nFor example, on Feb. 9, the National Superintendency of Crypto Assets and Related Activities (SUNACRIP) published new regulations, which introduce commissions and monthly limits on remittances sent in crypto to Venezuelan residents. This commission (payable to SUNACRIP) would be a minimum of 0.25 euro ($0.28) and a maximum of 15 percent of the value of the remittance, while the monthly limit would be set at $600.\nThis move by SUNACRIP follows in the wake of the government's recent crypto bill, which\u00a0came into force on Jan. 31 and which forces all crypto exchanges and miners to apply for licenses. As with the\u00a0introduction on Jan. 9 of a law that requires people and firms operating in crypto to pay their taxes in crypto, there's no denying that it indicates a move on the government's part to harness cryptocurrencies for its own increasingly endangered ends. Nonetheless, it also serves as a message to the Venezuelan population that the government is effectively embracing its move to Bitcoin and other coins, despite the fact that the Maduro administration had\u00a0cracked down on Bitcoin mining in the past, for example.\nWhile commissions on crypto remittances might potentially have a depressive effect on the thriving Bitcoin and Dash markets in Venezuela, there are signs that Venezuelans will become increasingly able to source their own crypto without needing someone to send it to them from abroad. Toward the end of January, Venezuela\u2019s first ever crypto ATM opened in Caracas, supporting withdrawals in Bitcoin, Dash and Litecoin. This may be the only such ATM in Venezuela at the moment, but its installation shows that, despite already enjoying impressive growth in 2018, cryptocurrency is likely to enjoy further expansion in the Bolivarian Republic in 2019.\nTurkey\n\nVenezuela may be the starkest example of how financial crises can encourage cryptocurrency adoption, but it isn't the only one. One of the biggest economies to suffer an inflationary crisis in late 2018 was Turkey, where the Turkish lira hit a record low of\u00a07.24 against the U.S. dollar on Aug. 13, soon after the Trump administration\u00a0introduced higher tariffs against Turkish steel and aluminium. And even though the government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan took the remedial step of\u00a0hiking interest rates to 24 percent on Sept. 13, \u00a0the lira's inflation rate actually increased after August, when it was\u00a017.9 percent. It rose to 24.5 percent in September, to 25.2 percent in October, and has since \u201csettled\u201d to just over 20 percent.\nIn response to the devaluation of the lira, the Turkish people have shown an increased willingness to trade Bitcoin, as indicated by data from LocalBitcoins and other exchanges serving the Eurasian country. For example,\u00a0statistics provided by CryptoCompare show that the trading of Bitcoin saw a steady and overall increase in the second half of 2018, a period that also witnessed a number of noticeable spikes (particularly during the economically turbulent months of August, September and October). On May 17, daily Bitcoin volume was only 60, yet by August, this had mounted to a daily average (for that month) of approximately 255.5, with the peak for the month being 830.\nThe peak was reached on Aug. 10, just a day after Erdogan's ill-fated \u201cbuy the Turkish lira\u201d speech, which\u00a0precipitated another cliff-edge drop for the struggling currency. It was almost as though the Turkish populace (correctly) perceived the president's urges as a tacit admission that the lira was in serious trouble, so many of them went out a did something commendably rational: They dropped the lira and started buying Bitcoin (among other stores of value).\nHowever, as was noted in last year's\u00a0article on currency crises, one of the biggest distinctions between Turkey and Venezuela is that the Turkish population has access to foreign currencies. As such, there was a pronounced\u00a0jump in U.S. dollar prices at the height of the Turkish lira crisis, as Turkish traders and laypeople turned more to the world's reserve currency as a store of value than to alternative stores, such as Bitcoin. This is why the recent increases in Bitcoin trading against the Turkish lira haven't been on the scale of trading against the Venezuelan bol\u00edvar.\nNonetheless, compared to nations with comparable gross domestic product (GDP) levels, Turkey has witnessed above-average trading. Sweden, Switzerland and Mexico are 22nd, 20th and 15th for nominal GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), yet their daily trading peaks for 2019 were 32, 45 and\u00a0636, respectively. By contrast, Turkey \u2014 which the IMF pegs as the 19th-biggest economy in the world \u2014 saw a 2018 peak of\u00a0877 (on Nov. 20), underlining the extent to which an unstable national currency can drive people toward crypto.\nIndia\n\nWhile Turkey was \"one of the biggest economies to suffer an inflationary crisis in late 2018,\" it was not, in fact, the biggest. This accolade belongs to India, which \u2014 much like Turkey \u2014 was\u00a0adversely affected by American protectionism (although it also had its own\u00a0sources of difficulty, such as inflation). By September, its currency, the rupee, had become the worst-performing in Asia, losing 12 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar since the start of the year, while it continued to see pointed\u00a0falls as late as December.\nAnd as one might expect, such declines were complemented by upticks in Bitcoin trading. In the second quarter of 2018 (after the end-of-2017 bull run had calmed down), the\u00a0figures show a daily average of 18.4 BTC. By contrast, the third and fourth quarters \u2014 when the rupee crisis began setting in \u2014 saw daily averages of 28.5 and and 30.6 BTC (and data is missing for the last two weeks of December). Compared to Q2 2018, these two figures represent increases of 54.9 percent and 66.3 percent, while data for comparably sized economies show smaller increases across these two periods.\nFor instance, CryptoCompare\u00a0data for the British pound shows a decrease of 14.9 percent between Q2 and Q3 2018, and an increase of only 15.2 percent between Q2 and Q4. In other words, while there was a general, worldwide increase in the volume of Bitcoin trades over Q3 and Q4, it was more tangible in some nations than others. And for the most part, the nations where it was more tangible were those that were experiencing periods of financial turbulence and uncertainty, like India, Turkey and (especially) Venezuela.\nIran\n\nThis is also apparent in Iran's case, even if the effect is much subtler. On Nov. 4, the U.S.\u00a0introduced sanctions against Iranian shipping, banking and oil. Or rather, it reintroduced sanctions that had been removed in 2015 by the Obama administration as part of a conciliatory deal on Iran's nuclear program. These sanctions had in fact hit the Iranian economy and the Iranian rial as early as June, when the Trump administration\u00a0announced that it was withdrawing the U.S. from the aforementioned deal, and that the sanctions would kick in again after a \u201cwind-down\u201d period.\nBy September, this announcement was the biggest factor behind the rial having lost around\u00a070 percent of its value since May, with one U.S. dollar worth approximately\u00a0150,000 rials on the black market in September. In the midst of this collapse, there has been a noticeable increase in trading volumes for the BTC/rial pair, although once again the increases aren't anywhere near the level witnessed in Venezuela, largely because the rial's inflation rate sat at around\u00a0203 percent at the apex of the crisis (compared to over\u00a0112,000 percent for Venezuela), and because Iranians had access to dollars and other stores of value (e.g., gold).\nFor example, according to the data for the BTC/rial market on LocalBitcoins, the average daily volume in Q2 2018 was a modest 3.32 BTC. In Q3 2018, this rose slightly to 3.61 BTC, while in the fourth quarter of the year \u2014 when the sanctions were activated \u2014 it rose to 4.1 BTC. Coming in respectively at 8.7 percent and 23.8 percent (compared to Q2), these are only modest rises, but they're still more than can be witnessed in other nations with comparable GDP. For instance, the IMF\u00a0puts Norway at 28th for nominal GDP (and Iran at 30th), yet between Q2 and Q3 2018\u00a0trading of Norwegian krone for Bitcoin declined by 29.9 percent \u2014 while between Q2 and Q4 2018, it declined by 25.9 percent.\nNigeria\n\nOnce again, at a time when similarly sized economies are seeing stagnation or even a downturn in their Bitcoin market, a country in financial crisis is seeing an upturn. Another country that bears witness to this effect is Nigeria, which, despite not suffering from any particularly severe crisis in 2018 (and despite not being the object of American sanctions), has still had a rough economic ride recently, having only just\u00a0exited a five-year recession at the beginning of 2018. Its currency \u2014 the naira \u2014 is also expected to experience an inflation rate of\u00a013 percent in 2019, having stood at around 11 percent at the end of last year.", "birthday": "2019-02-20T12:40:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-20 12:40:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 20}

", "content": "Positive moves are being made for investor sentiment in the cryptocurrency space despite a year-long bear market.\nThis comes after $40 million was raised by cryptocurrency investment firm Morgan Creek Digital, which is headed up by its founder, Anthony Pompliano. The crypto-focused hedge fund is part of Morgan Creek Capital, which manages over $1 billion in assets.\nWhile the capital raised isn\u2019t record-breaking, the move garnered interest because a portion of the funds come from two of three benefit plans from Fairfax County\u2019s Retirement Systems (FCRS) in the state of Virginia. The news is being hailed as the first time a United States pension fund has directly invested into cryptocurrency assets.\nThe firm had initial set its fundraising target at $25 million, but a surge in interest from investors saw the cap raised to $40 million. These funds will be used in the newly launched Morgan Creek Blockchain Opportunities Fund.\nUndaunted\nAfter the lofty highs of 2017, the cryptocurrency markets have endured a humbling and ongoing price correction. As a result, investors have been far more cautious about throwing capital into the space, having been burned by the current bear market.\nConsidering this fact, the move by Morgan Creek Digital is a positive sign for the cryptocurrency ecosystem amid a testing 12 months.\nCointelegraph spoke directly to Pompliano to unpack some of the details around the fund, how it managed to seal investment from pension schemes, and the challenges of managing a crypto investment firm during trying marketing conditions.\nFirstly, working to secure funding from the Fairfax County Police and Employee\u2019s pension plans was a process that didn\u2019t happen overnight. As Pompliano told Cointelegraph, a lot of work had to be done to ensure the fund managers that the investment was the right move:\n\u201cInstitutional investors are still getting comfortable with digital assets in general. It took a lot of education and time to ensure these investment professionals understood what the pros and cons were. Additionally, the CIOs [chief investment officers] are intelligent people who have the courage to be first.\u201d\nThis seems to be the greatest hurdle for cryptocurrency investment, given the bad run in the markets and the association of volatility within the space. Patience, Pompliano suggests, is a key factor for the future of the markets:\n\u201cMore investors will gain familiarity with digital assets over time, which ultimately leads to comfort. As investors get comfortable, they\u2019ll begin investing more capital in the space.\u201d\nPerhaps the biggest victory is the fact that the digital asset fund secured investment from pension funds, which are by nature conservative, in order to ensure the provision of income for beneficiaries at retirement.\nContrary to the perception that Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, Pompliano insists that the cryptocurrency meets the criteria of an asymmetric return profile \u2014 meaning the potential upside of the investment outweighs the potential downside risk:\n\u201cBitcoin is a non-correlated asset with an asymmetric return profile. This is the holy grail for an institutional investor.\u201d\nWhen asked if the prospect of investing money into a crypto-focused fund was a daunting task, Pompliano said that the firm was well aware of the risks associated and took on a manageable amount of capital:\n\u201cWe set out to raise a $25M fund and oversubscribed it to $40M. We only took the money that we felt we could deploy in an intelligent, risk-mitigated way.\u201d\nFairfax reassure pension beneficiaries\nFollowing headlines drumming up the investment move last week, the Fairfax County Retirement Systems sent out an official statement to allay concerns of some investors on Feb. 14.\nNaturally, some people were disconcerted by the move, given the length of the bear market and perceived volatility of cryptocurrency markets over the past 12 months.\nAccording to Jeff Weiler, executive director of FCRS, the Employees\u2019 Retirement System contributed $10 million to the fund, which amounts to just 0.3 percent of the system\u2019s total assets.\nThe Police Officers Retirement System invested $11 million into the fund, which equates to 0.8 percent of that department\u2019s total assets.\nFurthermore, Weiler made it clear that the investments were not singularly focused on Bitcoin:\n\u201cAt least 85% of the Morgan Creek Blockchain Opportunities Fund will be invested in blockchain technology firms. As such, this is very similar to other private equity investments made by Fairfax\u2019s three retirement systems. No more than 15% of the funds will be invested in actual cryptocurrencies and, to-date, the Fund has no exposure to any cryptocurrencies.\u201d\nWeiler also assured beneficiaries that significant research went into the move, involving staff, board members and Morgan Creek. County attorneys and outside parties were also consulted in the drawing up of investment contracts.\nHowever, the parting shot of the release reminds people of the inherent risk of investments and the reality of the space. As Weiler explains, risk was mitigated by the actual amount of money that was invested into the fund:\n\u201cAll investments involve risk and this investment is no different. However, as they would do with any investment, Fairfax\u2019s investment team determined that the expected returns from this investment were in line with the level of risk incurred. This also played a big part in how much was invested.\u201d\nCointelegraph reached out to Weiler for further comment, who noted that some beneficiaries of the fund had raised concerns about the move, which led to the full statement released last week.\nWhen asked if he expected other governmental pension funds to look to invest in the space, Weiler replied that \u2018he had no idea\u2019.\nInterestingly, the executive director also said that the Fairfax County in-house investment team was responsible for finding the investment opportunity, as opposed to Morgan Creek approaching the department for funding.\nSetting a new precedent?\nAs reported by Cointelegraph last week, the Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC) released results of an ongoing survey that suggests that 41 percent of participating institutional investors would look to put funds into digital assets in the next five years.", "birthday": "2019-02-20T15:53:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-20 15:53:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 20}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nBillionaire investor Tim Draper believes that crypto and fiat currencies will reverse their roles in five years. According to Draper, fiat will mostly be used by criminals, while cryptocurrencies will be used for regular day-to-day transactions.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk also said that \u201ccrypto is a far better way to transfer value than pieces of paper.\" He praised the structure of Bitcoin, calling it brilliant.

In a survey of millenial traders by eToro, 43 percent of the respondents said they had less trust in the United States stock exchanges than in cryptocurrency exchanges.\nSo, is this a good time to dive into the crypto market? Let\u2019s look at the charts and try to find out.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) closed above the downtrend line on Feb. 18, triggering our buy recommendation provided in the previous analysis. We had suggested buying only 30 percent of the desired allocation to minimize our risks. The remaining amount can be added when the leading cryptocurrency scales above $4,255.\n\nIf the recovery continues, a rally to $4,255 will be likely. Above this level, the BTC/USD pair will complete a double bottom pattern which has a target objective of $5,273.91.\nConversely, if the pair turns down from the current levels, it will find support at the downtrend line, and below it at the moving averages. A breakdown of these support levels will indicate weakness and can plunge the virtual currency towards the low. The downtrend will resume below $3,236.09.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) is facing profit booking close to the psychological resistance of $150. If the bulls scale this level, a rally to $167.32 will ensue. Traders can continue to hold half of their long position with a tight stop, and keep the stop on the rest at $125.\nThe moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover, and the RSI is in the overbought territory, which is a positive sign.\n\nIf the ETH/USD pair doesn\u2019t move up within the next couple of days, a retest of the breakout level of $134.5 will be on the cards. A bounce, following a successful retest of the breakout level, would show strength and increases the probability of a rise to $167.32. However, if the bears sink the pair below $134.5, it can drop to the moving averages.\nXRP/USD\nAlthough Ripple (XRP) spiked above $0.33108, it could not close (UTC time frame) above this level. Hence, our suggested trade did not trigger.\n\nBoth of the moving averages are flat, and the RSI has entered into the positive territory. This shows that the trend is showing signs of a reversal. If the bulls sustain above $0.33108, a rally to $0.40 will be probable.\nHence, the traders can buy on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.33108 and keep a stop loss of $0.275. We shall raise the stop loss at the first available opportunity.\nOur expectation of a trend reversal will be invalidated if the bears force the price to turn down from the current levels. If that happens, the XRP/USD pair is likely to remain range bound for a few more days.\nEOS/USD\nEOS has met our first target objective of $3.8723, where it is facing selling. If the bulls don\u2019t push the price above this resistance quickly, it is likely to enter into a correction or consolidation for a few days. The traders can protect half of their long positions with a tight stop, and trail the remaining with the stop loss at $2.9.\nThe 20-day EMA has turned up and the 50-day SMA is flat. The RSI has entered into the overbought zone, which shows that the buyers have the upper hand in the near term.\n\nWe expect the bulls to scale $3.8723 and carry the EOS/USD pair to the next target objective of $4.4930.\nOn the other hand, if the bears reverse direction from the current levels and sustain below $3.2081, it will signal weakness.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) had a one-day pause at the resistance of $47.246, after which the bulls have resumed the recovery. The first level to watch on the upside is $56.910. If this level is crossed, the next target will be $60, and above it $70. The traders should trail 50 percent of the positions closely, so as to lock in the paper profits when the upward move stalls.\n\nAs the LTC/USD pair has broken out of the critical resistance after a long time, remaining long positions can be held with a slightly deeper stop loss at $40. We want to give some wiggle room to the pair to move up because the trend is changing.\nThe 20-day EMA is sloping up, and the 50-day SMA has also started to turn up. The RSI is close to the overbought zone. This clearly shows that the bulls are in command.\nOur positive view will be negated if the price turns down sharply from the current levels and plummets below both of the moving averages.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) closed (UTC time frame) above $141 on Feb. 18, triggering our buy proposed in the previous analysis.\n\nPresently, the bulls are attempting to sustain above $141 and push the price higher. If successful, the BCH/USD pair can move up to $163, and above it to $175.\nOur bullish view will be negated if the price slips below $141 and plunges below the moving averages. For now, the traders can keep their stop loss at $116. We shall try to trail the stops higher at the first available opportunity.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) has cleared the hurdles at the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line, but is currently facing resistance at the 50-day SMA. While most other major cryptocurrencies are way above their lows, Stellar is still struggling near the lows. This shows that it is an underperformer, so we are not suggesting a trade in it.\n\nA break out of the 50-day SMA will be a positive move that could carry the XLM/USD pair to $0.13427050. The 20-day EMA is flattening out, and the RSI has also risen into the positive zone. This shows that the buyers are slowly returning back in action. Still, we shall turn positive only after we find a bullish trend reversal pattern.\nConversely, if the price turns down from the 50-day SMA, it can again drop towards the recent lows.\nTRX/USD\nThe bulls are trying to push Tron (TRX) above the downtrend line. If successful, they will make another attempt to clear the critical overhead resistance at $0.02815521.\n\nIf the TRX/USD pair sustains above $0.02815521, it can move up to $0.03575668, and above it to $0.0380. If the momentum is strong, the rally can even extend to $0.040. Therefore, the traders can protect their long positions with the stop loss at $0.0230.\nHowever, if the price fails to break out of the overhead resistances, it can drop to $0.02306493, below which the decline can extend to $0.02113440.\nBNB/USD\nAlthough we had expected Binance Coin (BNB) to face some resistance in the zone of $10\u2013$12, the current momentum looks strong enough to carry the coin out of it. Both of the moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is in the overbought zone. This shows that the bulls are in command and any dip is likely to find a strong support at the 20-day EMA.\n\nAlthough $12 might act as a minor roadblock, it is likely to be scaled. The next level to watch on the upside is $15, and after it \u2014 $18.", "birthday": "2019-02-20T18:43:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-20 18:43:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 20}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/eth-futures-case-the-industrys-feedback-to-cftc-reviewed", "title": " ETH Futures Case: The Industry\u2019s Feedback to CFTC, Reviewed ", "content": "On Feb. 17, the United States Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) stopped accepting public comments regarding the Ethereum (ETH) mechanism. Previously, as 2018 was drawing to a close, the agency requested the feedback on the cryptocurrency to better understand the technology and how it compares to Bitcoin (BTC).\nThe CFTC, which oversees the futures and options market in the U.S., has long determined that Bitcoin is a commodity, and therefore falls into its regulatory purview. In December 2017, the agency allowed two major regulated exchanges \u2014 the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) \u2014 to list BTC futures on their platforms.\nNow, given that Ethereum, like Bitcoin, has been cleared of being classified as a security, the watchdog might be preparing to greenlight Ethereum futures contracts.\nAround 30 public comments were submitted in response to the CFTC\u2019s request: Coinbase, Circle and Craig Wright were among respondents\nOn Dec. 11, the CFTC announced it was seeking public comments and guidance regarding the Ethereum network. Specifically, the agency required the feedback to better understand the cryptocurrency and its underlying technology, as well as the differences and similarities between Ethereum and Bitcoin, including the \u201copportunities, challenges, and risks\u201d associated with the altcoin.\nFurther, on Dec. 17, the regulator followed up on its initial statement and published a respective Request for Information (RFI) with the Federal Register in order to collect the information. The CFTC requested public comments on 25 different questions regarding Ethereum \u2014 namely its security and market features, as well as use cases of applications based on its network. The agency also noted that it oversees the commodity futures markets as per the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), meaning that the CFTC will most likely use the comments to assess the possibility of approving Ethereum futures. The watchdog wrote:\n\u201cThe Commission is seeking public feedback in furtherance of oversight of these markets and regulatory policy development. The input from this request will advance the CFTC\u2019s mission of ensuring the integrity of the derivatives markets as well as monitoring and reducing systemic risk by enhancing legal certainty in the markets.\u201d\nMoreover, the CFTC noted that the results of the RFI will also be used by its fintech initiative dubbed LabCFTC. Founded in May 2017, LabCFTC is a dedicated hub for \u201cengagement with the fintech innovation community,\u201d aiming to examine \u201cnew regulatory fintech developments in the marketplace,\u201d as previously explained by CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo.\nFinally, the 60-day deadline was announced as well, as the document stated that comments must be sent not later than Feb. 17, 2019.\nAccording to the CFTC website, a total of 43 entries were submitted by the public before the deadline. After taking a closer look, it becomes clear that 14 of those entries are either advertisements, generally irrelevant comments or identical copies of other statements. Hence, only 29 RFI entries represent comments on Ethereum submitted by the public. Those were filed by industry participants such as Coinbase, Circle, ConsenSys and Craig Wright, among others.\nHere is the list of selected, generalized questions proposed by the CFTC, along with answers from certain crypto companies and trading associations.\nHow do the current functionalities and capabilities of Ether and the Ethereum Network compare to those of Bitcoin?\nThe Ethereum Foundation: Switzerland-based nonprofit organization comprised of global team of developers\nThe Ethereum Foundation argued that, on the Bitcoin blockchain, each account simply stores a certain amount of Bitcoin as well as \u201ca script in an ultra-minimal programming language that determines how to verify who has the right to spend these bitcoins.\u201d Ethereum, on the other hand, supports the creation of smart contracts, the foundation argued. Smart contracts, in turn, are featured in applications that are \u201cnot financial in nature but simply use the blockchain as a source of high-assurance computation and data storage.\u201d\nCircle: Goldman Sachs-backed startup focused on making instant money transfers\nCircle compared Bitcoin and Ethereum in the context of payment transactions, also explaining that, unlike Bitcoin, the Ethereum network supports additional tokens that utilize its smart contracts feature:\n\"As with bitcoin, Ether can be used to pay for transactions and can be used for payments. Unlike bitcoin, tokens on the Ethereum network can be generated using smart contracts and can be used in smart contracts and transfers.\"\nThe Futures Industry Association: international trade organization for the futures industry with around 180 corporate members\nThe Futures Industry Association (FIA) also suggested that Ethereum is generally more versatile than Bitcoin, but warned the CFTC to measure additional risks caused by this difference. The association stated:\n\"With the Ethereum Network\u2019s architecture, risk management is potentially more complicated than for Bitcoin by orders of magnitude. Whereas Bitcoin is a payment unit on a shared and distributed ledger for transactions, Ether is a unit of work on a distributed functionality tool that offers super-computing power on the Ethereum Network, in exchange for value.\u201d\nCraig Wright: leader of Bitcoin SV, nChain chief scientist and self-proclaimed \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d\nCraig Wright also reached out to the CFTC with a comment. Notably, in the introduction, he reiterated his previous claim that he is actually the original inventor of Bitcoin.\nFurther, Wright harshly criticized Ethereum while arguing that Bitcoin can also support smart contracts in theory, but that ability was allegedly damaged by its core developers:\n\"Ethereum is a poorly designed copy of bitcoin designed with the purpose of completing the promise of smart contracts and scripting that were delivered within bitcoin but which were hobbled by the core developers of bitcoin.\"\nWould transitioning ETH to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus make it more prone to manipulation?\nThe Futures Industry Association Principal Traders Group: FIA\u2019s lobby group that represents principal traders\nThe FIA\u2019s Principal Traders Group suggested that, hypothetically, if Ethereum fully migrates to the PoS model, a participant could open up multiple validator accounts on its blockchain to their benefit. However, the community will still hold enough instruments to deal with such manipulation, the trading association argued, citing Vitalik\u2019s views on the proof-of-stake design:\n\u201cIf a malicious group of validators attempted to prevent others from joining or executed a 51% attack, the community would simply coordinate a hard fork and slash the offending validators\u2019 deposits. See Vitalik\u2019s proof-of-stake design philosophy, where he addressed this issue, here.\u201d\nConsenSys: blockchain tech company led by Joseph Lubin, Ethereum co-founder\nConsenSys argued that, \u201cunder the current proof\u2011of\u2011stake plans for the Ethereum Network,\u201d the risk that someone succeeds in manipulating the Ethereum Protocol is low, and even lower than under the current proof-of-work (PoW) system:\n\u201cIn particular, any party that stakes ether to validate blocks on the Ethereum Network will have less of an ability to directly impact the network, even relative to their proportional \u2018staked wealth,\u2019 than miners on proof\u2011of\u2011work protocols relative to their proportional hash power. In fact, [...] under the Ethereum Network\u2019s planned proof\u2011of\u2011stake protocol, even if a validator controlled 1/3 of the entire ether staked in the protocol, the validator\u2019s probability of obtaining enough control to do damage is less than one in one trillion.\u201d\nCircle\nCircle also agreed that the PoS-based network is generally safer than PoW, arguing that the community would notice any suspiciously rapid increase in the token\u2019s value:\n\u201cAdditionally, there may not be enough of a given PoS-based token\u2019s supply on exchanges, so sourcing the liquidity necessary to purchase a majority of tokens may not even be possible.\u201d\nCraig Wright\nThe self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto argued that \u201cthere is no working proof of stake-model,\u201d and that \u201call proof of stake mechanisms collapse into single-user control and allow alterationrather than the creation of an immutable record.\u201d He cited his experience of testing \u201cthe equivalent a proof of stake mechanisms\u201d in 2003-2007 to support those statements.\nWhat impediments or risks exist to the reliable conversion of Ether to legal tender?\nErisX: Chicago-based, Wall Street-backed crypto exchange\nErisX noted that Ethereum owners face certain problems like price volatility and liquidity risk related to finding ready counterparties with offsetting interest when looking to cash out on their tokens, \u201cwhich is similar to other assets that are not legal tender.\u201d\nFurther, the exchange compared Ethereum to gold in the sense that it is difficult to convert both of those assets into the legal tender physically, while future contracts significantly simplify that task:\n\u201cThe efficiency that futures contracts introduce into the gold market enables gold owners to convert their assets into legal tender more efficiently and at better prices than may otherwise be available in the absence of the futures contract. Regulated futures markets can be similarly expected to benefit the Ether market.\u201d\nCoinbase: major U.S. crypto exchange\nCoinbase essentially used this question to remind the agency that most risks associated with the conversion of cryptocurrencies into legal tender exist due to the unregulated nature of the crypto market. Ideally, the exchange continued, all trading platforms must follow thorough Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) policies, among other factors.\n\u201cAs with any freely-traded asset, the price of Ether can fluctuate based on a variety of factors. The greater the percentage of volume trading on the exchanges with capabilities listed above, the more that the market price will reflect true supply and demand for the product.\u201d\nCircle\nCircle appeared more confident about the conversion of Ethereum into legal tender:\n\u201cThere are not many impediments or risks associated with converting Ether to and from legal tender. Ethereum is one of the most liquid crypto assets available on spot trading platforms, and there are numerous trading platforms that also contain fiat on-ramps, including Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Bitstamp, itBit, HBUS (Huobi), and others.\u201d\nHow would the listing or trading of derivative contracts on Ether affect the cryptocurrency itself?\nErisX\nErisX stressed that the introduction of a regulated futures contract on Ethereum \u201cwould have a positive impact on the growth and maturation of the market,\u201d adding:\n\u201cThe introduction of standardized futures contracts [...] may have the effect of making the market more accessible, at lower risk, with lower volatility, for a larger, broader diversity of actors. This includes the potential for greater liquidity, more effective price discovery, and more efficient risk transference. A higher quality market invites greater participation, which can lead to increased quality in a positive feedback loop.\u201d\nCircle", "birthday": "2019-02-20T18:21:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-20 18:21:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 20}

Instead, the company\u2019s hardware uses a deterministic algorithm to calculate the private key at the moment of a transaction. This means that the private key comes into existence for a fraction of a second and vanishes immediately afterward. This technology is meant to overcome the risk of total loss should a hardware wallet be lost, seized or stolen. \u00a0\nBitfi recommends creating a seven-word passphrase by using its Diceware method, which offers greater entropy. However, the company says that those who own its wallet have the option to memorize their passphrase. It encourages users to leave 24-word mnemonic seeds behind in favor of a seven-word alternative. Combined with no physical storage of private keys, the company argues this better protects users against attacks \u2014 as memorizing a shorter phrase eliminates the need to write down a seed, something a malicious actor could access.\nThe company says it eliminates the possibility of wallet funds being lost if a physical device is stolen by ensuring that no data is stored on the hardware itself, meaning that hacking the wallet is \u201cfruitless.\u201d This approach also offers greater protection to users in the event that their wallet is damaged or lost following natural disasters such as fires, floods or earthquakes.\nBitfi argues the practice of storing private keys on hardware wallets and connecting such devices to a computer creates an unacceptable risk of this sensitive information being obtained by hackers or malware, especially during physical attacks.\nMaking amends\nLast year, Bitfi described its hardware wallet as the \u201cworld\u2019s first unhackable device\u201d \u2014 but the company has now withdrawn this claim.\nThe company had established a bounty hunt \u2014 initially offering a $100,000 prize, but which was then raised to $250,000 \u2014 for the first person who managed to hack its device. As reported by Cointelegraph this summer, this initiative was spearheaded by infamous investor John McAfee.\nBitfi is available here\nAlthough reports began to emerge that security experts had unearthed vulnerabilities, Bitfi claimed that these breaches did not satisfy the conditions of the six-figure bounty, which required researchers to extract funds from the device \u2014 and the company then went on to create a second bounty hunt with a smaller reward of $10,000 for \u201cman-in-the-middle\u201d vulnerabilities. Both bounty programs have subsequently been closed, but the company says it will soon introduce a new program with the launch of the new DMA-2 wallet.", "birthday": "2019-02-20T19:13:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-20 19:13:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 20}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nCNBC commentator and CEO of digital currency investment firm BKCM LLC, Brian Kelly, believes that, \u201cBitcoin is about 50 percent undervalued.\u201d However, just because it is undervalued is not a good enough reason for it to move up. Kelly opines that due to extreme negative sentiment, he will not be surprised even if Bitcoin drops to $1,500.\nWhile it is difficult to predict where the current bear market will bottom out, various experts believe that the next bull run will be a strong one. Zhu Fa, the co-founder of Poolin, a Chinese-based crypto mining pool, is extremely ambitious as he expects Bitcoin to reach $738,000 during the next bull phase. However, he also warns that the next bull run might be the last.\nThough astronomical price targets look enticing, we are currently looking for fundamental developments to carry crypto prices out of the bear market. Japanese e-commerce firm Rakuten is likely to integrate crypto payments in its mobile app that will be released on March 18. If this happens, it will be a welcome step in bringing crypto closer to mass adoption. \u00a0\nThere have been a few recovery attempts in the past few months but they have not sustained. Will the current recovery signal a bottom? Let\u2019s look at the charts to find out.\nBTC/USD\nUnlike previous occasions, the tight range in Bitcoin (BTC) has resolved to the upside. Currently, the price is attempting to break out of the downtrend line, which has been a stiff resistance since the end November 2018. A break out of this resistance will indicate strength and attract buyers.\nTraders can wait for a close (UTC time frame) above the downtrend line and buy 30 percent of their desired allocation. The stop loss can be kept just below the lows at $3,200. The next level to watch on the upside is $4,255.\n\nA breakout above $4,255 will complete a double bottom pattern, that has a target objective of $5,273.91. Traders can add the remaining 70 percent position on a breakout and close above $4,255.\nContrary to our expectation, if the bears defend the overhead resistance of $4,255, the BTC/USD pair will remain range bound for a few more days. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down and plunges below $3,236.09.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) broke out of the overhead resistance at $134.50 on Feb. 17 and has soared higher. Its next target is $167.32. Traders who have long positions can trail half of their stops closely so as to protect about 75 percent of paper gains. The remaining position can be held with the stop at the breakeven. We do not recommend booking complete profits because we anticipate a move to $167.32 and higher. Hence, we will give some wiggle room for half of the positions.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is gradually sloping higher and the RSI has reached the overbought zone. This shows that the bulls are in command. The pair is in the early stage of forming an ascending triangle pattern. Our bullish view will be negated if the ETH/USD pair turns down from the current levels and plunges back below $134.50.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) has broken out of the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA, which is a positive sign. It can now move up to $0.33108. The price has stayed below $0.33108 since Jan. 10 of this year. Hence, a break out of this level signifies bullishness. Traders can enter long positions on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $0.33108. The stop loss can be kept at $0.275. The target objective of this trade is $0.40 and higher.\n\nContrary to our assumption, if the XRP/USD pair turns down from the overhead resistance, it might remain range bound for a few days. The downtrend will resume on a breakdown of critical zone of $0.27795 and $0.24508. The flattening moving averages and the RSI close to 50 point to a consolidation in the near term.\nEOS/USD\nEOS has broken out of the overhead resistance zone of $3.05\u2013$3.2081. Its next target objective is $3.8723 and above it $4.4930. The gradual up-sloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the overbought zone shows that bulls have the upper hand. Traders who are long can protect half of their positions with a tight stop and trail the rest with a stop at $2.50.\n\nWe anticipate some resistance at $3.8723 but it is likely to be scaled. The target objective on the EOS/USD pair remains at $4.4930.\nOur bullish assumption will be invalidated if the bears reverse direction sharply and push the price back below $3.2081.\nLTC/USD\nAfter inching higher for the past three days, Litecoin (LTC) finally broke out of the overhead resistance at $47.2460. If the bulls sustain the breakout, the next target is $56.910. The uptrending moving averages and the RSI close to overbought territory shows that the path of least resistance is to the upside.\n\nNonetheless, if the bulls fail to sustain above $47.2460, the traders can book partial profits on their long positions and raise the stop loss on the rest to $40. A break below this level can result in a fall to $35 and lower. The LTC/USD pair will turn bearish if it breaks down from the critical support at $27.701.\nBCH/USD\nAfter staying close to $121 for the past six days, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has started its journey northwards. It is currently facing some resistance at $141.\n\nHowever, after breaking out of $141, we expect it to pick up momentum. Therefore, traders can buy on a close (UTC time frame) above $141 and keep the stop loss below the recent lows of $116. The first level to watch on the upside is $163, above which the up move can extend to $175. The BCH/USD pair might consolidate or correct closer to $175. However, the pair has a history of vertical rallies. If the bulls pierce through $175, it will open the door for a rally to $220.\nAll our bullish expectations will be negated if the pair turns down from $141. The trend will turn negative if the bears sink the virtual currency below $103.\nTRX/USD\nThe bulls are attempting to stabilize TRON (TRX) for the past five days but are facing resistance at the 50-day SMA. The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover, which will indicate weakness. A breakdown of $0.02344160 can drag it to $0.02113440 and below it to $0.01830000.\n\nOn the other hand, if the TRX/USD pair scales above both the moving averages, it will face selling at the downtrend line and above it at $0.02815521. The pair will pick up momentum if it sustains above $0.02815521. The targets to watch on the upside are $0.0380 and above it $0.040. Traders who are long can keep their stops at $0.0230.\nXLM/USD\nFor the past three days, Stellar (XLM) had been attempting to break out of the 20-day EMA. Though unsuccessful, we liked the way it did not give up any ground. A breakout above the 20-day EMA can carry it to the downtrend line and above it to the 50-day SMA. But as the digital currency has not participated in the recent pullback, we will wait for it to form a bullish setup before suggesting a trade in it.\n\nContrary to our expectation, if the XLM/USD pair fails to scale above the overhead resistances, it will enter into a consolidation. The 20-day EMA has flattened out and RSI is also inching towards the midpoint. This points to a range formation in the short term.\nThe pair will turn negative if it plummets below the recent low of $0.07256747. Following a breakdown, the next support on the downside is at $0.05795397.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) has again risen close to the overhead resistance of $10. We anticipate strong selling in the $10\u2013$12 zone. From mid-August to mid-November, it had struggled to break out of this range on two occasions.\n", "birthday": "2019-02-18T21:40:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-18 21:40:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 18}

However, in a long bear market, it does become more prevalent among cryptocurrency investors, as possible gains from regular trading are not as fruitful. As Kyle Samani, managing partner at Multicoin Capital Management, stated to Bloomberg:\n\u201cRegardless of market conditions, staking provides returns denominated in the asset being staked. If you\u2019re going to be long, you might as well stake.\"\nStaking rewards are a byproduct of the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, first introduced by Sunny King and Scott Nadal in a white paper in 2012 for peer-to-peer cryptocurrency Peercoin (PPC).\nSince then, hundreds of cryptocurrencies have adopted a PoS consensus algorithm as a method to verify transactions.\nProof-of-stake, explained\nThe majority of cryptocurrencies use either proof-of-work (PoW) or PoS \u2014 or some iteration of it.\nPoW relies on the proof that a certain amount of work has been done to verify transactions. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum use PoW to validate transactions, although Ethereum has been making it clear that they will be moving to a PoS system, called Casper, as part of the Serenity network update expected for later in 2019.\nAt an August 2018 Blockchain at Berkeley event, hosted by the student-run organization Origin, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, stated he can\u2019t wait for all crypto networks to move away from PoW:\n\u201cI am seriously looking forward to when the cryptocurrency community basically passes away with proof-of-work.\u201d\nWith PoW, nodes (or miners) compete to verify blocks of transactions by running highly specialized and expensive processing equipment (such as Application Specific Integrated Circuits, or ASICs) to solve complex mathematical equations. The first node to solve the equation can add the next block of transactions and collect the reward, which could either be a set amount or percentage of the transaction fee. The process, also called mining, has a number of drawbacks:\nIt is highly energy intensive (the Bitcoin network consumes almost the same amount of energy as the entire country of Singapore).The high energy dependence is not only expensive but also bad for the environment in countries where nonrenewable fossil fuels (such as coal) is burned to generate electricity.Specialized mining equipment requires a significant upfront investment, which can be risky, considering that rewards are not guaranteed.With the advent of large centralized mining pools, the risk of a 51 percent attack on PoW networks is a very real threat.\nPoS, on the other hand, only requires network participants to hold a certain amount of the native cryptocurrency in a specific wallet for a certain period of time. This is called staking and doesn\u2019t call for any expensive computer equipment or massive amounts of processing power to solve complex mathematical equations.\nKey differences from POW are:\nNodes are often called \u201cvalidators\u201d rather than \u201cminers.\u201dThere\u2019s no specialized computer hardware requirement to become a node, which means the burden on power resources is drastically reduced. This is not only cheaper but also more eco-friendly.With PoS, there\u2019s no threat of centralized mining pools.A 51 percent attack would be much more expensive to carry out. In order to take control of a PoS network, an individual or entity would have to purchase 51 percent of the available tokens. Not only that but, if you owned 51 percent of the tokens, you would want to do everything in your power to see the network succeed and continue to turn a profit. That means you are less likely to do anything to defraud the blockchain.\n\nDifferent levels of PoS staking for different levels of rewards\nIt is common in PoS cryptocurrencies to award those with a bigger vested interest in the network with bigger benefits. This is both in network authority (such as voting weight) and rewards.\nAs such, cryptocurrency networks will often offer different levels of staking \u2014 i.e., the more coins you lock away for staking, the bigger the network will reward you.\nThis gives rise to two distinguishable types of staking: masternode staking and non-node staking.\nMasternode staking to validate transactions\nMasternodes are network participants that are tasked with validating and authenticating transactions on a PoS blockchain.\nTo apply for a masternode, participants will generally have to comply with some minimum requirements. This will be different from network to network but may include locking away a set number of tokens (typically a large minimum), being a network participant and holding tokens for a certain period of time, and being an active community member with a good reputation. The number of masternode positions will generally also be limited.\nRewards are distributed as part of the network fees (transaction fees) and tend to be big, as the vested interest in the network needs to be big. But the barrier to entry is also quite high \u2014 i.e., you would need a large initial investment to become a masternode.\nFor example, to become a Neo masternode (also called bookkeepers or consensus nodes), a participant will need to stake 1,000 GAS ($2,150) \u2014 the fuel token on the Neo network that represents the right to use the Neo blockchain and is used to pay the network fees for issuing new assets, running smart contracts and storage \u2014 to nominate themselves as a bookkeeper and also obtain a consensus authority certificate before Neo community members can vote for them. The Neo mainnet is limited to seven consensus nodes\nAccording to Neo\u2019s economic model, the maintainer of a Neo consensus node will be rewarded with network fees.\nSimilarly, to apply for masternode status (also called Authority Masternode) on VeChain (VET), a participant will have to stake 25 million VET ($97,500) to be considered and will have to complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification in the VeChain portal. Its masternode positions are limited to 101 members.\nVeChain masternodes are compensated in part by transaction fees and part from a predetermined foundation reward pool.\nNon-node staking to earn interest or dividends\nNon-node staking is less complicated, and users are not involved in validating transactions. There is no minimum staking amount and often no minimum holding period, meaning the barrier of entry is much lower.\nAll a network participant has to do is hold the specific cryptocurrency in the network\u2019s dedicated wallet to start earning interest or dividend payouts.\nBoth the Neo and VeChain examples above have calculators to show you how much you can earn per amount of tokens staked.", "birthday": "2019-02-19T14:28:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-19 14:28:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 19}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-winter-survivor-inside-nvidias-difficult-relationship-with-mining", "title": " Crypto Winter Survivor: Inside Nvidia\u2019s Difficult Relationship With Mining ", "content": "On Feb. 14, California-headquartered gaming and computer hardware manufacturer Nvidia reported full-year revenue gains in 2018, despite being one of the companies worst hit by the cryptocurrency market dip and subsequent lack of demand for mining components.\nThe firm\u2019s main products include graphics processing units (GPU), among others, which became widely purchased by miners during the crypto boom of 2017 \u2014 as a result, the firm\u2019s revenue started to correlate with the crypto market condition (at least to some extent), which resulted in a few shake-ups. \u00a0\n\n2017: Nvidia enjoys the crypto boom, becomes substantial part of the market\nIn 2017, its primary GPU product line, labeled \"GeForce\" \u2014 as well as its direct competition, Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) \"Radeon\" units \u2014 began surging in price as the crypto frenzy unfolded and Bitcoin (BTC), along with altcoins, gained mainstream recognition. That year, according to Jon Peddie Research, a market research firm for the computer graphics industry, miners purchased around 3 million devices for more than $700 million. As a result, Nvidia inadvertently became one of the market\u2019s most significant players.\n\nThe ever-increasing demand for mining equipment lead to higher prices: As Cointelegraph previously reported, the cost of flagship chips rose by 25 percent, with Nvidia\u2019s GeForce 1080 being sold for more than $1,000 during the market peak, while it normally retailed for $550. According to media reports, Nvidia even started limiting its online sales to avoid excessive resell, allowing customer to buy no more than two items per person.\nThe company\u2019s seniors greeted the sudden increase in sales caused by the rapid growth of an emerging market. In August 2017, while talking to MarketWatch, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang appeared notably bullish about the crypto industry:\n\u201cCrypto is here to stay, and the market will grow to be quite large. [...] It\u2019s not likely to go away any time soon. There will be more currencies to come, they will come from different nations. [...] We stay very close to the market, and understand the dynamics very well.\u201d\nIn May 2018, Nvidia shared information about its revenue from chip sales to the crypto mining market for the first time. Specifically, the manufacturer reported earning as much as $289 million from processor sales to miners. Essentially, Nvidia was growing along with the market: The firm\u2019s first-quarter crypto sales that year amounted to over 9 percent of overall revenue for the company, which stood at $3.2 billion.\n\u201cCrypto miners bought a lot of our GPUs in the quarter and it drove prices up,\u201d the company\u2019s CEO reportedly explained on the conference call, adding, however, that high prices prevented other consumers, such as gamers, from buying into the newest GeForce graphics card series.\nFirst half of 2018: Crypto market plunges, Nvidia GPUs decline in price\nHowever, by that time, Bitcoin had long entered its notorious nosedive \u2014 in January alone, the cryptocurrency lost half of its value from the $20,000 landmark high \u2014 and Huang wasn\u2019t as optimistic about the market anymore. The sales to the crypto market would likely decrease by two-thirds in Q2 2018, the company forecasted.\n\u201cIn the beginning of the year, we thought and projected crypto would be a larger contribution through the rest of the year, but at this time we consider it to be immaterial for the second half,\u201d Huang told MarketWatch at the time.\nIndeed, as Cointelegraph reported, revenue for miners had decreased, as the crypto market underwent a correction following record highs in December 2017. Hash rates were still growing, however, indicating that the mining pool continued to expand globally.\n\nIn August 2018, the hardware developer declared that crypto mining sales in Q2 were even lower than expected. Nvidia began to dismiss the once profitable market, arguing that it does not expect to make significant mining-related sales for the rest of the year. Colette Kress, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, stated:\n\u201cOur revenue outlook had anticipated cryptocurrency-specific products declining to approximately $100 million, while actual crypto-specific product revenue was $18 million. Whereas we had previously anticipated cryptocurrency to be meaningful for the year, we are now projecting no contributions going forward.\u201d\nNvidia also forecasted its third quarter revenue between $3.19 billion and $3.32 billion, lower than the figure predicted by analysts of $3.34 billion. As a result, the manufacturer\u2019s shares declined more than 5 percent.\nIn July 2018, media started to report that the price of specialized GPUs has been declining along with sinking prices in digital currency markets. Thus, according to Computerworld, in April 2018, AMD\u2019s OEM 4GB RX 580 six-pack was sold out at the price of $3,600, while in July, it was available for just $2,500. Respectively, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Founders Edition, 8GB GDDR5X PCI Express 3.0 Graphics Card was sold out at a price tag of $1,050 in April, but could be purchased for $709 around July.\n\nSecond half of 2018: ASIC\u2019s takeover, Nvidia experiences \u201ccrypto hangover\u201d\nMeanwhile, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), a special type of computer chip that is designed solely for cryptocurrency mining, had been developed for a number of cryptocurrencies, outperforming GPUs. The largest company to ride the ASIC wave was the China-based Bitmain company, which was eventually also severely hit by the bear market. Nevertheless, the outfit began selling devices that mined non-ASIC-resistant cryptocurrencies much more efficiently than GPUs, hence partially forcing Nvidia out of mining, especially within the BTC blockchain.\nNevertheless, some cryptocurrencies can still be mined only with GPUs, says Mark D\u2019Aria, founder and CEO of Bitpro, a New York-based installation and mining operation management firm:\n\u201cIt is unlikely that Bitmain can drive Nvidia *completely* off of the market \u2013 they can certainly drive Nvidia GPUs mostly out of mining certain coins, but there are many ASIC resistant coins out there, and it would be extremely beneficial for Nvidia (and AMD) if Ethereum goes through with the ProgPoW update.\u201d\nThe target markets of Nvidia and solely crypto-oriented players like Bitmain are completely different, agrees Jonathan Bertrand, president of Technologies D-Central, mining equipment provider located in Quebec, Canada:\n\u201cBitmain's performance is closely tied to the performance of cryptocurrency while Nvidia has a wide range of markets such as gaming, AI and hash functions more general, it is not only mining operations that are hashing. Nvidia cards are excellent for the vast majority of hashing operations needed in the world, far more than an ASIC that has a single use. Not to be confused, the unique use of an ASIC is very useful, but strictly in the case of Bitcoin mining.\u201d\nFurther, on Nov. 15, Nvidia released its earnings report for the Q3 of 2018. In the report, Huang revealed that the company\u2019s \u201cnear-term results reflect excess channel inventory post the cryptocurrency boom, which will be corrected.\u201d\nBasically, while the crypto frenzy increased prices for Nvidia\u2019s gaming cards, once that demand vanished, prices did not decrease quickly enough to attract customers who were waiting for more affordable cards. The CEO referred to this period as a \u201ccrypto hangover\u201d in an interview with Reuters:\n\u201cThe crypto hangover lasted longer than we expected. We thought we had done a better job managing the cryptocurrency dynamics.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s post of sales for Q3 missed expectations yet again, and the company\u2019s shares dropped another 17 percent. Around the same time, Goldman Sachs removed Nvidia from its list of stocks with the most potential for investors. \u201cWe were clearly wrong on the stock as we underestimated the magnitude of the channel inventory build in midrange gaming GPUs,\u201d its analysts explained. Thus, Wall Street\u2019s crypto-driven expectations from the hardware developer were not met.\nIn December, CNBC reported that in Q4 2018, Nvidia experienced a massive sell-off of its shares, cutting the stock price by 54 percent, which made it the worst performer in the S&P 500. Later that month, Nvidia even faced a class-action lawsuit over its losses. Specifically, the complaint filed by Schall law firm stated that \u201cthe Company made false and misleading statements to the market\u201d and \u201ctouted its ability to monitor the cryptocurrency market and make rapid changes to its business as necessary.\u201d\n2019: Weak sales are likely to continue. However, the company will carry on regardless of crypto\nIn January 2019, Nvidia updated its financial estimates for Q4 for the fiscal year of 2019, reflecting weaker forecasted sales in its gaming and data center platforms, explained by excess midrange channel inventory following the slump in crypto market. The revenue for that quarter was now expected to be at $2.20 billion, opposed to the previous projection of $2.70 billion.\n\nJensen Huang said in the press release:\n\u201cQ4 was an extraordinary, unusually turbulent, and disappointing quarter.\u201d\nIn addition to a lack of crypto-related business, Nvidia also cited \u201cdeteriorating conditions\u201d in China as a indicator of lower-than-expected revenue from gaming GPU sales in Q4.\nFinally, in February 2019, the United States hardware firm reported full-year revenue gains after publishing its Q4 earnings. According to the press release, its total 2018 revenue climbed 21 percent from 2017 numbers to $11.72 billion, even despite the crypto market crash. The growth was allegedly driven by all-time high sales of its gaming, data center, professional visualization and automotive products.\nAs a result, Nvidia\u2019s shares jumped 8 percent after the figures were unveiled. Q4 performance turned out to be extremely low, however: Revenue was down 24 percent versus the same quarter the previous year to $2.24 billion, staying just slightly above the adjusted forecast.\nCommenting on the statistics, Nvidia\u2019s CEO stressed the market\u2019s infamous volatility:", "birthday": "2019-02-19T18:23:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-19 18:23:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 19}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/ordinary-stablecoin-or-xrp-killer-what-we-know-about-jpmorgan-chases-new-cryptocurrency", "title": " Ordinary Stablecoin or XRP Killer? What We Know About JPMorgan Chase\u2019s New Cryptocurrency ", "content": "The article was updated on Feb. 20 to include a new comment.\nOn Feb. 14, United States banking behemoth JPMorgan Chase announced its own cryptocurrency. Significantly, it is the first time a major U.S. bank has tapped into digital assets for direct use in business operations.\nIt is fair to say that move comes unexpectedly for JPMorgan Chase, whose CEO, Jamie Dimon, is famous within the crypto community for his anti-Bitcoin (BTC) remarks. Here are the main outtakes from reports and comments about the new virtual currency, dubbed \u201cJPM Coin.\u201d\nJPM Coin aims to increase settlement efficiency, initially within three of its operations\nThere are three early applications for the JPM Coin, as Umar Farooq, head of the lender's blockchain projects, told CNBC.\nThe first one is cross-border payments for large corporate clients, which currently rely on wire transfers provided by networks like SWIFT, meaning that they might take up to several working days to settle. According to Farooq, payments using JPM Coin will be instantly performed at any time of day.\nAs a result, SWIFT, which currently handles more than half of all high-value, cross-border payments, might be additionally challenged to update its remittance system. The 46-year-old Belgium-based interbank messaging service has already been confronted by Ripple (XRP), whose CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, had recently declared that \u201cwhat we are doing on a day-to-day basis is in fact taking over SWIFT.\u201d Ripple has reported various advancements on the field of international payments, allegedly saving transaction costs by 40-70 percent with its xRapid platform and adding several major banking institutions to its RippleNet network. \u00a0\nSWIFT, in turn, has already started researching blockchain as one of the options to achieve quicker payments. Additionally, it has been boosting its Global Payments Innovation (GPI) payments platform \u2014 just recently, the banking network launched a proof-of-concept (PoC) of a gateway that would allow blockchain software firm R3 to connect to the GPI.\nSecondly, JPM Coin will reportedly be used for securities transactions. In April, the bank tested its Quorum Blockchain platform, along with with the National Bank of Canada and other lending sector participants. The intent was to streamline origination, settlement and interest rate payments, among other financial processes.\nSpecifically, as Reuters wrote, the trial \u201cmirrored the Canadian bank\u2019s $150 million offering on the same day of a one-year floating-rate Yankee certificate of deposit.\u201d Thus, institutional investors can use the JPM Coin for instant settlements, as opposed to waiting for a wire transfer to come through.\nJPMorgan Chase created Quorum in 2016 as part of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA), of which it is one of the founding partners. The platforms runs on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain and is modeled after the Ethereum Go client. It is currently used by pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Genentech as well as Microsoft Azure, among others. In March, JPMorgan Chase declared that they were considering making Quorum an independent entity as way to attract more partners that could be scared off if they are competitors of the bank.\nFinally, the new cryptocurrency might be employed by large corporations including Honeywell International and Facebook, which will reportedly use JPMorgan Chase's treasury services business to replace the funds they hold in various subsidiaries across the world. According to CNBC, that businesses brought the lender $9 billion in revenue in 2018. Farooq explained in a comment:\n\"Money sloshes back and forth all over the world in a large enterprise. Is there a way to ensure that a subsidiary can represent cash on the balance sheet without having to actually wire it to the unit? That way, they can consolidate their money and probably get better rates for it.\"\nThe trials for the token are set to start \u201cin a few months.\u201d However, only a small amount of the total funds involved in the three aforementioned areas would involve JPM Coin at first. In total, JPMorgan Chase moves more than $6 trillion across the world on a daily basis, according to CNBC. It is the largest bank in the country. \u00a0As Farooq told:\n\u201cPretty much every big corporation is our client, and most of the major banks in the world are too. Even if this was limited to JPM clients at the institutional level, it shouldn't hold us back.\u201d\nHe also added that, in the future, the lender\u2019s token could be used for payments on internet-connected devices if they are migrates to blockchain. Overall, the JPM representative seemed enthusiastic about the technology\u2019s perspectives at the bank.\n\u201cSo anything that currently exists in the world, as that moves onto the blockchain, this would be the payment leg for that transaction.The applications are frankly quite endless; anything where you have a distributed ledger which involves corporations or institutions can use this.\u201d\nJPM Coin resembles a stablecoin \u2014 which falls in line with a general trend\nAccording to the CNBC report, JPM Coins are pegged to U.S. dollars so that its value stays stable \u2014 technically, that makes the new token a stablecoin, at least in its initial form.\nClients will reportedly be issued the coins after depositing dollars at JPMorgan Chase. After the tokens are used for a payment or security purchase on the blockchain, the lender will allegedly destroy them and give clients an equivalent amount of fiat in return.\nOverall, stablecoins had a great year in 2018, becoming a growing trend among the market\u2019s most compliance-oriented players. For instance, Goldman Sachs-backed startup Circle launched its USD Coin (USDC) in collaboration with major U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase, and the Winklevoss twins presented their own stablecoin dubbed the Gemini dollar after receiving the regulatory green light from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).\nJPM Coin will run on Quorum, the bank\u2019s private ETH blockchain\nAccording to an FAQ released by JPM on the same day CNBC broke the news, its token will initially be powered by the aforementioned Quorum blockchain (which is permissioned, or, in other words, private), but will also become applicable to \u201call standard blockchain networks\u201d in the future.\n\u201cThe JPM Coin will be issued on Quorum Blockchain and subsequently extended to other platforms. JPM Coin will be operable on all standard Blockchain networks,\u201d the guide says.\nBased on that, Jerry Brito, executive director at Coin Center, a nonprofit research and advocacy center focused on cryptocurrencies and blockchain, told MarketWatch that JPM merely launched an in-house payments system rather than an actual cryptocurrency:\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of confusion. [...] I see folks referring to it as a cryptocurrency. It\u2019s not a cryptocurrency. A cryptocurrency is one that is open and permissionless. If you want to download it, you don\u2019t need permission, you just need some software.\u201d\nFurther, JPM Coin will eventually expand its role beyond being a stablecoin, as per the FAQ:\n\u201cOver time, JPM Coin will be extended to other major currencies. The product and technology capabilities are currency agnostic.\u201d\nAs for now, the token is designed to be used by JPM\u2019s institutional clients only.\nMichael Dowling, CEO and founder of FairX, a financial services company involved with banking and cryptocurrencies, and former chief technology officer at IBM\u2019s blockchain division, told Cointelegraph that JPM Coin is \u201cno different/better than any other stablecoin issued by a fintech rather than a bank.\u201d\nDowling argues that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s new digital asset has not been approved as a value transfer instrument by the Office of the Controller of the Currency (OCC), the bank\u2019s chief regulator. Further, he stresses that it is only usable within JPMorgan Chase's \u201clittle walled garden,\u201d and has allegedly been tested with just one client.\n\u201cMy guess is this is JPM poking the regulatory bears,\u201d Dowling added.\nThe bank\u2019s CEO, Jamie Dimon, might be anti-Bitcoin, but he is also pro-blockchain\nJPMorgan Chase became notorious among cryptocurrency participants in 2017, when its CEO, Jamie Dimon, openly called Bitcoin a \u201cfraud.\u201d In 2018, Dimon reterierted his position by saying that he doesn\u2019t \u201creally give a s---\u201d about Bitcoin.\nHowever, at the 2019 World Economic Forum in Davos, when the JPMorgan Chase CEO was asked if he took any satisfaction when the cryptocurrency plunged last year, he replied negatively and followed with positive comments about the technology that backs it.\nSpecifically, Dimon noted that he is pro-blockchain, despite the excessive hype around the technology. In his view, blockchain is a better replacement for certain online databases:\n\u201cBlockchain is a real technology \u2014 it\u2019s just a database we can all access that\u2019s kept up-to-date.\u201d\nIndeed, the banking giant has been researching blockchain since 2016, when Quorum\u2019s white paper was first published.\nThe announcement has received mixed reaction from the community\nChangpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, greeted the first U.S. banking cryptocurrency, referencing Mahatma Ghandi\u2019s \"first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win\u201d alleged quote:\nFirst they ..., then they ..., then they..., then you win!Welcome to the real world, JPM! https://t.co/RH7LwWPCSi\u2014 CZ Binance (@cz_binance) February 14, 2019\n\nCointelegraph has reached out to Ripple for an additional comment on the matter. In response, the Ripple team sent the link to the tweet of their CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who, in turn, criticized the concept of bank-issued digital coins (which he calls \u201cbank coins\u201d) and JPM Coin specifically, citing its centralized structure:\nAs predicted, banks are changing their tune on crypto. But this JPM project misses the point \u2013 introducing a closed network today is like launching AOL after Netscape\u2019s IPO. 2 years later, and bank coins still aren\u2019t the answer https://t.co/39EAiSJwAz https://t.co/e7t7iz7h21\u2014 Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) February 14, 2019\n\nNotably, two years ago, Garlinghouse wrote an article in which he argued that such projects \u2014 where bank remittances are performed using unique digital tokens \u2014 are misguided and would inevitably result in \u201can even more fragmented currency landscape than what we have today\u201d:\n\u201cIf banks of different digital asset groups want to settle trades with one another, they\u2019ll have to make markets between their unique digital assets or trade between their digital assets and a common fiat currency. What a mess!\u201d\nHowever, some community members seem more confident about JPM Coin, suggesting that the new token is capable of achieving widespread use, and hence might overtake Ripple in the future.

For a period of 40 years, the country had been administered by the U.S. as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific islands, attaining independence in 1986 under the Compact of Free Association.\n\nCurrently, the Marshall Islands uses the U.S. dollar as its official currency and is \u201chighly dependent on receiving and spending U.S. grants,\u201d totalling around $70 million each year in assistance, in accordance with the compact. Once issued, the SOV will circulate alongside the dollar, thus the Marshall Islands will have two coexisting legal tenders \u201cfor all debts, public charges, taxes and dues.\u201d\nThe Sovereign was first introduced in February 2018, when the parliament of the Marshall Islands passed a law declaring its new national digital currency set to be released through an initial coin offering (ICO), with an initial total amount of 24 million units in order to avoid inflation. Some cash raised from the ICO will purportedly go toward health care for the country\u2019s roughly 53,000 citizens who fell victim to the consequences of nuclear testing by the U.S. in the past.\nThe president of the RMI. Hilda C. Heine, said then that \u201cthis is a historic moment for our people, finally issuing and using our own currency, alongside the USD. It is another step of manifesting our national liberty.\u201d\nTo implement the SOV initiative, the RMI government partnered with Israeli fintech startup Neema. Neema CEO Barak Ben-Ezer told the press that \u201cthis cryptocurrency, the Sovereign, is completely decentralized and the government cannot control the money supply. After the [crowd sale], they don\u2019t have any control over the currency.\u201d\nPeter Dittus, chief Economist and co-founder of SOV Global and former secretary general of the Bank for International Settlements, told Cointelegraph that the decision to develop a national digital currency and not a fiat one is backed by several reasons. According to Dittus, developing countries, such as the RMI, struggle with the high costs of remittances, and having a crypto legal tender creates a situation where the solution to costly remittance is \u201cbaked into\u201d the monetary system itself. Additionally, a central bank-managed fiat currency is costly to implement and to run, wherein \u201cfor a small country the costs clearly outweigh the benefits.\u201d\nSOV\u2019s further development is challenged by the IMF and the U.S. Treasury Department\nHowever, later in September, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised doubts about the issuance of SOV, claiming that \u201cthe potential benefits from revenue gains appear considerably smaller than the potential costs arising from economic, reputational, AML [Anti-Money Laundering]/CFT [Countering the Financing of Terrorism], and governance risks.\u201d\nThe IMF further warned the Marshallese authorities against adopting of cryptocurrency, stating that it will pose risks to the country\u2019s financial integrity, as well as relationships with foreign banks. The regulator urged the RMI to reconsider issuing a cryptocurrency until the government is able to provide and implement \u201cstrong policy frameworks.\u201d\nDittus revealed that SOV will differ from most digital currencies, as it will have measures built-in to discourage misuse, outlining the need to closely cooperate with regulators, financial institutions and exchanges \u201cto ensure that Know-Your-Customer [KYC] rules are well implemented, and that AML features cannot be circumvented.\u201d This will purportedly allow the RMI to develop new capacities in governance and facilitate a wider adoption of the technology within the country.\nSpeaking about possible instability in the country\u2019s financial system caused by cryptocurrency\u2019s volatile nature, Dittus said that it is planned to establish a Bank of SOV in the RMI, which will help provide SOV-related services to the other banks, hedging the exposure and facilitating transactions. Dittus, however, added:\n\u201cOn a fundamental level, there is no guarantee of banks or the government to provide conversion between SOV and the USD at a fixed rate, thereby limiting financial instability.\u201d", "birthday": "2019-02-16T21:18:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-16 21:18:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 16}

With the latter, the cryptocurrencies purchased by customer and their private keys are stored by Coinbase. With Coinbase Wallet, in turn, users store their own crypto protected by their unique private keys. Those keys are purportedly secured with Secure Enclave and biometric authentication technology.\nInitially, Coinbase developed Toshi, an open-source, mobile-focused decentralized application (DApp) browser and Ethereum (ETH) wallet that launched in April 2017. The project was inspired by Chinese mobile payments app WeChat and had a built-in messaging support and reputation system, enabling users to rate other users and apps within the platform. According to its developers, Toshi aimed to provide financial services to people in developing countries, especially to the unbanked population. It was also allegedly the first wallet to launch crypto collectibles.\nA year later, in April 2018, Coinbase merged Toshi with its recently acquired Cipher Browser, a similar decentralized app browser and wallet for the ETH blockchain. Cipher\u2019s creator and only developer, Pete Kim, became the head of engineering at Toshi, joining Sid Coelho-Prabhu, Coinbase\u2019s product lead for the DApp project.\nIn August 2018, Toshi was rebranded to become Coinbase Wallet. The official announcement read:\n\u201cThis is not just a new name, but part of a larger effort to invest in products that will define the future of the decentralized web and make that future accessible to anyone. [...] With Coinbase Wallet, your private keys are secured using your device\u2019s Secure Enclave and biometric authentication technology.\u201d\nThus, at the time, Coinbase Wallet supported ETH and ERC-20 tokens management, airdrops, crypto collectibles trading and storage, as well as access to DApps and decentralized exchanges, among others things. According to the firm's Medium entry published at the time, Coinbase Wallet would start supporting Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) \u201cvery soon.\u201d\nIn November 2018, Coinbase Wallet added support for Ethereum Classic (ETC). In February 2019, the exchange\u2019s wallet began hosting BTC. The firm repeated that it is considering adding BCH, LTC as well as other major cryptocurrencies.\nMore about the new feature: support for Google Drive and iCloud, more cloud storage providers in the feature\nThus, on Feb. 12, Coinbase Wallet declared that its users can now back up their private keys on Google Drive and iCloud.\nIn the accompanying statement, Coinbase explained that allowing users to upload their keys to a cloud provides a safeguard against lost keys and will help them avoid losing funds should the keys be misplaced:\n\u201cThe private keys generated and stored on your mobile device are the only way to access your funds on the blockchain. Owners of \u2018user-controlled wallets\u2019 like Coinbase Wallet sometimes lose their devices or fail to backup their 12 word recovery phrase in a safe place, thus losing their funds forever.\u201d\nNow, users of Coinbase Wallet can store an encrypted copy of the recovery phrase on their cloud accounts. Coinbase notes that neither they nor the cloud services will have access to user funds, as the recovery phrase key is unlocked by a password known only to the user. The backup is reportedly encrypted with AES-256-GCM encryption, which is only accessible through the Wallet mobile app.\nCoinbase notes that, in addition to Google Drive and iCloud, they will expand support to other clouds in the future. The feature is an opt-in service that does not replace or supersede the original recovery option.\nInterestingly, the feature was rolled out against the backdrop of the QuadrigaCX case. Earlier this month, the Canadian cryptocurrency exchange filed for creditor protection after the sudden death of its founder, who was reportedly the sole executive responsible for the exchange\u2019s keys and cold wallets. Following his death, the exchange has been unable to access $145 million in digital assets it allegedly needs to remain payable.\nCommunity reaction\nThe new feature received mixed reaction among the crypto community, as some criticized the idea of storing private keys on centralized servers. \u201cYou might want to rethink this,\u201d one of the most popular replies to Coinbase\u2019s announcement on Twitter reads. \u201cI don't understand, how do you misunderstand your target audience so bad?\u201d the other one says.\nThe reaction among Reddit users seems more collected, as many users stressed that the new feature entails encryption. For example, u/CryptoNoob-17 wrote:\n\u201cAt least it's not unencrypted private keys like what blockchain.info did some time ago by sending private keys as plain text over http. If this keeps some noobs from losing their coins and telling all their friends how stupid cryptocurrency is because they lost it all, I don't see a problem.\u201d\nSo, is the new feature safe enough? Experts weigh in\nCybersecurity specialists also seem on the fence about the new feature. Taylor Monahan, the founder and CEO of MyCrypto, a noncustodial wallet, told Cointelegraph that trusting users to come up with complicated enough passwords is not a good idea:\n\u201cRegardless of the strength of the encryption, the weak link will always be the user selected password (on both their wallet AND their cloud storage account). People simply aren't capable of generating a password with enough entropy, nor do they always use unique passwords for every service.\u201d\nMonahan adds that, if hackers realize that an influx of people start using cloud servers to store their cryptocurrency, \u201cwe will undoubtedly see an increase in attacks against these cloud storage providers.\u201d She added:\n\u201cPlayers like Coinbase should not be encouraging this type of unsafe behavior. I understand the desire for a better user experience, but the worst user experience is one where people lose all their crypto assets due to theft.\u201d", "birthday": "2019-02-17T12:56:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-17 12:56:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 17}

The report notes that, as the United States dollar is expected to weaken\u00a0and more institutional investors enter the space, a visible market recovery can be expected. Fundstrat states that the current year\u2019s crypto hangover can be attributed to the waning interest in the initial coin offering (ICO) sector as well as adverse regulatory achievements.\nJPMorgan Chase Launches JPM Coin to Increase Settlement Efficiency in Three Operations\nU.S.\u00a0banking giant JPMorgan Chase announced this week that it was planning to launch its own digital asset. After previous negative comments about cryptocurrency from the bank\u2019s CEO,\u00a0Jamie Dimon, the company has released information about its new JPM Coin, which is designed to increase settlement efficiency initially within three operations: international settlements by major corporations, treasury services and securities transactions. According to the head of JPM\u2019s blockchain focus, only a small amount of the total funds involved will at first involve the JPM Coin at first.\nCrypto Miners and Investors Are Turning to Derivatives to Survive Crypto Winter\nA recent analysis by Bloomberg has found that crypto investors and miners are looking more and more toward\u00a0derivatives like options as a way of surviving the recent market downturn. According to Bloomberg, the increasing popularity of complex traditional market trading instruments is a reflection of the difficulty of weathering the current bear market. Although official statistics are scare, Bloomberg notes that miners are now becoming one of the main sellers of a type of derivative similar to a covered call option.\n\nCoinbase Wallet Users Adds Support to Backup Encrypted Keys on Google Drive, iCloud\nCoinbase Wallet users will now be able to backup their private keys on Google Drive or iCloud. According to an official announcement, Coinbase Wallet users will be able to upload their keys to the cloud as a safeguard against lost keys, which then protects against losing funds in the case that keys are misplaced. The users can also store an encrypted copy of the recovery phrase on their cloud\u00a0accounts, and Coinbase has noted that neither they nor the cloud services will have access to user funds. Expert\u00a0opinions differ on the issue of security of such backups.\nQuadrigaCX Controversy Continues as $500K Accidentally Transferred to Inaccessible Cold Wallet\nEarlier this week, it was reported that major Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX accidentally transferred nearly $500,000 in Bitcoin (BTC) to its cold wallets earlier this month. Ever since the death of its founder, Gerald Cotten, in December 2018, the exchange has been unable to access these wallets, leaving around $190 million Canadian dollars ($145 million) missing in digital assets. Also this week, evidence emerged from an old podcast that Cotten had suggested in 2014 that he kept private keys for the exchange\u2019s wallets printed out and stored in a safe deposit box.\n\nWinners and Losers\nThe crypto markets have seen an end-of-the-week calm, with Bitcoin trading at around $3,644, Ethereum at $124 and Ripple at $0.30. The total market cap is\u00a0around $121.5 billion.\nThe top three altcoin gainers of the week are UltraCoin, dietbitcoin and SegWit2x.

According to Coinbase\u2019s four-grade reward system, the bug was rated toward\u00a0critical impact, as their highest bug bounty is capped at $50,000. This is the fourth bug bounty handed out by Coinbase over the past year.\nSoftware Dev Finds Possibility for Attack Vector in Constantinople Upgrade, Buterin Denies \nEarlier this week, software developer Tim Cotten wrote on Medium about the possibility for the new smart contract creation function, dubbed Create2, to introduce a new attack vector to the platform. Cotten wrote that, since the contract with Create2 is created at an address that can be determined by different parties, it could allow the change of smart contract addresses after being deployed. In an Ethereum developers call at the end of the week, ETH co-founder Vitalik Buterin addressed the issue, noting that the new feature will not have negative security implications.\nTurkish Police Arrest 24 Suspects Over Hacking of Around $2.5 Million From Crypto Firm\nPolice in Turkey have arrested 24 people who were allegedly involved in a 13 million Turkish lira ($2.46 million) hack from an unnamed cryptocurrency-related firm in Istanbul. The city\u2019s Cybercrime Department found that the stolen money had been moved out of hacked accounts to accounts on other exchanges, with the funds denominated in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP).

CNBC\u2019s prominent commentator, who is also the founder and CEO of digital currency investment firm BKCM LLC, analyzes markets on an everyday basis and tends to be 50 percent right \u201ctrading-wise.\u201d\nWe met with Brian Kelly at the Crypto Finance Conference in Switzerland and talked about Bitcoin ETFs, the next financial crisis, and the best and worst jobs at the same time.\nCatherine Ross: The most obvious question to you is, what is 2019 going to look like for the crypto industry?\nBrian Kelly: That's a great question! The trillion dollar question. I think it's going to be better than 2018, which is a pretty low bar.\nCR: In terms of what?\nBK: As an investor, my number one concern is price. I look at the price and I say that we've seen three or four of these kind of boom-and-bust cycles in Bitcoin. If you look at the most recent two or so, we're following roughly the same path as we\u2019ve had, which means we're somewhere closer to the end. We might have another dip lower \u2014 it wouldn't surprise me at all.\nCR: Lower that $3,000? \nBK: Sure.\nIt wouldn't surprise me if it [Bitcoin\u2019s price] went to $1,500.\nCR: And you feel it's going to be short term?\nBK: I think very short term. And I think we're coming to an end. Here's the thing, the sellers that we've seen recently are almost forced sellers. Some CEOs had to raise cash because they say they \u201ccan't hold it in crypto all the time.\u201d These are signs of the end. I don't know if it [the end of the cycle] is here or it's a little bit lower, but those are the signs of the end.\nIn 2019, if I'm looking at it, the focus will be on the currency \u2014 Bitcoin, Litecoin, some of those \u2014 because we have quite a bit of geopolitical tension in the world.\nCR: And you feel it is contributing to the price?\nBK: Yes. We're starting to see some global macro players use Bitcoin as an alternative to their gold position or as a way to hedge against fiat currency fluctuations and volatility.\nCR: Using Bitcoin instead of gold?\nBK: Yeah.\nCR: But is it stable enough?\nBK: No (laughs).\nBut they're not looking for stability, right? They're looking for a safe haven that's uncorrelated to every other asset. So, for an investor and a speculator, the stability is actually not what you want.\nYou want that volatility because you're trying to get good returns. You're trying to get something that's uncorrelated to everything else. And that persists through 2019, and it starts to get to be more of a quote-unquote mainstream asset within the investment community.\n\nOne of the most anticipated events in the crypto industry is the approval of a Bitcoin ETF, which hasn\u2019t happened yet, despite the numerous attempts. Last year alone, companies and institutions like the NYSE, VanEck, SolidX, Proshares and internet entrepreneurs the Winklevoss brothers (whose first attempt in 2017 failed) all filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC), but were rejected or are awaiting a decision.\nThe most recent development on the matter is the SEC\u2019s review of a NYSE Arca\u2019s Bitcoin ETF rule change proposal on Feb. 11. The proposal suggests \u201cto list and trade shares of the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E.\u201d This might end up being positive for the market, given the latest statement from SEC Commissioner Robert J. Jackson Jr. Speaking to Washington D.C.-based publication Roll Call on Feb. 6, he said, \u201cEventually, do I think someone will satisfy the standards that we\u2019ve laid out there? I hope so, yes, and I think so.\u201d\nCR: One more very important question for you \u2014 will there be an ETF in 2019?\nBK: No shot.\nCR: I\u2019m going to put that in the headline! \u201cNo shot for an ETF in 2019,\u201d says Brian Kelly.\nBK: That\u2019s fine! I would bet against it. I don't think it\u2019s going to happen this year. There's too much unresolved that is going to take longer than a year to resolve and before the SEC gets comfortable with what's going on.\nCR: What kind of time frame are we talking about?\nBK: I think 2020 is a very good shot.\nCR: Sounds promising! But major companies, like ShapeShift and Consensys had to lay off a lot of employees recently. What does this indicate? \nBK: This is a part of the maturation process. We all got caught up in the big bubble. That being said, this is just a very natural part of the process. There are, unfortunately, some very good people that had to be laid off just because of market circumstances.\nIt doesn't feel great right now, but it will make the industry stronger.\nCR: From the trading point of view, what are the major signs or indicators of bullish and bearish markets?\nBK: You look at the bottoms and the tops.\nI can remember in November and December \u2014 and even frankly in January, a year ago \u2014 I was getting phone calls daily like \u201cHow can I get into your fund?\u201d \u201cI need to get into that.\u201d And we [at BKCM LLC] do a monthly entry and it's not something that you get into every day.\nThat was happening at the peak. At the bottom, the phone does not ring. It's the exact opposite. The euphoria that we saw last year is a mirror image of the pessimism we're seeing now. And so, what you want to look for at bottoms are extreme pessimism.\nCR: Are you\u2019re talking about technical analysis? \nBK: Sentiment, really.\nCR: And what about fundamental analysis? How does it look for the crypto industry? \nBK: It's interesting! We have a proprietary model that gives the fair value for people.\nRight now Bitcoin is about 50 percent undervalued.\nSo, you could have a significant upside. That being said, we've seen that a couple of times in the last year. We saw that in April of 2018 \u2014 a huge run in Bitcoin.\nAnd that's what I'm talking about sentiment. So, the sentiment in the market has pushed the price of Bitcoin well below what you would consider a fair value \u2014 or at least, what I would consider fair. And that's another sign that we're near a bottom.\nCR: How does analyzing crypto markets differ from analyzing traditional financial markets? \nBK: Sentiment wise, no difference. Human beings are human beings. Fear and greed, booms and busts. In terms of how people trade markets, how people react to price movements \u2014 also no difference.\nBut on the fundamental side, there is a very big difference. It's probably closer to foreign currency analysis, where you analyze supply and demand, and what's going to affect the supply and demand factors.\nIn the traditional currency world, supply and demand might be impacted by central banks. In the crypto world, the supply-demand being impacted by the miner-supply versus the investor-demand at this point in time. So, it's a little different.\nThere's a big learning curve to getting into analyzing cryptocurrencies. It's not like if you were analyzing airlines or the auto industry and you could immediately jump over and apply the same tools \u2014 these are very different tools.\nCR: And how did you start in the financial world?\nBK: I started as one of those annoying cold callers back in the 1990s. And I'd describe it as the best job on the worst job I've ever had in my life.\nCR: Can you elaborate?\nBK: It was the worst job because every day I would come into the office. I worked at Lehman Brothers [Eds: Lehman Brothers was the fourth-largest investment bank and global financial services firm in the United States. In September 2008, it filed for bankruptcy, which, many believed, started a global economic crisis]. They would hand me a stack of 700 phone numbers \u2014 I was supposed to dial two phones at once. My only job was \u2014 I wasn't allowed to pick stocks or anything like that \u2014 to connect the person on the other end with the broker.\n\nI did that all day long as a summer internship, and then I did it a little bit after I graduated. But despite it being mind-numbingly boring, it taught me a lot about sales and human interaction. It didn't teach me too much about the stock market. But it did give me a really good foundation in how people think about the stock market and investing. That's where I started.\nThen, I was an equity sales trader. Then, I started a company called MKM Partners, which is an institutional broker dealer. After that, I started a global macro fund, trading foreign currency \u2014 and that got me into the Bitcoin world.\nCR: How many times were you right in your analysis or predictions?\nBK: Generally speaking, if I'm right slightly more than 50 percent of the time, I consider that good. On a longer-term basis, trading-wise, I'm generally right about 60 percent of the time \u2014 there's some good periods and some bad periods. But it's important for people to understand that...\nIt doesn't matter how many times you're right and how many times you're wrong; it matters how much you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong.\nYou have to have that ratio right. You could be right only 30 percent of the time and still make a lot of money as long as you make three times more on your right predictions as you do on your losses.\nCR: You\u2019ve mentioned that you started at Lehman Brothers. Can I ask you how many years ago it was?\nBK: In 1991 \u2014 28 years ago. Long time!\nCR: So, 17 years before the 2008 financial crisis, right? Did you see any signs of it coming?\nBK: I wish I could say I saw that. I knew something was wrong, but I can\u2019t say that I predicted that.\nCR: Have you seen any indicators of the real estate bubble [Eds: the housing and credit bubble most analysts call the reason for the 2008 financial crisis] back then?\nBK: Without question \u2014 the real estate looked like a bubble! Not too dissimilar from what we saw with the crypto ICOs bubble. So yes, you could see the signs of trouble. The problem with seeing them is that it\u2019s very hard to predict when they're going to end.\nCR: And the real consequences, probably.\nBK: Yeah, the real cost. For me, in 2007, when Bear Stearns [Eds: the now defunct New York-based investment bank, securities trading and brokerage firm] got bailed out by the Federal Reserve, that was the first signal for me that something was very, very wrong.\nCR: Is it at all possible to predict the next financial crisis? There are a lot of headlines about the looming recession and upcoming financial crisis. Should we prepare ourselves for the worst?\nBK: I can almost guarantee you we'll head to another recession. There's never been a period of time where we don't have a recession \u2014 it's just the business cycle. You know the Federal Reserve sometimes thinks that they can short-circuit the business cycle. But eventually, you will have another recession.\nCR: It's just the way the market works, right?\nBK: Yes, but this one is going be a little different than the other ones we've had.\nCR: How so?\nBecause what we've done lately is taken all the risk off of the private balance sheets and put them onto the government balance sheets. And so that's a very different scenario. And that's very positive for crypto. If you think about what backs a fiat currency \u2014 [it\u2019s the] full faith and credit of the government.\nIf the government debts are to a point where they can't pay it, then the credit of the government is in question. You may want to look for an alternative type of currency. \nAnd so I don't know when we're going to have that [recession] \u2014 in 2016, I thought that was going to be the beginning of it.\nCR: Do you see the signs of the start of the recession right now?\nBK: There are some signs.", "birthday": "2019-02-16T21:52:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-16 21:52:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 16}

Although the net value of the deal was only $7,100, it is a welcome step.

These inflows are largely being parked in the fund\u2019s Bitcoin Investment Trust.\nA survey of 71 global institutional investors, conducted by market research company PollRight for the Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC), has shown that 19 percent of the respondents believe that cryptocurrencies will be regularly invested in and traded by 2021.\nMoreover, 41 percent of the respondents said that institutional investors will enter the ICO market in the next five years.\nThese developments confirm the growing interest of institutional investors in the crypto space. Are the top performing cryptocurrencies showing signs of bottoming out? Let\u2019s analyze the long-term charts and try to ascertain whether they are a buy or not.\nDASH/USD\nThe expense management app Spend.com added support for Dash, offering the users various new features.\nThe Dash Core Group has announced the launch of a new Dash Ventures entity, registered in the Cayman Islands. It will invest in various asset classes, reinvesting the profits back into the Dash ecosystem.\nSo, is it the right time to buy the cryptocurrency? Let\u2019s see what the charts are suggesting.\n\nThe DASH/USD pair is attempting to rise from the level of $64. Although the upward move has been sluggish, one positive thing is that the cryptocurrency is consistently gaining ground.\nThe current recovery will face resistance at $103.261, and above it at the 20-week EMA at $109. Above these levels, the pair won\u2019t meet major resistances until it reaches $175. Therefore, the traders can buy if the price sustains above $110.\nConversely, if the price turns around from the overhead resistance, a few more weeks of consolidation will be probable.\nA break of $64 will be a negative development as it can sink the pair to $56.214. If this level breaks, the downtrend will resume. Currently, with both of the moving averages sloping down and the RSI in the negative zone, the bears appear to have an advantage.\nNEO/USD\nThis week, NEO was the second-best performer among the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Although the cryptocurrency did not make any major headlines, the market participants are excited about the possible announcements during the NEO DEVCON 2019 which is taking place on Feb. 16 and 17. \u00a0\n\nThe NEO/USD pair has largely been stuck in a tight range of $5.4808\u2013$10 recently. Previously, the cryptocurrency was stuck in a range for 13 weeks, from mid-August to mid-November 2018, before a breakdown happened.\nThe current range-bound action is already 12 weeks old. So, if history repeats itself, we are likely to see either a breakout or a breakdown within the next couple of weeks.\nThe range this time is tight, so we expect the breakout to be strong. On the upside, a breakout and close above $10 will signal strength and can carry the cryptocurrency to $17.7. If that resistance is crossed, the rally can extend to $25.29.\nThe traders can stay on the long side of the trade, following the break out of the range. There is a minor resistance at the 20-week EMA, but we expect it to be crossed.\nConversely, if the bears sink the price below the support of the range at $5.4808, the downtrend will continue.\nBNB/USD\nBinance CFO Wei Zhou has said that the exchange remains profitable despite the prolonged bear market. CEO Changpeng Zhao has revealed that Binance is aiming to release a testnet version of its new decentralized exchange on Feb. 20.\nCan Binance Coin (BNB) keep outperforming the market, or is it nearing a major supply zone? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe BNB/USD pair is at the critical overhead resistance zone of $10\u2013$12. This zone has proven to be a major hurdle from mid-August to early November 2018, before a breakdown happened.\nBoth of the moving averages are flat, and the RSI is just above the midpoint. This points to a probable consolidation. If the price turns down from the current levels, it can find support at $6, and below that at $5.5.\nAt the current levels, we couldn\u2019t find any trades that would offer us a good risk to reward ratio, so we suggest traders wait for a small dip to enter long positions.\nHowever, if the bulls scale the overhead resistance zone, a rally to $18 will ensue. Short-term traders can buy following a break out of $12 and ride the momentum higher, but should keep a tight stop loss.\nEOS/USD\nEOS is attempting to make a comeback. However, can the recovery continue or will the bulls take a breather and give up some of the recent gains?\n\nThe bulls are attempting to break out of the resistance of the tight range between $2.1733 and $3.2081. If successful, the EOS/USD pair can move up to $3.8723. Although the 20-week EMA is at $3.613, we expect it to be crossed.\nThe pair will indicate strength after it sustains above $3.8723. That will confirm that the markets have rejected the lower levels. Thereafter, the traders can expect the rally to gradually carry the digital currency to $6.8299 over the medium term.\nWe suggest the medium term investors wait for the price to scale above $3.8723 before initiating any long positions.\nOn the other hand, if the bulls fail to break out of the overhead resistance, the price will extend its stay inside the range. A break below the bottom of the range at $2.1733 will indicate weakness and can result in a retest of the yearly low at $1.55. A breakdown to new yearly lows will resume the downtrend.", "birthday": "2019-02-17T19:19:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-17 19:19:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 17}

The information could become pivotal in helping recover stolen funds in future.\nThe report notes the resilience of darknet markets amid a global crackdown, identifying the trends in the way new platforms are created and run in the aftermath of previous operations being shut down.\nExchange hacks\nExchange hacks have been the most lucrative modus operandi for cyber criminals in 2018, having generated close to $1 billion in revenue. Chainalysis identified two major hacking groups that are responsible for the majority of these crimes in 2018.\nHackers waste no time cashing out stolen cryptocurrency, usually within three months after the initial attack.\nTaking a deeper dive into data, these two prominent hacking groups stole an average of $90 million per hack.\nFollowing the initial hack, stolen funds are then moved to a plethora of wallets and exchanges to cover the tracks from the initial theft. These efforts are elaborate, as hackers will move funds up to 5,000 times.\nHackers then lay low, leaving funds untouched for six weeks or more until interest in the initial theft has died down. At the right time, at least half of the stolen funds are cashed out using various conversion services within 112 days. Three-quarters of the funds are cashed out within 168 days.\nChainalysis notes differing tactics between these two hacking organisations.\nThe first prominent group is identified as a tightly controlled organization. The hackers shuffle funds around meticulously to avoid being caught by authorities. Data from a traced hack noted up to 15,000 movements of stolen funds.\nThe second organization is less thorough in their approach, biding their time before converting stolen funds to clean money. According to Chainalysis, the group will sit on funds for six to 18 months before quickly cashing out 50 percent of funds within days on a single exchange.\n\nThese distinct methods could eventually be used to identify specific hacking groups in the future. As noted, exchanges and law enforcement agencies have not had the necessary means to track hacked funds up until recently.\nMany exchanges don\u2019t have the software to identify if the funds moved onto their exchanges have been ill-gotten, and stolen funds are processed by other exchanges. As a result, $135 million worth of stolen funds has exited the system through known exchanges.\nAddressing these challenges will require a combined effort in the future. Cooperation between exchanges is a good start \u2014 as Chainalysis notes in a working case example.\nThe research company worked to identify stolen funds that had been moved to another exchange, and once these deposits were verified, the exchange was able to work with law enforcement agencies to address the problem.\nDecoding hacks is identified as the first step to actively combating this type of crime \u2014 allowing funds to then be tracked and recovered. The cryptocurrency community will need to embrace an attitude of collaboration to make this a reality.\nDarknet resilience\n2017 was a watershed year for cryptocurrencies \u2014 Bitcoin, in particular \u2014 but the rising prices led to a number of closures of darknet markets that year.\nDespite that fact, darknets quickly rearranged themselves, and their activities doubled during 2018. Chainalysis data notes transaction volumes on these platforms breaching the $600 million mark, even as cryptocurrency markets endured humbling price corrections.\nThis indicates that criminal organizations are not driven by the actual value of cryptocurrencies, it is the anonymity and convenience that drives the use of darknet markets.\nFollowing the closure of AlphaBay and Hansa, two prominent darknet platforms, activity in the space fell by 60 percent. Nevertheless, total darknet activity peaked at over $700 million in 2017.\nWhile 2018\u2019s total amount of Bitcoin being sent to darknet markets was $100 million less than the previous year, Chainalysis\u2019 data showed a gradual increase in the total daily value sent to darknet markets during the year.\nActivity on darknet markets averages around $2 million in Bitcoin every day, but the reports show that this accounts for less than 1 percent of the economic activity in Bitcoin, as the graph below illustrates.\n\nAccording to the report, Russian darknet market Hydra seems to have picked up much of the activity that used to take place on the now defunct AlphaBay. Hyrda has received over $780 million in Bitcoin, compared to AlphaBay\u2019s $690 million.\nAs this demonstrated, authorities may have worked tirelessly to shut down many of these operations, but criminals move quickly to find different platforms to carry out their activities.\nAccording to law enforcement officials, criminals are beginning to use messaging applications like Telegram and WhatsApp to facilitate these illegal transactions. This bypasses the ability of law enforcement agencies to curtail illicit transactions by shutting down a website.\nIronically, criminals and users of these markets have to take on the additional risk of trusting their counterparty in these person-to-person dealings.\nNevertheless, darknet markets and their users continue to find new ways to continue their activities, creating an endless challenge for authorities around the world.\nAnti-Money Laundering efforts\nAs criminals come up with innovative ways to steal funds from crypto users around the world, they still face a problem when it comes to laundering this money.\nMoney laundering as a whole is a murky subject, because accurate data can only be gleaned from successful prosecutions, which are then used to make estimates of money laundering statistics.\nInterestingly enough, money laundering using cryptocurrencies provides a unique opportunity to trace funds, given that transaction data is completely transparent in fully decentralized cryptocurrencies.\nTo this end, Chainalysis has provided some rough data that breaks down the laundering of cryptocurrencies around the world. The data suggests that 65 percent of stolen funds flows through exchanges, 12 percent through peer-to-peer (p2p) exchanges, and the remainder through conversion services, Bitcoin ATMs and gambling websites.\n\nA majority of illicit funds actually flow through either exchanges (65 percent) or p2p exchanges (12 percent), with the rest flowing through other conversion services such as mixing services, bitcoin ATM\u2019s and gambling sites.\nA deep dive into money laundering with crypto\nCiphertrace\u2019s 2019 report on cryptocurrency crime takes a deep dive into money-laundering efforts over the past 12 months.\nAccording to their report, in the first two quarters of 2018, nearly three times the amount of cryptocurrency was stolen during the whole of 2017. Cumulatively, over $1.7 billion was stolen: $950 million solely from exchanges, while the remaining $725 million was stolen through scams.\n\nThis substantial amount of money still needs to be cleaned, which has given birth to a plethora of money-laundering services focused on the cryptocurrency sector.\nThe first process in traditional money laundering is known as structuring \u2014 basically moving money around so that it cannot be traced to its original illicit source.\nOrdinarily, criminals would buy assets like gold bars and sell them to do this. In the crypto world, this requires bringing money into the cryptocurrency system to move it around.\nAccording to CipherTrace, this is done using mixers, tumblers and chain hopping. The more the cryptocurrency is moved around the system, the harder it is to trace its origin. Given the anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, this makes it incredibly difficult for investigators to trace funds.\nThese various money-laundering services in the crypto space take funds from users, mix them together and output the funds back to users, creating an intricate web of transactions that makes the origin of the funds difficult to identify.\nFurthermore, some of these services now separate their input and output funds. Put simply, they have a seperate account for funds brought in, and another for funds going out. This is an evolution in methodology \u2014 given that in 2016 and 2017, crypto money launderers typically kept all their funds in one pool.\nOver the last two years, that has changed. Input funds are deposited into an exchange, then moved around various exchanges before moving the funds to an output pool. This reduces transaction costs and creates international barriers between the initial input pool and eventual output pool.\nFurthermore, some criminals use cryptocurrency gambling websites to laundering money as well. By simply setting up accounts, they can move funds in and out, creating another stop in the flow of these illicit funds.\nPhishing still a threat\nWhile Chainalysis suggest that phishing attacks have become less prevalent over the last 12 months, there are a few notable instances that show that hackers are still looking to trick people into giving up their details.\nIn January 2019, users of Electrum and MyEtherWallet were warned of phishing attacks looking to dupe unsuspecting users.\nA fake Twitter account masquerading as Electrum informed users of a fake upgrade to a new software update, while some MyEtherWallet users had received a fake email that was requesting sensitive account information.\nIn December, some Electrum users lost nearly $1 million in BTC in an ongoing phishing hack that fooled users into downloading a fake version of the wallet, with users subsequently and unknowingly providing password information.\nCryptocurrency exchange LocalBitcoins also fell prey to a phishing scam attack last month, when a hacker noted a vulnerability in the LocalBitcoins forum and lined it to a phishing address.\nAn international police operation also arrested a hacker in January, who is believed to have used a phishing attack to steal $11 million worth of Iota tokens since January 2018.", "birthday": "2019-02-18T14:23:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-18 14:23:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 18}

", "content": "Last week, the CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) said that the firm\u2019s digital asset platform, Bakkt, is expected to launch later in 2019. It is time to look deeper into the project, and see what it can bring to the crypto industry.\nWhat is Bakkt exactly?\nBakkt (pronounced \u201cbacked,\u201d referring to \u201casset-backed securities\u201d) is a digital assets platform created by ICE, the Atlanta-based operator of 23 major international exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which is by far the world's largest exchange, trading nearly 1.5 billion shares a day.\nIt was first announced on Aug. 3, 2018, when ICE revealed its plans to create a platform \u201cthat enables consumers and institutions to buy, sell, store and spend digital assets on a seamless global network\u201d via a press release. Essentially, the company intends to form a federally regulated market for Bitcoin (BTC) with a focus on institutional investment, as Kelly Loeffler, ICE\u2019s head of digital assets, who is also CEO of Bakkt, explained:\n\u201cBakkt is designed to serve as a scalable on-ramp for institutional, merchant, and consumer participation in digital assets by promoting greater efficiency, security, and utility. [...] We are collaborating to build an open platform that helps unlock the transformative potential of digital assets across global markets and commerce.\u201d\nThe list of Bakkt\u2019s investment partners famously includes Microsoft, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), and Starbucks, along with an array of Wall Street players such as Fortress Investment Group (FIG), Eagle Seven, Susquehanna International Group (SIG), Galaxy Digital, Horizons Ventures and Pantera Capital.\nThe concept of Bakkt was being developed for five years, as its both co-founders, Loeffler and her husband Jeff Sprecher, who is also the founder, chairman and CEO of ICE, told Fortune magazine. \u201cThe factory\u201d that powers the platform was being prepared \u201cin the strictest secrecy\u201d for 14 months prior to the August announcement, they added.\nIt should not be surprising that Bakkt is entering the market during the bear\u2019s reign, given that Loeffler believes that BTC\u2019s price should not be its only metric:\n\u201cNotably, 2018 was the most active year for crypto in its brief ten-year history. This was evidenced by rising investment in distributed ledger technology and digital assets, as well as by blockchain network metrics such as daily bitcoin transaction value and active addresses. Yet, these milestones tend to be overshadowed by the more narrow focus on bitcoin\u2019s price, which has been seen by some, as a proxy for the potential of the technology.\u201d\nEyal Shani, who is a blockchain researcher at a consulting group Aykesubir, agrees with that statement:\n\u201cThe value of Bitcoin or any other currency is far from being the most important measure to the health of the ecosystem.\u201d\nAccording to Shani, the arrival of a fully centralized marketplace would barely make any contribution to the long-term health of the market, although the project should indeed be appealing to Wall Street investors, especially the ones who are already familiar with cryptocurrencies:\n\u201cInstitutional investors who are strongly considering crypto would probably feel more comfortable with investing via Bakkt or other major banks. However, the entrance of ICE to this market will not change the volatility of the coin markets. At the end of the day, investing in digital currencies is investing in the likelihood the nodes and use will still be there in the long term, and no one knows how to answer that nowadays.\u201d\nPrashanth Swaminathan, founder and CEO of XDAT, a recently launched Malta-based crypto exchange, believes that Bakkt's arrival will bring more confidence into the crypto space due to its mainstream appeal. However, he also doubts that it will turn out to be a game changer in the long run:\n\u201cInstitutional investors will still be wary of the space until they see regulations coming in. Therefore, I don\u2019t expect a massive influx of institutional investment just yet. Institutional investors also need to see returns, and the best metric to gauge such returns is mass adoption (or demand-supply), as wider adoption implies less concentration of Bitcoin in fewer wallets hence lower volatility, and more likelihood of tangible utility for crypto with users using them for transactions.\u201d\n\u201cThe real game changer in the industry will be mass retail adoption rather than institutional investors' adoption.\u201d\nHere are the main features that Bakkt has announced:\nPhysical Bitcoin futures\nBakkt plans to debut physical BTC futures contracts on its platform. In short, futures represent an agreement to buy or sell an asset on a specific future date at a specific price \u2014 and hence represent a risk management tool that might be particularly important in volatile markets such as crypto. It is not an entirely new concept for virtual currencies, however \u2014 BTC futures have been traded on two major United States regulated exchanges, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), since December 2017.\nHowever, both CME and CBOE\u2019s offers are settled in cash, while the new ICE-backed platform aims to launch physical one-day BTC futures contracts. Essentially, that means that when the contracts expire on Bakkt, customers will receive BTC tokens as opposed to cash. As Loeffler told the Wall Street Journal:\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to have cash-settled, but there\u2019s a need for physical delivery.\u201d\nSwaminathan argues that such offering would be \u201cideal\u201d for dealing with BTC\u2019s infamous volatility:\n\u201cThis is ideal for price stability in a nascent asset class such as Bitcoin. Both physical and cash delivery can co-exist as we have in other commodities such as oil and it shows improving maturity in the market.\u201d\nNevertheless, Swaminathan told Cointelegraph it is important to note that, technically, Bakkt\u2019s clients will not own their BTC and that the platform gets the ability to withhold a significant proportion of the circulating supply in its custody:\n\u201cThe short term impact of this could be a price surge due to lower supply in wider market, but in the long term it could be a negative as you will want bitcoin to be more widely adopted and show its utility in payments and transactions.\u201d\nShani finds the physical delivery of the futures to be particularly useful for the development of BTC-based economies:\n\u201cIn that case businesses and individuals living both in the Bitcoin and non-Bitcoin economies could actually hedge their risk and get actual Bitcoin they need for their daily expenses. Without this ability, the futures would most likely be another tools in speculators financial games. At the same time, while I\u2019m not aware of the exact numbers, it seems that even with traditional financial instruments, we usually see very little use of the right to exercise it.\u201d\nOne-day futures contracts imply that trades are performed in a single day. Thus, according to Bakkt\u2019s plan, BTC futures would be sold throughout the trading day. Once the market closes, the ICE clearing house \u2014 which is an intermediary between the buyer and the seller \u2014 arranges to transfer the cash from the buyer\u2019s to the seller\u2019s bank account, while the BTC tokens are moved to the Bakkt digital warehouse, where they can be picked up by the buyer. If the assets or money are not delivered, the clearing house covers the costs.\nThe whole process of the futures trading is overseen by the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). More specifically, the agency controls trading, clearing and safe storage of assets. The CFTC also approves and monitors the exchange\u2019s rules in regard to those areas.\nSafe storage\nOn top of strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) policies that are essential for the CFTC\u2019s approval, Bakkt allegedly bolsters a robust storage system. As Loeffler told Fortune, it is one of the main criteria to attract large financial institutions:\n\u201cA qualified warehouse is the difference between institutional investors\u2019 getting in or staying out.\u201d\nTo prevent security breaches \u2014 which remain one of the most feared problems for cryptocurrency exchanges \u2014 Bakkt plans to store the private keys offline in its reportedly heavily guarded \u201cwarehouse,\u201d which essentially resembles cold wallets. According to Fortune, the platform will utilize double-key security, where the clients access their funds using the private key while the warehouse releases them using a public key \u2014 just like with safety deposit boxes at brick-and-mortar banks, which require both keys to be unlocked.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Azure and off-blockchain transactions\nAs for the technical part of the operation, Bakkt is reportedly based on Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud computing service, which works through Microsoft-controlled data centers \u2014 and is hence centralized.\nTo deal with BTC\u2019s notorious scalability issue, Bakkt will reportedly use a technology akin to the Lightning Network and build a system that largely operates outside of blockchain.\n\u201cOur system would operate on a layer above the blockchain, and we\u2019d keep our own omnibus ledger apart from the blockchain,\u201d Loeffler explained to Fortune.\nIn other words, transactions would be send within one ecosystem and won\u2019t heavily rely on blockchain, which can normally perform only seven transactions per second.\nRetail payments (potential plan for the future)\nBesides establishing a platform for institutional investors who are still hesitant to enter the crypto market, Bakkt\u2019s founders \u2014 Loeffler and Sprecher \u2014 also hope to make BTC payments more common, as they told Fortune. That could push BTC adoption within the retail payments industry as well, where banks and credit card issuers take their cut for each transaction.\nThat idea could be picked by both Microsoft and Starbucks, two major backers of Bakkt. While the IT giant represents a large base of retailers, handling their operations through the aforementioned Azure technology, Starbucks seems to have plans to accept BTC for its lattes in the future, as Maria Smith, vice president of partnerships and payments for Starbucks, stated in the original press release:\n\u201cAs the flagship retailer, Starbucks will play a pivotal role in developing practical, trusted, and regulated applications for consumers to convert their digital assets into U.S. dollars for use at Starbucks.\u201d\nThe project has been delayed several times, as regulators are taking their time\nBakkt\u2019s launch has been postponed several times now, which can hardly surprise the crypto community, who are used to various differals regularly announced by major industry participants, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ethereum (ETH) developers.\nFirst, the digital assets platform was expected to open as early as November 2018. Then, the project\u2019s launch was rescheduled to Jan. 24, 2019. Currently, Bakkt is estimated to go live in \u201cearly 2019.\u201d The main reason for the delay is the CFTC\u2019s approval, which is still pending.\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal article published on Dec. 20, the CFTC \u201cis currently reviewing ICE\u2019s business plan.\u201d After that, the watchdog's commissioners are expected to vote on whether to approve the project \u201cearly in 2019.\u201d Then, the public will reportedly be asked to weigh in with comments during the next 30 days.\nAs per Bakkt\u2019s Medium entry published on Dec. 31, their team has made \u201cgreat progress\u201d in terms of negotiations with the agency, and currently awaits the regulatory green light. More specifically, Loeffler wrote:\n\u201cTo that end, our team has been working closely with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission [CFTC] for the better part of 2018. At an industry level, regulatory approval for physically delivered and warehoused bitcoin will establish and amplify the voice of U.S. authorities as the digital asset market evolves globally. We have filed our applications and the timing for approval is now based on the regulatory review process.\u201d\nSwaminathan is not surprised with the slow progress.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nUnited States banking giant JPMorgan Chase, whose CEO has been one of the most vocal critics of cryptocurrencies, has announced the launch of its own cryptocurrency, named \u201cJPM Coin.\u201d This clearly shows that many criticize the technology as they do not understand it, but once they realize its potential, they readily become a part of the space.\nAs the market matures, it will differentiate between cryptocurrencies. Token that do not have anything concrete to offer will fall by the wayside as others with a strong use case will reward their investors. Barry Silbert, CEO and founder of Digital Currency Group and Grayscale Investments, believes that most digital tokens \u201cwill go to zero.\u201d\nNiall Ferguson, British economic and financial historian and author of 14 books, said that Bitcoin is likely to be viewed as digital gold because its performance is not correlated to any other asset class. However, he does not see cryptocurrencies replacing fiat currencies completely. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWith most news turning positive, is it a good time to buy a few of the major cryptocurrencies? Let\u2019s find out.\nBTC/USD\nOver the past week, Bitcoin (BTC) has been giving up ground. Though the fall is not sharp, it shows a lack of demand at current levels. Both the moving averages have turned flat and the RSI is in the neutral zone, which points to a likely consolidation.\n\nOur view of a range bound trading action will be invalidated if the BTC/USD pair breaks out of the downtrend line. Above the downtrend line, a rally to $4,255 is likely. We expect a strong resistance at this level. A breakout of $4,255 will complete a double bottom pattern that has a target of $5,273.91.\nIf the bears sink the digital currency below the 20-day EMA, a drop to $3,355 and below it to $3,236.09 is possible. A break of the yearly low will resume the downtrend and can result in a decline to $3,000 and below it to $2,600.\nWe shall wait for the price to sustain above both the moving averages and the downtrend line before proposing a trade in it.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) continues to face resistance at the 50-day SMA. It has become a major roadblock for the bulls that needs to be crossed quickly, else we anticipate a fall to $116.30 and if that gets broken, a retest of $103.20.\n\nBoth the moving averages are flat and the RSI is just above the midpoint, which points to a consolidation. The ETH/USD pair will pick up momentum on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $134.50.\nThe next target on breaking out of $134.50 is $167.32. Considering the large target potential, we suggest traders maintain their stops at $100. We might recommend closing the position if the pair turns down and sustains below $116.30.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) has been finding support close to $0.295 for the past three days, but the bulls are struggling to break out of the downtrend line.\n\nA strong breakout of the downtrend line will carry the XRP/USD pair to the next overhead resistance of $0.33108. The 50-day SMA is also located just below this level. Hence, we expect this to act as a major roadblock. However, if the bulls scale this level, the probability of a rally to $0.40 increases. Therefore, we might propose long positions on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.33108.\nConversely, if the price turns down from the current levels or from one of the overhead resistances, a retest of $0.27795 is possible. A break of this level will result in a fall to the yearly low of $0.24508.\nEOS/USD\nEOS is trying to bounce from just above $2.70. The bulls will again attempt to break out of the overhead resistance zone of $3.05 to $3.2081. If successful, a rally to $3.8723 is probable. The 20-day EMA is turning up and the RSI is also in positive territory, which shows that the path of least resistance is to the upside. Hence, traders can keep the stop loss on long positions at $2.30.\n\nIf the price struggles to break out of the overhead resistance zone, partial profits can be booked closer to $3.20 and the remaining can be held with the stop at breakeven.\nOn the contrary, if the EOS/USD pair turns down from current levels, it can take support at the moving averages, failing which the drop can extend to the critical support at $2.1733. A break of this support can result in a plunge to the yearly low of $1.55.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) found support close to $40. The bulls are currently trying to resume the uptrend and break out of the overhead resistance of $47.2460. If successful, the next target to watch on the upside is $56.910.\n\nContrary to our assumption, if the LTC/USD pair fails to breakout of $47.2460, it might turn down and retest the support at 20-day EMA. Therefore, traders can book partial profits closer to $47 if they find the pair struggling to move up.\nA break below the 20-day EMA will weaken the momentum and plunge the digital currency to the 50-day SMA. The trend will turn negative if the bears break below $27.701. Traders who are long can trail their stops higher to $36. The stops can be moved up again as the price inches towards $47.2460.\nBCH/USD\nThe range in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has shrunk as it waits for a decisive move by either the bulls or the bears. Volatility is likely to expand soon, but it is difficult to predict the direction of the move.\n\nIf the tight range resolves to the upside, the bulls will face resistance at the 50-day SMA and above it at $141. If the price sustains above $141, it will be a bullish sign, hence, we recommend long positions on a close (UTC time frame) above $141. The target levels to watch on the upside are $175 and above it $220.\nOn the contrary, if the BCH/USD pair breaks down, the next support is $105. Below this level, the decline can accelerate and retest the low at $73.50.\nTRX/USD\nTRON (TRX) has broken below the 50-day SMA and has moved lower in the past two days. The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover, which indicates weakness in the short-term. Therefore, traders can keep a stop loss of $0.023 to protect their long positions.\nA breakdown of $0.023 can result in a decline to the next support at $0.02113440 and if this level also cracks, the final support is $0.0183. Below this level, a drop to the yearly low is probable.\n\nConversely, if the TRX/USD pair finds support at the current levels and rises above both the moving averages, it will again attempt to break out of the critical resistance at $0.02815521. If successful, the pair is likely to start a new uptrend that can carry it to $0.038 and $0.04.\nXLM/USD\nFirst signs of buying in Stellar (XLM) near the lows. The bulls are attempting to scale the 20-day EMA. If successful, a move up to the downtrend line and above it to the 50-day SMA is possible. We like that the RSI is showing strength and is pointing towards a pullback. However, as the price is still near the lows, we will avoid suggesting a trade in it.\n\nIf the XLM/USD pair turns down from one of the overhead resistances, the bears will again try to break down of the low at $0.07256747. If the low is broken, the next support is at $0.05795397. We shall wait for a new buy setup to form before recommending a trade.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) corrected for three days and found buyers close to the 20-day EMA. It is currently attempting to resume the up move and break out of the overhead resistance at $10. If successful, a rally to $12 is probable. The range between $10\u2013$12 is a major hurdle, hence, the cryptocurrency might remain in this range for some time. On clearing this hurdle, a rally to $15 and above it to $18 is possible.", "birthday": "2019-02-15T20:34:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-15 20:34:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 15}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nDuring a bull phase, any amount of supply is easily absorbed as the traders are keen to buy on every dip. However, when the sentiment sours and the price fails to stage a recovery, most traders become sellers.\nWhile it is difficult to pinpoint a single reason for the prolonged fall of the crypto prices, the continued selling of Bitcoin (BTC) by the Mt. Gox trustee between February and June of 2018 could have exacerbated the fall.\nNow, despite the fact that the fundamentals are improving and cryptocurrencies and blockchain are seeing wider adoption, the sentiment needs to change for a new uptrend to start. Chinese billionaire Zhao Dong, nonetheless, believes that the time to buy Bitcoin is now as he thinks that the only thing traders need right now is patience.\nMike Novogratz, founder of crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital believes that Bitcoin will command a premium and will become the \u201cdigital gold\u201d among cryptocurrencies. He has expects BTC to reach $8,000 in the medium term.\nLet\u2019s analyze the charts and find out the patterns that are developing in the major cryptocurrencies.\nBTC/USD\nUnlike the altcoins, Bitcoin (BTC) is not showing a clear trend or a confirmation of a bottom. Both moving averages are flat, and the RSI is just above the midpoint, which suggests a balance between the bulls and the bears.\n\nThe critical resistance to watch on the upside is the downtrend line. A break out of this can launch the BTC/USD pair towards $4,255. Above that level, a double bottom pattern will complete with a minimum target objective of $5,273.91.\nOn the other hand, if the bears plunge the leading cryptocurrency below the support zone of $3,236.09\u2013$3,355, the downtrend will resume. The next level to watch is $3,000, which is a psychological support. If it also breaks, the downtrend can extend to $2,600.\nWe shall wait for the price to sustain above the downtrend line before recommending any long positions.\nETH/USD\nAfter trading close to the 50-day SMA for the past three days, Ethereum (ETH) is again attempting to break out of it. Above the 50-day SMA, the next resistance is at $134.5. If the bulls clear both of these resistances, the cryptocurrency can rally to $167.32.\n\nThe ETH/USD pair will lose momentum if the bears sink it below the first support of $116.3. The trend will turn negative if the price continues to slide and plunges below $103.2. Therefore, we suggest traders hold their long positions with the stop loss at $100.\nThe flattish moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint are pointing towards a range bound action. We might get a clear picture within the next few days.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) is close to the downtrend line, but hasn\u2019t been able to scale it. A small positive is that it has not corrected to the support of $0.27795 once again.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is flattening out, and the RSI is just below the midpoint. This means that there is a balance between the buyers and the sellers in the short term. The XRP/USD pair might remain range bound between $0.27795 and $0.33108 for the next few days.\nA break out of $0.33108 will signal a probable change in trend that can push the price to $0.38, and above it to $0.4. Hence, we might suggest long positions above $0.33108. Conversely, if the bears plunge the pair below $0.27795, a drop to the yearly low of $0.24508 will be probable.\nEOS/USD\nEOS had reached above $3.05, as we had anticipated. If the bulls scale this level, the move can extend to $3.2081.\nThis is the resistance line of the large range; hence, the traders can book partial profits close to this level and hold the rest with the stop at $2.3. We are not in favor of booking profits on the complete position because a break out of $3.2081 can result in a rally to $3.8723.\nThe 20-day EMA has started to turn up marginally, and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. This suggests that the bulls have a slight edge in the short term.\n\nContrary to our assumption, if the price turns down from the current levels, the EOS/USD pair can dip to the moving averages, which should act as a strong support. A break from this will indicate that the bears have the upper hand and a fall to $2.1733 is probable.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) is facing profit booking close to the overhead resistance at $47.246. The correction can reach the 20-day EMA, which is just below the downtrend line. We expect the price to rebound from this support.\nThe rebound will attempt to break out of $47.246 once again. If successful, the rally can extend to $56.910.\n\nHowever, if the LTC/USD pair fails to find support at the downtrend line and the 20-day EMA, it can slide to the 50-day SMA, below which a retest of the support at $27.701 will be probable.\nAs the 20-day EMA is moving up, and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, it shows that the bulls have the advantage. Hence, we suggest traders hold their long positions with the stops at $33.\nIf the next attempt to move to the upside finds resistance at $47.246, the traders can book partial profits and raise the stops on the remaining position to breakeven.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has been trading close to $121 for the past three days. Attempts to move away from this level have failed.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is flat, but the 50-day SMA has started to turn down. A breakdown and close below $121 can drag the BCH/USD pair to $105. If this support fails to hold, the decline can stretch to $73.5.\nConversely, if the pair bounces off the current levels, it can move up to $141. A breakout above the moving averages and the overhead resistance of $141 will indicate strength. As BCH is known for vertical rallies, we might suggest initiating long positions on a close (UTC time frame) above $141.\nTRX/USD\nAlthough the bulls have been holding Tron (TRX) above the 50-day SMA for the past three days, they haven\u2019t been able to achieve a rebound. This shows a lack of buying at these levels.\nThe 20-day EMA is turning down, and the RSI has also slipped into the negative territory, which suggests that the bears have the upper hand in the short-term. Without a strong bounce within the next couple of days, chances of a breakdown of the 50-day SMA increase.\n\nThe support on the downside is at $0.02113440, and if this level breaks, the fall can extend to the critical support of $0.0183.\nThe TRX/USD pair will indicate strength only on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above the overhead resistance of $0.02815521. Until then, every rise will be sold into. The traders holding long positions can keep their stop loss at $0.023.\nXLM/USD\nThough Stellar (XLM) is close to the yearly lows, it is not finding any buyers. The bulls haven\u2019t been able to scale the 20-day EMA since Jan. 10 of this year.\n\nThe trend remains down, as both moving averages are sloping down, and the RSI is close to the oversold territory. A breakdown of the lows will resume the downtrend that can sink the XLM/USD pair to $0.05795397.\nFirst signs of recovery will be when the bulls push the price above the downtrend line. Such a move can result in a rally to $0.13427050. As the pair has been a huge underperformer, we shall wait for a reliable buy setup to form before proposing a trade.\nBNB/USD\nAfter having reached the overhead resistance zone of $10\u2013$12, Binance Coin (BNB) is currently in a minor correction. The fall can reach the 20-day EMA, which is likely to act as a strong support. With both moving averages sloping up and the RSI in the overbought territory, the trend favors the bulls.\n", "birthday": "2019-02-13T18:41:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-13 18:41:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 13}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/iran-still-waiting-for-the-blockchain-revolution", "title": " Iran: Still Waiting for the Blockchain Revolution ", "content": "From Jan. 29 to 30, Tehran hosted the eighth annual conference on Electronic Banking and Payment Systems, which was promoted by the Monetary and Banking Research Institution, the research arm of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI). Among the announced topics under the theme of the \u201cBlockchain Revolution,\u201d it was the unveiling of the Iranian plan for a national digital currency that, as a matter of fact, remained rather vague after it was presented during the conference.\nIn his inaugural speech, Ali Divandari \u2014 the director of the Monetary and Banking Research Institution \u2014 stressed that \u201cthe realities of blockchain technology should be accepted.\u201d Also, many contributions from Iranian and foreign experts focused on the opportunities that fintech and blockchain could potentially open for the Iranian financial and banking industry.\nIn fact, blockchain seems to be a thrilling topic for Iran: Before the end of the meeting, four Iranian banks announced that they have developed a gold-backed cryptocurrency called PayMon, aiming to tokenize part of their reserves.\nBesides, immediately after the conference, CBI stated its overall approach, favoring to recognize and to authorize cryptocurrencies, ICOs, exchanges and mining. However, in the meanwhile, the central bank reiterated that using cryptocurrencies as methods of payment inside the country is still prohibited. Therefore, the road map toward a national digital currency and the future regulation of cryptocurrencies in the country remain uncertain.\nFor instance, Vice Governor of Information Technology for the Central Bank of Iran Naser Hakimi explained that the new policies of the CBI on the issue \u201care still in the queue for review [\u2026] given the many engagements that decision makers have in this regard,\u201d expressing the hope, nevertheless, to unveil them by the end of the year.\nMohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi, the minister of communications and information technology, on the other hand, stressed some of the issues that could arise in a process still managed by the state\u2019s central government:\n\u201cBlockchain\u2019s essence is decentralized and distributed. However, the Central Bank is the centralized institution for regulating banking, so blockchain is structurally in conflict with the Central Bank. And we cannot expect the central bank to promote it, but the central bank should find its way.\u201d\nAs a matter of fact, the end of the January conference is just the last step in a long and somewhat controversial walk of approach to cryptos that has involved Iran in the last couple of years.\n\nCautiously exploring cryptos\nThe interest of the Iranian authorities with regard to the opportunities and threats of cryptocurrencies dates back to at least the winter of 2017-18. For instance, during this period that saw an upward trend in terms of Bitcoin (BTC), the secretary of the presidential commission in charge of internet-related issues \u2014 named the Supreme Council of Cyberspace (SCC) \u2014 Abolhassan Firouzabadi, showed an attitude that, if not favorable, at least was not hostile toward digital currencies, putting forward the possibility of the state monitoring and regulating them, while the economic commission of the Majlis-e-Shuray-e Islami (the Iranian parliament), urged the CBI and the Ministry of Communications and IT to promote research, in view of the fact that the \u201cadvantages and disadvantages of Bitcoin haven't been surveyed comprehensively.\u201d\nIn this uncertain context, the main concerns were related to the risks involved in high volatility and in the \u201cungoverned\u201d nature of cryptocurrencies: At the end of 2017, and during the first months of 2018, the stance of different Iranian agencies and government bodies was one that aimed to forbid involvement in the cryptocurrency market of entities such as brokerage firms, exchange shops and the whole banking system \u2014 that is, until a new regulatory scheme would guarantee CBI\u2019s control of blockchain-based assets. All these measures together brought about a sort of ban on the trade of cryptocurrencies for all the private citizens, at least using official channels based in the country (it is important to note that Iranian citizens are usually banned from using international online exchanges).\nBesides worries that Teheran\u2019s decision-makers share with many governments around the world, the Iranian attitude toward cryptocurrencies could not ignore the vali-e-faqih, meaning the authority to have the last word in every controversial political issue, which, since the 1979 revolution, the Republic of Iran grants the Islamic jurists.\nIn January 2018, Seyyed Abas Mousavian, a member of the central bank's Islamic Jurisprudence Council, expressed doubts about \u201csharp fluctuations\u201d and a \u201clack of transparency in cryptocurrencies.\u201d By April, his doubts had became a verdict against crypto assets, criticized as \u201cnot halal\u201d because they are not based on any real asset and because \u201cthey cause faithful and believer society's wealth goes [sic] to unbelievers' pocket, paving the path for their dominance in the society.\u201d\nIn January 2019, the news headquarters of eighth annual conference on Electronic Banking and Payment Systems quoted the most recent authoritative statements by Mousavian:\n\u201cI do not consider Bitcoin as money. Because money must have consistency to be able to value other assets based on it. An item whose value is shifted 19 times over the course of one year indicates that the nature of this so-called money is not capable of being used as a benchmark for measuring assets. [...] I sometimes call it a mysterious money. It's coded, and mysterious at the same time, because its dimensions are not known.\u201d\nA virtual coin against the Great Satan\nIn spite the criticism, cryptocurrencies could exist in terms of both of monetary orthodoxy and of Sharia. Consequently, Iranian authorities \u2014 or part of them, at least \u2014 are looking to digital money as a potential solution for some of the problems the country is facing. Among the strongest supporters of an Iranian way to blockchain is Azari Jahromi. An information and communications technology engineer and manager, he was born in 1982 and he was appointed as the minister of communications and information technology in August 2017, becoming the youngest member of the cabinet lead by President Hassan Rouhani.\n\nCommitted to a more progressive approach to the development of the internet in Iran,\u00a0since February 2018, Jahromi has sponsored the idea of a national digital currency that, as Cointelegraph has already noted, presents strong analogies with the Venezuelan Petro. The advancement of the road map was repeatedly announced throughout the last year, notably in April, August and November. \u00a0\nLast summer, IBENA, the news agency affiliate to the CBI, disclosed the main features of the future national digital currency as:\n\u201c1. It is rial-backed. [...]\u00a02. The issuer is Central Bank of Iran and the volume of issuance depends on the bank's decision.\u00a03. Iranian cryptocurrency has been developed under private blockchain infrastructure and cannot be mined.\u00a04. The infrastructure is supposed to be as an ecosystem available for Iranian banks and active companies in cryptocurrencies area.\u201d\nDuring the conference on Electronic Banking and Payment Systems, Jahromi reported that the CBI is presently testing five different blockchain projects.\nHowever, despite being a simple tool in the hands of the banking system, the upcoming Iranian cryptocurrency could become another element in the diplomatic confrontation between Iran and the United States, which has escalated since the beginning of May 2018, when U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally rejected the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the deal \u2014 commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 signed in 2015 by the U.S., Iran, the United Kingdom, France and Germany to freeze both Iranian nuclear plans and the subsequent international retaliation.\nA soon as the U.S. reimposed sanctions on any foreign company that continues to do business with Iran, the plan for a national digital currency appeared as a useful tool to facilitate the international transfer of value, even in the context of an embargo. Iranian sources reported that, last May, President Rouhani received advice from Chinese entrepreneur Bobby Lee in a Tweet saying:\n\u201cIf you really want to threaten President Trump, you should stop using fiat money.\u201d\nHowever, it is more likely that the whole project for a national digital currency, since its beginning, has taken into account the possibility of worsening relations with the U.S. administration.\nU.S. sanctions coming back into effect on some Iranian financial institutions at the beginning of November 2018, for instance, caused the Belgium-based SWIFT financial messaging service to disconnect some Iranian banks: Iranian researchers are positive that the new central bank-issued digital currency or other blockchain-based solutions could compensate for the rising isolation from the traditional international financial network.\nAs a matter of fact, a digital coin running on a private, state-controlled blockchain, without any economic incentive to sustain the network, would likely encounter very limited opportunities for wide adoption. However, the Iranian press recently reported ongoing negotiations with eight countries \u2014 Switzerland, South Africa, France, the U.K., Russia, Austria, Germany and Bosnia) to carry out financial transactions in cryptocurrency: If and how the \u201cdigital rial\u201d would take part in these is unclear. However, the news media stressed how many expectations Iran has with regard to blockchain technology as a way of circumventing sanctions.\nA hint about how serious the Islamic Republic is in terms of its \u201cgoing crypto\u201d comes from the reaction of U.S. authorities. Even if no real evidence supports the claim that, in July 2018, the U.S. government confiscated about 500 BTC belonging to Iranian citizens \u2014 an action which seems rather infeasible from a technical point of view \u2014 it\u2019s true that, since last October, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau inside the Department of Treasury, warned \u201cvirtual currency administrators and exchangers\u201d about the risks of being involved in illicit activities fostered by Teheran\u2019s regime.\nEventually, at the end of the year, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Mike Gallagher introduced a bill in the U.S. Congress (Blocking Iranian Illicit Finance Act) encompassing articles aimed to forbid U.S. citizens from engaging in any operation involving a hypothetical Iranian digital currency. It also introduced sanctions on foreign individuals dealing in it.\nBTCs flight away\nWhile Iranian authorities are looking to cryptocurrencies as a possible tool for dodging the recently-imposed sanctions, Iranian citizens resort to them in order to overcome the fragility of their own domestic currency. The crisis of the Iran nuclear deal, in fact, leading to a severe devaluation of the rial, made the option to convert part of their savings into Bitcoin attractive for many Iranians.\nImmediately after the U.S. reimposed the sanctions, Iranian sources reported that about $2.5 billion left the country as cryptocurrencies.\nAs a matter of fact, to buy or to own cryptocurrencies is not forbidden in Iran, even if trading in crypto asset is not allowed for any legitimate business, and the very nature of crypto remains suspicious from many points of view \u2014 not least the religious one. On the other hand, mining has been accepted as an industry since September 2018, a sign of an evolving, yet confusing framework.\nNo official figures exist that measure how widespread cryptocurrencies are in Iran. However, the U.S. FinCEN defines the use of virtual currency in Iran as \u201ccomparatively small,\u201d estimating transactions to be about $3.8 million worth per year. Besides, some proxies have emerged from data gathered by the website Coin Dance, on the basis of the weekly volumes of BTC recorded by Localbitcoins. This confirms a rather low level of diffusion, alongside some peaks during the periods of maximum concern about the sanctions and the value of the rial (April-May, September-November 2018). In any case, the highest volumes matched the global highs of the December 2017/January 2018 rally and never surpassed 80 BTC per week.\n\nEven if available data is not complete, Western sources report that, since May 2018, Iranian citizens are encountering enormous difficulties converting their savings into foreign currencies or sending them abroad (for instance, to relatives living in less-troubled countries): In such a context, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would appear as a valuable life jacket, despite their high degree of volatility during the last few months.\nIran is perhaps experiencing a phenomenon called hyperbitcoinization, an answer that other countries \u2014 such as Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Turkey and Argentina \u2014 proposed for the rapid inflation and economic crises they are experiencing, turning to crypto as a store of value and a means of exchange. As a matter of fact, BTC would appear as a better store of value than rial, even in one of the blackest periods for the crypto market (to get a correct figure, it is necessary to consider the actual exchange rate on the free market, rather than the official fixed rate).\n", "birthday": "2019-02-13T17:11:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-13 17:11:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 13}

Gox Trustee May Have Crashed Bitcoin in 2018 by Dumping It on an Exchange, but There Is Still Hope ", "content": "The now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox reportedly liquidated around $312 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) throughout February and June of 2018 through a Japanese exchange called BitPoint.\nGoxDox, an organization that was established to assist Mt. Gox creditors, released a photograph of a bank account statement on February 5 showing the alleged transactions sent from BitPoint to the Mt. Gox trustee led by Nobuaki Kobayashi.\n\nIf the report of GoxDox is accurate, the trustee went out of his way to disregard the suggestion of Kraken CEO Jesse Powell, who explicitly told the trustee to refrain from selling the company\u2019s BTC holdings. If needed, Powell previously said that the trustee has to liquidate the remaining Bitcoin funds on an over-the-counter (OTC) trading platform to minimize its impact on the price of Bitcoin.\nIt is possible that the trustee and the rest of the individuals dealing with the Mt. Gox case were rattled by the circumstances, prematurely liquidating a significant portion of the organization\u2019s assets to move forward with the bankruptcy.\nWas the dump of Mt. Gox the primary cause of Bitcoin\u2019s crash in 2018?\nAccording to GoxDox, the Mt. Gox trustee began to sell the exchange\u2019s Bitcoin holdings starting in early 2018, possibly even before February. From early February to June, the trustee is said to have sold tens of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin on a weekly basis.\nThe researchers said that the frequent wire transfers supposedly initiated from the bank account of BitPoint to that of the Mt. Gox trustee show the trustee\u2019s intent to hide the transactions in an event of a security breach on the side of BitPoint.\nThe trustee likely expected a public backlash if it were revealed that the trustee had been selling large amounts of Bitcoin in the public cryptocurrency exchange market, putting the price of BTC at a significant risk of dropping.\n\u201cIt seems fair to conclude that the reason for sending frequent wires was to prevent counterparty risk. A hack at BitPoint could expose the MtGox Estate to a loss and the trustee didn't want to get Goxxed. It follows that the trustee would have instructed BitPoint to wire JPY [Japanese yen] over as soon as he had it. This way, MtGox Estate assets wouldn't be exposed to any hacking incident at BitPoint.\u201d\nOn May 2, based on the data provided by GoxDox, the trustee received 3,822,436,400 yen from BitPoint, worth around $34,845,330. From then on, at an interval of one to four days, the trustee continued to receive tens of millions of dollars from BitPoint.\nCoincidentally, in the exact same time frame, the price of Bitcoin, which initiated a strong recovery from $7,000 to $10,000 from April to May, began to plunge. Since May 4, the price of Bitcoin began to drop substantially against the United States dollar. By the end of June, less than two months since the sell-off of Mt. Gox holdings began, the price of the dominant cryptocurrency dropped from nearly $10,000 to $5,912, by over 40 percent.\n\nIn February 2018, when the trustee started to sell BTC on a cryptocurrency exchange, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell reaffirmed that the company, which was hired to track the lost coins of the exchange, advised the trustee not to dump millions of dollars worth of BTC in the market.\n\u201cWe were explicit about not dumping a large amount of coins on the market. Unfortunately, it looks like the trustee made their own decision or was taking advice from elsewhere \u2014 maybe whatever exchange they dumped those coins on. We had zero knowledge of these sales happening until it was announced at the recent creditors' meeting.\u201d\nThe initial correction of the cryptocurrency market in January of last year may have been completely unaffected by the Mt. Gox situation, which cannot be confirmed due to the lack of information presented in the leaked bank statement of the trustee. Some analysts have suggested that the opening of the CME Bitcoin futures market crashed the price of the asset.\nThe San Francisco Federal Reserve wrote that the time frame of the decline in the price of Bitcoin aligned with the launch of the CME Bitcoin futures market.\n\"The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence. It is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset.\u201d\nOthers have said that the short-term bubble of BTC initiated by retail traders came to an end, and it was not caused by a specific set of factors.\nBut, from February onward, it is believed by traders that the unexpected liquidation of a large chunk of Bitcoin\u2019s circulating supply had a drastic impact on the short-term trend of the asset.\nThe trustee was heavily criticized by industry experts including GoxDox researchers, who said that Mt. Gox creditors need to demand an explanation from the trustee to clarify the reasoning behind the dismissal of the advice of Kraken.\n\u201cSimple possession of a crypto license is not suitable criteria for selecting an expert. A non-expert judge's approval does not equate to a sound plan. Reliance on an appeal to authority is never a substitute for good judgment.\u201d\nHow does Mt. Gox move on from here?\nOn Jan. 22, Brock Pierce, a cryptocurrency investor and the co-founder of Blockchain Capital, who played a vital role in the development of EOS, revealed an ambitious plan to revive Mt. Gox and to repay all of the creditors of the exchange.\nWhile the exchange is said to have around $1.2 billion worth of Bitcoin, with the supposed sale of more than $300 million worth of Bitcoin in 2018, it remains unclear precisely how much BTC the exchange currently possesses. It is not possible, given the circumstances of Mt. Gox, to repay all of the creditors through the sale of the company\u2019s existing BTC.\nInstead, Brock Pierce, who claims to acquire Mt. Gox for 2 BTC from Mark Karpeles and Jed McCaleb in 2014, decided to try to reopen the exchange and pay the creditors using the equity of the company.\nAs a first step, Pierce condemned the work of the Mt. Gox trustee and prevented the trustee from liquidating the company\u2019s holdings with his authority over the company, according to the official statement of GoxRising, a British Virgin Islands-based company established to oversee Mt. Gox:\n\u201cAcknowledging that the Mt. Gox trustee had done a laudable job of managing an unwieldy estate, the group suggested that the inherent limitations on the trustee's discretionary powers as a fiduciary, prevented him from maximizing creditor returns going forward.\u201d\nAt the North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC), Pierce further explained that the company intends to revive Mt. Gox through a unified Civil Rehabilitation Plan, a law in Japan that forces lenders of a company to change the terms of the loan. In the upcoming months, the company is expected to pay out $1.2 billion in BTC to creditors as fast as possible and move on with resuming operations.\nOne hurdle worth $16 billion\nMt. Gox could distribute its $1.2 billion Bitcoin holdings in the next two months and rush the process of obtaining a license from Japan\u2019s Financial Services Agency (FSA) to begin operating as a regulated cryptocurrency exchange.\nBut blockchain incubator CoinLab reportedly filed a $16 billion claim against Mt. Gox, alleging Mt. Gox of breaching a contract with the company. Previously, CoinLab filed a $75 million lawsuit. Last week, according to a leaked document, the firm bumped up its lawsuit to a 16 billion claim.\n\nIn an event in which the claim is approved by the court, even with a compromise, it could result in the loss of a significant portion of the exchange\u2019s $1.2 billion holdings of BTC.\nFollowing the filing of the complaint, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell expressed his disappointment.", "birthday": "2019-02-12T18:08:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-12 18:08:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 12}

After the CEO of the Canadian exchange, 30-year-old Geral Cotten, suddenly died, the exchange has allegedly lost access to its cold wallets, where as much as 190 million Canadian dollars ($145 million) in digital assets were stored.\nThe firm has since managed to obtain creditor protection in the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, which has granted it with a 30-day stay of proceedings under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) \u2014 which will end on March 7 \u2014 to search for the missing funds.\nAccording to court filings cited by Reuters, the company is considering selling its platforms to cover its debts.\nWhile it\u2019s still unclear what will happen once the CCAA order expires, the case itself has raised a lot of questions.\nCotten had exclusive access to the cold wallets\nGiven that QuadrigaCX was a major crypto exchange in Canada \u2014 in fact, in 2015, it became the largest in the country \u2014 its funds management was surprisingly insecure.\nAccording to the affidavit filed by Cotten\u2019s wife, Jennifer Robertson, she learned from Alex Hanin, the chief website architect of QuadrigaCX\u2019s website, and Aaron Mathews, the director of operations at the exchange, that her husband \u201ctook sole responsibility for the handling the funds and coins and the banking and accounting side of the business.\u201d\nTherefore, Cotten was entirely accountable for the wallets and corresponding keys to $145 million in digital assets. Robertson said in the affidavit:\n\u201cQuadriga keeps only a minimal amount of coins on the server [a hot wallet]. The normal procedure was that Gerry would move the majority of the coins to cold storage as a way to protect the coins from hacking or other virtual theft.\u201d\nRobertson added that \u201cdespite repeated and diligent searches,\u201d she has not been able to find the keys \u2014 or access his encrypted laptop, where they could be stored.\nAs Taylor Monahan, ex-developer of Ethereum (ETH) wallet interface MyEtherWallet (MEW) who is now CEO of the MyCrypto project, previously told Cointelegraph that the idea of large amounts of digital assets being locked out because they were controlled by one person seems \u201cbeyond absurd\u201d:\n\u201cThe fact that a person controlling millions of customer assets didn\u2019t have any sort of backup in place, gave no one else access, and didn\u2019t leave any information regarding these accounts with anyone is beyond absurd. If this is indeed the truth, any number of outside factors could have resulted in the loss of access to those customer funds, like fire, flood, misplacing the single piece of paper, etc.\u201d\nSimilarly, Michael Gokturk, CEO of Vancouver-based digital assets platform Einstein Exchange, told The Globe and Mail that having entire access to those funds would make Cotten particularly vulnerable to kidnapping or other forms of extortion:\n\u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of walking around with millions of dollars in cash on you at all times.\u201d\nWill was filed just two weeks prior to Cotten\u2019s death \u2014 and it mentioned everything but the keys\nCourt documents cited by The Globe and Mail show that Cotten filed a will on Nov. 27, just 12 days before his death. As per the will, the QuadrigaCX CEO made his wife the executor of his estate and left her all his assets \u2014 which, according to CBC\u2019s estimations, added up to $9.6 million.\nThe list of Cotten\u2019s belongings outlined in the will is rather long: Specifically, it includes several properties in Nova Scotia and in British Columbia, a 2017 Lexus, an airplane, a Jeanneau 51 yacht and two of his pet chihuahuas named Nitro and Gully, along with $100,000 for their care. Moreover, Cotten reportedly left his frequent flier points and reward points to Robertson.\nIn case of Robertson death, in turn, Cotten\u2019s assets would be divided among other family members, CBC reports. Thus, his plane, Lexus and a property in Kelowna, British Columbia \u2014 were left to his brother and his sister-in-law, while \u201cvarious\u201d Nova Scotia properties and his sailboat would allegedly be bequeathed to his parents.\nNevertheless, the keys to QuadrigaCX\u2019s cold wallets \u2014 or any other ways of accessing those funds \u2014 aren\u2019t mentioned anywhere in the papers \u2014 which might be strange, given that Cotten actually thought about his death and filed related documents.\nExpert analysis show no definite signs of \u2018cold wallets\u2019\nRobertson claim that the funds at QuadrigaCX would normally be held in a cold wallet, reteriated the exchange\u2019s policy that could be traced back to 2014, when a CNBC article was published, stating that the exchange held the majority of its assets in offline storage.\nHowever, after the news about Cotten\u2019s death and QuadrigaCX application for the CCAA broke, community members began tracing the funds and found out that the notorious cold wallets might not exist at all.\nFor instance, Taylor Monahan of MyCrypto, who has also been analyzing ETH wallet addresses attributed to QuadrigaCX, has yet to find any signs of cold wallets. She told Cointelegraph:\n\u201cBased on what I\u2019ve seen with their other main Ethereum wallets, I haven\u2019t found any signs of a cold wallet. We can see large amounts of ETH move between their known \u2018hot\u2019 wallets. We see large amounts of ETH being moved temporarily to a variety of addresses before quickly being sent onto an exchange. But we don\u2019t see any significant amount of funds being moved to something that resembles \u2018cold\u2019 storage.\u201d\nOther research, published on cryptocurrency portal Zerononcense Blog, also argues that QuadrigaCX never had offline storage, per se. The report explicitly states:\n\u201cIt appears that there are no identifiable cold wallet reserves for QuadrigaCX.\u201d\nAccording to the research, the exchange likely only had cryptocurrency reserves of under $100 million. Further, the report contains alleged evidence that shows that someone had access to the company\u2019s wallets after Cotten died, reportedly making several outgoing transactions since Dec. 9.\nCotten\u2019s death itself raises some questions as well\nRobertson announced her husband\u2019s unexpected death on Jan. 15 \u2014 more than a month after he passed away \u201cdue to complications with Crohn's disease.\u201d According to the widow\u2019s statement published via QuadrigaCX\u2019s Facebook page, Cotten perished while travelling in India. The disease itself is not normally fatal, but might entail life-threatening complications.\nSoon after hearing about Cotten\u2019s passing, QuadrigaCX users took to social media to argue whether Cotten is actually dead, citing a lack of proof.\nAs per The Globe and Mail, the CCAA filings included a statement of death issued by J.A. Snow Funeral House in Halifax.\nFurther, according to Times of India, Cotten spent a day at the Fortis Escorts hospital in Jaipur, where he was admitted on Dec. 8, before dying of a \u201ccardiac arrest.\u201d The QuadrigaCX CEO was reportedly accompanied to the hospital by his wife.\nAs per the report, Cotten was \u201cfeeling feverish\u201d and complained of vomiting, watery stools and crampy abdominal pain. Upon admission, he was diagnosed with \"septic shock, perforation, peritonitis, intestinal obstruction.\u201d He was reportedly declared dead at 7:26 p.m. on Dec. 9 after several episodes of heart malfunction.\nThat information is echoed in an alleged death certificate issued by the local municipality, which has since surfaced online. However, the document still raised concern among Reddit users, who noted that Cotten\u2019s surname was misspelled as \u201cCottan.\u201d It also doesn\u2019t specify the exact time of death.\nQuadriga continued accepting deposits after it knew it couldn't access cold wallets \u2014 and had past banking problems\nSeveral reports indicate that QuadrigaCX continued to accept funds long after Cotten\u2019s alleged death on Dec. 9. The exchange was shut down on Jan. 29, after Robertson, who says she was not involved in the business while her husband was alive, filed an application to hold an emergency meeting, where board directors then allegedly decided to close down the website. Interestingly, the official announcement cited maintenance issues as the reason for closure.\nTherefore, while Robertson and QuadrigaCX executives knew about Cotten\u2019s death \u2014 and therefore acknowledged that they could not access their cold wallets \u2014 being on the verge of a liquidity crisis \u2014 they continued to accept deposits from customers.\nAt the time, QuadrigaCX\u2019s traders had already been reporting withdrawal issues, with complaints dating back to as early as early 2018, when the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) froze five accounts belonging to Quadriga\u2019s payment processor, Costodian Inc., and its owner, Jose Reyes. Combined, they reportedly contained around $19.6 million.\nPatryn\u2019s role in QuadrigaCX \u2014 and his (unproven) ties to a convicted money launderer\nCotten founded the digital assets exchange back in 2013 along with Michael Patryn, an active member of the Vancouver Bitcoin Co-op, a voluntary association of local cryptocurrency enthusiasts, of which Cotten was a director.\nIn May 2015, in one of his first public appearances as QuadrigaCX co-founder, Patryn revealed that his company was selling over-the-counter (OTC) shares for Bitcoin.\nAfter that, in March 2016, the British Columbia Securities Commision (BCSC) barred QuadrigaCX from selling securities after hitting it with a cease trade order (CTO) for not submitting annual audited financial statements for the fiscal year that ended Oct. 31, 2015.\nAbout a week before getting hit with the CTO, Quadriga started to undergo massive layoffs among the company\u2019s executives: First, directors Anthony Milewski and Lovie Horner resigned. Then, soon after the order was issued, Bill Filtness, a director, and Natasha Tsai, the chief financial officer, also quit the company. It appeared that Patryn and Cotten were the only seniors left in Quadriga.\nHowever, in March 2018, Quadriga\u2019s official Reddit account mentioned that Patryn was \u201can early [sic] who left the company more than two years ago.\u201d Although that checks out with his LinkedIn account, showing that he left the firm in February 2016, Patryn\u2019s resignation from Quadriga was never announced. Nevertheless, according to Patryn\u2019s recent comment for CBC, he worked with Cotten \u201cuntil a fight split them\u201d in 2016.\nFurther, Reddit users have linked Patryn to a convicted money launderer named Omar Dhanani. The theory mainly rested on the fact that Dhanani used the name Omar Patryn in a forfeiture case and that a fraudulent company called Midas Gold Exchange was started under the same name.\nQuadriga has denied this accusation, calling it \u201cnonsense.\u201d Patryn has also refuted those claims, saying that alias \u201cOmar Patry\u201d is just a coincidence.\nQuadriga transferred $500,000 in BTC to its cold wallets even after they got locked out\nOn Feb. 12, big four auditing firm Ernst & Young (EY), which has been appointed by the court as an independent third party to monitor Quadriga\u2019s hearings, published its \u201cFirst Report of the Monitor,\u201d suggesting that the Canadian exchange accidentally transferred nearly $500,000 in BTC to its cold wallets earlier this month.\nThat seems to complicate the case even further because, at the time, Quadriga clearly knew that it couldn\u2019t access those wallets (which, as mentioned above, have been reported as nonexistent by some third-party analysts in the crypto community). The EY document states:\n\u201cOn February 6, 2019, Quadriga inadvertently transferred 103 bitcoins valued at approximately $468,675 to Quadriga cold wallets which the Company is currently unable to access. The Monitor is working with Management to retrieve this cryptocurrency from the various cold wallets, if possible.\u201d\nErnst & Young also reported that it secured a number of Quadriga electronic devices for further analysis \u2014 allegedly owned or used by Cotten \u2014 including four laptops, four cell phones and three encrypted USB keys.\nQuadrigaCX used a fake address for its office", "birthday": "2019-02-13T16:27:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-13 16:27:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 13}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nBakkt recently completed its first acquisition of certain assets of futures commission merchant Rosenthal Collins Group (RCG). The much-awaited digital asset platform is expected to launch later in the year, according to Jeff Sprecher, CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Many expect institutional participation to increase with the launch of Bakkt.\nEx-hedge fund manager and CEO of Galaxy Digital, Michael Novogratz said in a tweet that he was surprised why the big macro funds did not invest one percent of their money in Bitcoin. If prices stabilize and there is clarity in regulations, we might see a few big funds make an entry into cryptocurrencies.\nNew York-based research company Fundstrat Global Advisors expects crypto prices to recover by the end of this year. They anticipate incremental improvements to boost prices.\nWhile all other asset classes are matured, cryptocurrencies are still in their early stages of development and offer huge potential in the future. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao believes that the Bitcoin revolution is only just starting. In a tweet, he said, \u201cWe are still early, the beginning of the beginning.\u201d\nLet\u2019s analyze the charts and try to predict which cryptocurrencies are showing the first signs of bottoming out.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) broke out of the 20-day EMA for the first time since Jan. 10. It is currently trading near the 50-day SMA. A bounce from the current level will carry it to the downtrend line, which has been a major hurdle since Nov. 24 of the previous year. If the price sustains above the downtrend line, it can move up to $4,255.\n\nA breakout of $4,255 completes a double bottom pattern, which has a target objective of $5,273.91. Hence, we might suggest buying about 30 percent of the desired allocation after the BTC/USD pair sustains above the downtrend line for a couple of days. The remaining position can be purchased above $4,255.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency turns down from the current levels or the downtrend line and plunges below the low of $3,236.09. Such a move will trigger a number of stop losses and resume the downtrend. The levels to watch on the downside are $3,000 and $2,600.\nThe flat moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint suggests a balance between the buyers and the sellers. We should get a decisive move within the next few days.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) triggered our buy recommendation on Feb. 8. It is currently facing resistance at the 50-day SMA. If the bulls sustain the price above $116.30, we anticipate another attempt to break out of the overhead resistance within the next few days.\n\nA breakout of the 50-day SMA and above it at $134.50 will increase the probability of a rally to $167.32. Hence, we suggest traders hold their long positions with the stop loss at $100.\nOur assumption will prove to be incorrect if the ETH/USD pair breaks down of $116.30. If the price sustains below $116.30, it can sink to $103.2, below which a drop to $83 is likely.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) is struggling to find buyers at higher levels. The strong bounce on Feb. 8 could not break out of the downtrend line.\n\nThe bulls are trying to hold the 20-day EMA, failing which, the XRP/USD pair will again decline to the critical support of $0.27795. Repeated tests of a support level weaken it, hence, if the price slides to $0.27795 within the next few days, we expect it to be broken. The next support on the downside is the yearly low of $0.24508.\nNevertheless, if the bulls manage to break out of the downtrend line, an up move to $0.33108 is likely. A breakout of this resistance will increase the chances of a rally to $0.40.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) reached our first target objective of $47.246 on Feb. 10. This is a significant resistance; hence, we anticipate a minor correction or a few days of consolidation at this level. The traders who are holding long positions can trail their stops higher to $33.\n\nWe anticipate a strong support closer to $40.784. If the LTC/USD pair bounces off the support, the bulls will again try to break out of $47.246. If successful, the next target is $56.910.\nThe 20-day EMA has turned up and the 50-day SMA is gradually sloping up. The RSI reached the overbought level for the first time since December 2017. This shows a probable change in trend.\nOur bullish view will be negated if the digital currency breaks below the moving averages. In such a case, it can drop to $27.701 and below it to the yearly low at $23.090.\nEOS/USD\nEOS closed with strength on Feb. 8, triggering our buy recommendation. It can reach $3.05 and above it to $3.2081. Traders can raise the stop loss to $2.30, which can be trailed higher in a couple of days.\nThe 20-day EMA is starting to turn up and the RSI is in the positive zone, which shows that the buyers have the upper hand. A break out above $3.2081 can carry the digital currency to $3.8723.\n\nThe bears are currently attempting to stall the pullback. If the EOS/USD pair turns down from current levels and slides below the moving averages, it will lose momentum. The critical level to watch on the downside is $2.1733. A break down of this level can plunge the pair to $1.7746 and below it to $1.55.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) broke out of the 20-day EMA on Feb. 8 but the bulls failed to build up on it. The price has corrected back to the breakout levels in the past two days. We expect strong support at the current levels.\n\nIf the BCH/USD pair re-enters the range, it can drop to $105. However, if the bulls bounce off the current levels, the pair will again try to move up to the next overhead resistance at $141. The flattish moving averages and the RSI close to the 50 levels points to a range bound trading in the near-term. We might suggest long positions if the price sustains above $141. Until then, we remain neutral on it.\nTRX/USD\nTron (TRX) is struggling to break out of the overhead resistance at $0.02815521. Repeated failure to break out of this level is a negative sign. The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has dropped to the negative zone. This points to an increase in selling in the short-term.\n\nIf the TRX/USD pair closes (UTC time frame) below the symmetrical triangle and the 50-day SMA, it can correct to $0.02113440 and below it to $0.0183. Traders can protect their long positions with the stop at $0.023.\nThe trend will again turn up if the bulls take support at the 50-day SMA and break out of the overhead resistance at $0.02815521. Such a move has a pattern target of $0.038. We should get a decisive move in this week.\nXLM/USD\nThe pullback in Stellar (XLM) was short-lived. It could not scale above the 20-day EMA, which shows a lack of demand even at these levels.\n\nWith both moving averages trending down and the RSI in the negative zone, the trend remains firmly in favor of the bears. If the XLM/USD pair breaks below the Feb. 6 low of $0.07256747, the decline can extend to $0.05795397.\nOn the contrary, if the bulls stage a recovery and climb above the 20-day EMA, the pair will attempt to move up to the downtrend line. A breakout of the 50-day SMA will be the first indication that the downtrend is coming to an end.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) extended its up move over the weekend. It is close to the overhead resistance zone of $10\u2013$12. We expect a strong supply in this zone, hence, a consolidation or a minor pullback is likely.", "birthday": "2019-02-12T00:05:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-12 00:05:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 12}

", "content": "Cryptocurrency crime trends have been in the spotlight in recent weeks, but SIM swapping has been strangely absent in a number of reports on 2018.\nCryptocurrency analytics companies CipherTrace and Chainalysis released two different reports focusing on the major crime trends in the space in 2018. While their data and findings sum up the biggest threats of the last 12 months, they\u2019ve omitted the prevalence of SIM swapping in recent times.\nHow it works\nSIM swapping is a relatively simple concept to understand, but the potential damage that can be done to an individual is scary, to say the least.\nCointelegraph approached multinational cybersecurity and anti-virus company Kaspersky Labs to provide an accurate definition of how SIM swapping works and the various ways in which it is carried out.\nAttackers obtain basic information about an individual, then use that to request that user\u2019s phone number to be switched to a SIM card that the attackers own. Once that is done, the attacker is able to receive any SMS that the victim receives.\nWith that access, the attacker can then request passwords and other sensitive user data from various service providers \u2014 like banks \u2014 and gain access to private accounts.\nKaspersky Labs security researcher Alexey Malanov says the act of replacing SIM cards to access two-factor authentication (2FA) credentials has become prevalent:\n\u201cA typical scenario can look like this: an attacker arrives at a regional department of a communication provider \u2014 like a mobile operator \u2014 with forged documents that are supposed to prove a customer\u2019s valid identity. Or, the attacker simply gets in close contact with an employee of the department and receives a duplicate of a victim\u2019s SIM cards. The authentic SIM card in the victim's phone turns off at that moment, so all subsequent SMS communications and phone calls are redirected to the attacker's phone.\u201d\nAccess to a user\u2019s 2FA gives a hacker a massive advantage when it comes to accessing and changing account details, which eventually gives them access to data and funds.\nTwo-factor authentication is an added security measure to protect access to a service like a cryptocurrency wallet. Users are still required to know the password to an account and possess a device to prove their identity.\nHowever, once a hacker has access to a user\u2019s credentials through a SIM swap, they can access the second factor of authentication, being able to receive SMS codes of the original users phone. Therefore, hackers have a far greater chance of being able to reset passwords to accounts, as Malanov explains:\n\u201cIf you have forgotten the password from the service, then you can often restore it using the same phone number to receive a text message. Sometimes additional knowledge is required (for example, a login or email address), but such information is often not strongly protected. That is why obtaining an unlocked phone from a victim, or at least access to receiving their SMS communications, will practically guarantee the success of the hack and a theft of funds.\u201d\nSim-swapping \u2014 more powerful than phishing?\nSIM swapping is not a new phenomenon, but given the technological advances of smartphones over the last decade, the information that can potentially be garnered by criminals using this method makes it a big threat to individuals and their privacy.\nModern times have seen the emergence of applications that allow people to access and manage their bank accounts and other sensitive financial information using smartphones and other devices.\nWhile this has created a new age of convenience, it also provides a unique opportunity for criminals to steal data and money from people around the world with relative ease.\nAs Chainalysis reported, Ethereum scams were of particular concern over the last two years, and a major tool of the scam artists and criminals was phishing. Simply put, users were duped by emails or communications that looked official, which lead to them providing sensitive information like usernames and password.\nThis gives criminals access to their accounts, which are then emptied by these nefarious groups.\nGiven that attackers can get enough information about a user, they can convince a service provider to carry out a SIM swap, giving the attacker access a user\u2019s SMS service.\nOnce they\u2019ve done this, the battle is already won, as they can request one-time passwords and other services that give them access to the user\u2019s accounts.\nThis modus operandi has traditionally targeted users\u2019 bank accounts, but these financial institutions have made concerted efforts to double-down on security checks and verification. However, if a user\u2019s funds are stolen, most financial institutions are able to roll back transactions or cover these circumstances with insurance protection.\nThis, unfortunately, is not the case when it comes to cryptocurrencies. If an attackers gains access to a user\u2019s private key or cryptocurrency wallet and sends cryptocurrency to another wallet, it is impossible to roll back the transaction.\nThis is why cryptocurrency wallets and private keys are seemingly becoming a focal point for SIM-swapping attacks.\nCrypto users in the crosshairs\nOne need look no further than the most recent SIM-swapping scandals in the crypto space to understand that this has become a lucrative way to steal and launder funds.\nAn in-depth report in November last year delved into the murky details of SIM swapping in the crypto community.\nAccording to numerous sources, attackers make use of social engineering to trick or convince telecommunication employees to carry out these SIM swaps. In some instances, the attackers bribe or threaten employees, while other employees abuse their access to customer information and feed that to hackers for financial incentives.\nFurthermore, cryptocurrency users are a preferred target due to the anonymous nature of the technology, which makes it easier to launder stolen funds. This has led to prominent people in the cryptocurrency space becoming targets of these attackers.\nKrebsonSecurity\u2019s interview with California-based law enforcement group Regional Enforcement Allied Computer Team (REACT) Task Force uncovers a number of instances in which active members of the crypto community have fallen prey, like Christian Ferri, CEO of cryptocurrency firm BlockStar.\nHackers managed to carry out a SIM swap through Ferri\u2019s mobile operator, whose database they had access to. Once that was done, they reset his Gmail password with the use of his cellphone number \u2014 then specifically used information from a Google Document to steal funds from his crypto wallet. As KrebsonSecurity notes, the hackers could have stolen more, but they seemed to be targeting Ferri\u2019s cryptocurrency holdings.\nCatching perpetrators\nSIM swappers have enjoyed relative success through their endeavors, but a swathe of arrests in 2018 highlighted the carelessness of a few young criminals.\nJuly 2018 marks the first time someone was arrested for SIM swapping in the crypto space, as California police arrested 20-year-old Joe Ortiz, who had allegedly hacked around 40 victims. Ortiz and a group of still unidentified collaborators targeted users in the crypto space, hacking a number of victims at the Consensus conference in New York in May. The 20 year old pleaded guilty to theft amounting to $5 million and accepted a plea deal of 10 years in prison for his crimes at the end of January 2019 \u2014 in what authorities describe as the first conviction of a crime for SIM swapping.\nFollowing that, 19-year-old Xzavyer Narvaez was arrested in California in August 2018 for using SIM swapping to commit computer crimes, identity fraud and grand theft. Narvaez was careless in his use of his ill-gotten gains, buying a number of sports cars over a two-year period, which formed part of the evidence authorities used to press charges. Furthermore, Narvaez\u2019s cryptocurrency account processed around 157 Bitcoin between March and July 2018, valued at over $1 million dollars at the time.\nJust a month later, in September 2018, 21-year-old hacker Nicholas Truglia was arrested for stealing $1 million worth of cryptocurrency by using a SIM swap to access the victim\u2019s account.\nIn November 2018, two men \u2014 aged 23 and 21 \u2014 were arrested for stealing $14 million from a cryptocurrency company by using SIM swaps.\nFollowing Ortiz\u2019s prosecution in January 2019, 20-year-old Dawson Bakies was indicted in February for stealing the identities and funds of over 50 victims across the country in a SIM-swapping scandal orchestrated from his home. This was the first successful indictment of a criminal for using SIM swapping in New York.\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance said the case sends out a strong message to perpetrators of these crimes:\n\u201cToday my Office is putting the small handful of sophisticated \u2018SIM Swappers\u2019 out there on notice. We know what you\u2019re doing, we know how to find you, and we will hold you criminally accountable, no matter where you are. We\u2019re also asking wireless carriers to wake up to the new reality that by quickly porting SIMs \u2014 in order to ease new activations and provide speedy customer service \u2014 you are exposing unwitting, law-abiding customers to massive identity theft and fraud.\u201d\nOn Feb. 4, California prosecutors indicted 21-year-old Ahmad Hared and 23-year-old Matthew Ditman with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, access device fraud, extortion and aggravated identity theft through the use of SIM swapping. The pair are accused of trying to gain access to funds controlled by executives of cryptocurrency-related companies and cryptocurrency investors. They face potential five-year jail sentences and hefty fines.\nShould service providers share the blame?\nAn United States investor, Michael Terpin, who fell prey to a SIM swap carried out by Truglia, made a move in August 2018 that would look to hold telecom service providers accountable for negligence that led to fraudulent SIM swaps. Terpin filed a $224 million lawsuit against U.S. telecoms provider AT&T for negligence that led to the loss of around $24 million in cryptocurrency holdings. The victim is understood to be the co-founder of an angel group of Bitcoin investors known as BitAngels.\nTerpin filed a 69-page report with the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles against AT&T because the $24 million theft was a result of the \u201cdigital identity theft\u201d of his cell phone account. In the papers, Terpin accuses AT&T of cooperating with the hacker, gross negligence, violation of statutory duties and breaking the commitments of its privacy policy.\nThe victim described the telecom company\u2019s behavior \"like a hotel giving a thief with a fake ID a room key and a key to the room safe to steal jewelry in the safe from the rightful owner.\u201d Terpin is looking for $24 million in compensation from AT&T, as well as $200 million in punitive damages.\nIn January 2019, Terpin also set his sights on Truglia, whom his legal team has identified as the primary suspect in the SIM swap. Truglia and a group of accomplices are alleged to have carried out the SIM swap that led to the theft of $24 million worth of cryptocurrencies.\nCombatting SIM swapping\nThe prevalence of SIM swapping and the amount of media coverage on the subject has made many people aware of the threat this poses to their privacy, data and financial assets. Nevertheless, knowledge of the subject can only do so much to stem the amount of these crimes being carried out.\nAs Malanov tells Cointelegraph, the onus is primarily on mobile operators and banks to protect the credentials of their users and clients. He suggests that, should a SIM be swapped by an operator, all SMS communications should be blocked for a short period of time to protect the user, as is done by all mobile operators in Russia:", "birthday": "2019-02-12T12:58:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-12 12:58:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 12}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/major-crypto-exchanges-launch-otc-desks-despite-the-crypto-winter", "title": " Major Crypto Exchanges Launch OTC Desks Despite the Crypto Winter ", "content": "Institutional investment is increasingly being seen as the future of crypto trading, with both Binance and Bittrex\u00a0launching their own dedicated over-the-counter (OTC) desks in January. The desk launches come after Morgan Stanley\u00a0published a bullish report\u00a0in November, showing a strong pattern of institutional investment for Bitcoin. The latest developments indicate that some of the world\u2019s largest exchanges are receiving increased demand from institutional investors, for whom OTC represents a lucrative opportunity. Cointelegraph takes a look at the latest launches and OTC news.\nBinance launches dedicated OTC desk\nOn Jan. 23, the number-one ranked cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced the launch of its over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk in a blog post on its website. This new service, known as Binance OTC, will allow service users to carry out transactions larger than the equivalent of 20 BTC ($69,552).\nOfficials explained the basic premise of the new service in a blog post:\n\u201cOur OTC desk allows Binance users to trade larger amounts of many cryptocurrencies listed on the exchange, with transactions being settled via their Binance accounts.\u201d\nAs per the post, officials also hoped to draw potential customers to their service by promising trades of large quantities of different cryptocurrencies that will clear at the same price simultaneously. The blog post also sought to reassure prospective clients by adding that trades are private due to the fact that order books will not be touched. Service users will also be able to use direct settlements for OTC trades, without needing to use different wallet addresses.\nThe product launch comes on the back of strong gains being made by Binance Coin (BNB), which now ranks as the 12th-largest coin by market capitalization. The company recently rebranded Trust Wallet as a multi-cryptocurrency wallet, adding an additional 14 blockchains.\nBittrex launches OTC desk after increased client demand\nAnother company to recently launch an OTC desk is United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex. The firm will offer investors seeking to conduct larger trades the opportunity to trade the same 200 crypto assets available to users on its standard platform. Unlike users of the standard service, OTC investors will have to be able to commit to minimum trades of $250,000 or more.\nAccording to Bittrex CEO Bill Shihara, the launch of the desk is a result of increasing demand for an OTC service from its customer base:\n\u201cThis offering will be another way for Bittrex to further advance adoption of blockchain technology worldwide, while also providing our customers with price certainty and a fast and easy way to trade large blocks of digital assets.\u201d\nBittrex Chief Strategy Officer Kiran Raj told Cointelegraph that the OTC launch is part of Bittrex\u2019s commitment to continually revise its services to suit its customers:\n\u201cWe continuously evaluate and expand our offerings to give our customers a wide range of opportunities for participating in the blockchain industry, and our customers were interested in an OTC service with an extensive selection of digital assets.\u201d\nRegarding the ongoing crypto bear market, Raj remained optimistic both about continued client demand and the possibility of staying afloat in an increasingly competitive market:\n\u201cWe continue to see interest from investors at all levels, and we\u2019re expanding our offerings and services to meet the current and future demand. It really comes down to trust and our extensive selection of digital assets. Bittrex is known for our reliability, security and commitment to compliance, and by combining these core pillars, with our broad selection of innovative blockchain projects, we\u2019re providing customers a unique service that\u2019s tailored to their needs.\u201d\nCircle leads the way with OTC\nDespite the abundance of recent over-the-counter desk launches and a vertiginous fall in crypto prices throughout 2018, cryptocurrency finance firm Circle announced that its OTC desk, Circle Trade, had a notional volume of $24 billion in 2018.\nAccording to the announcement made by the company in a Medium blog post, Circle completed 10,000 OTC trades, with around 600 distinct counterparties across 36 different crypto assets. As per the\u00a0press release, the notional volume equated to roughly $24 billion in notional volume.\nIn light of the group\u2019s increased growth and influence across the crypto market, the firm claims to have \u201cbecome a core liquidity provider to the entire crypto ecosystem.\u201d\nAccording to the company, Circle is now partnered with more than 1,000 institutional clients, such as OTC desks, exchanges, asset managers, token projects and other global endowments. In the press release, Circle indicated that it expects positive growth for institutional adoption:\n\u201cThis year, we anticipate further incremental growth in institutional adoption catalyzed by stablecoin usage, advancements in institutional custody solutions, increasing regulatory clarity particularly in the [United States], and improvements and innovation in core crypto infrastructure.\u201d\nCircle Trade\u2019s head of trading, Dan Matuszewski, told Cointelegraph that the so-called crypto winter is behind the current trend for new OTC desk openings:\n\u201cThe crypto winter is forcing companies to look for new opportunities and they\u2019re now realizing what we\u2019ve known for years: OTC trading desks already play an integral role in crypto.\u201d\nDespite the ongoing downward trend in the crypto markets, 2018 was a record year for Circle Trade. Matuszewski said that the company is building on this momentum in 2019:\n\u201cLast year, Circle Trade traded about $24 billion in notional volume and worked with more than 600 distinct counterparties, so we start 2019 from a strong foundation and are seeing steady activity. We onboarded a record number of institutional investors in 2018 and haven\u2019t seen interest dim much relative to the overall trend in crypto markets. Institutional counterparties tend to be more patient and work positions over larger time frames.\u201d\nMatuszewski told Cointelegraph that, although he expects more desk launches in the crypto community, Circle Trade will continue to stand out from the crowd:\n\u201cWe expect to see more desks come onboard as companies recognize the value of offering OTC. Additional desks are likely to be agency and bolted on top of existing crypto businesses, primarily exchanges. The essential difference between us and other OTC desks is we\u2019re able to more quickly meet a customer\u2019s need because we act in a principal capacity, meaning every counterparty faces Circle directly \u2014 we don\u2019t merely act as middlemen waiting to find a buyer or seller on the other side.\u201d\nCoinbase Prime customers gain access to OTC\nIn late January,\u00a0Coinbase announced that selected Prime customers will have access to U.S. and European over-the-counter trading desks and Coinbase custody, a service that focuses on institutional investors and the storage of large amounts of cryptocurrency.\nLaunched in November, Coinbase\u2019s OTC desk permits customers to \u201cexecute large volume trades with minimal price slippage.\u201d According to Christine Sandler, head of sales at Coinbase, the decision to launch the desk stems from increasing demand for OTC trading from institutional clients:\n\u201cWe launched our OTC business as a complement to our exchange business because we found a lot of institutions were using OTC as an on-ramp for crypto trading.\u201d\nThe origins of Coinbase\u2019s OTC trading initiative began on June 6 when President and Chief Operating Officer Asiff Hirji commented\u00a0that the acquisition of a regulatory license would help the company set off on \u201ca path to offer future services that include crypto securities trading, margin and over-the-counter (OTC) trading, and new market data products.\u201d\nIn order to facilitate its transition into securities, Coinbase acquired the securities dealer Keystone Capital Corp., along with Venovate Marketplace Inc. and Digital Wealth LLC in June.\nPoloniex adds OTC service for institutional clients\nU.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex\u00a0also jumped on the institutional bandwagon\u00a0in December. Similarly to Coinbase, Poloniex is actively increasing the number of services it offers to customers. Institutional customers using dedicated accounts on Poloniex\u2019s OTC desk will be able to do so, although the threshold for minimum trades is set at $250,000.\nIn a blog post, the company laid out its offer to institutional clients:\n\u201cInstitutions large and small can enjoy the benefits of our large curated selection of crypto asset trading pairs, dedicated support and robust API services. [...] Poloniex is focused on meeting the advanced trading needs of institutions.\u201d\nHuobi\u2019s OTC desk required to remove Alipay and WeChat payment methods\nMajor Chinese digital payment providers Alipay\u00a0and WeChat have reportedly sent legal letters to the crypto exchange Huobi requesting that the use of both their services and logos on the exchange\u2019s OTC trading desk is unauthorized.\nThe payment methods were available until early February, however, Huobi still has an instructional article explaining how to link Alipay accounts published on its website.\n\nImage source: Huobi\nHuobi responded to the claims from the payment providers, claiming that the company has not received any cease-and-desist letters and stating that the logos represent a payment link. The firm also stressed that there is no official cooperation between the involved parties and confirmed that user transfers are peer-to-peer payments.\nBoth of the payment platforms have litigious pasts when it comes to cryptocurrency. Alipay began to tighten\u00a0its regulations for OTC Bitcoin transactions in August 2018, restricting accounts that used the system to transact Bitcoin OTC and establishing a monitoring system for \u201ckey websites and accounts.\u201d WeChat\u00a0blocked several accounts suspected of publishing initial coin offerings (ICO), along with the official sales channel of the Bitcoin mining behemoth Bitmain\u00a0due to an alleged licence violation.", "birthday": "2019-02-11T16:56:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-11 16:56:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 11}

In describing what the event sets out to achieve, the objective is simple: \u201cHow unique digital assets on the blockchain will transform gaming, licensing, art and finance.\u201d\nThe event will enable attendees to \u201cmeet and hear from some of the biggest names in the collectibles space\u201d \u2014 including Cassidy Robertson from Axiom Zen, the company behind CryptoKitties. During her talk, she plans to chart the platform\u2019s journey so far \u2014 a story that saw the company sell some of its most exclusive kittens for $120,000, and become the largest decentralized app (DApp) on Ethereum in the process.\nOther talks are going to focus on getting mainstream gamers excited about non-fungible tokens, how these assets could reimagine philanthropy, NFTs\u2019 potential in reshaping the sports experience for fans, and the process of tokenizing real-world assets on the blockchain. Dozens of other topics are also up for discussion.\nThe 411 on NFTs\nNon-fungible tokens have attracted interest because they are different from the fungible assets commonly used by the crypto community and the fiat world today. Bitcoin is fungible, as it can be divided into smaller chunks and it is interchangeable. You can buy a fraction of this cryptocurrency if you want to \u2014 and if you were to lend a Bitcoin to a friend, it wouldn\u2019t matter if you received the same one back.\nAll of this changes when it comes to non-fungible tokens, which are often ERC-721-compliant rather than built to ERC-20 technical standards. NFTs can carry unique types of information that make them rare and, in some cases, unlike any other token that\u2019s out there in circulation. They are also sold whole rather than in chunks. Real-world examples could include plane tickets and baseball cards \u2014 and they achieve this non-fungible criteria because half of one cannot be purchased.\nLumi Collect is a crypto wallet for NFTs, and the company has sought to both educate users on its potential while giving them a way to store all of their tokens in one place.\n\nSetting out the opportunities that await the market, Lumi Collect\u2019s CEO, Diana Furman, told Cointelegraph: \u201cProbably, there will be a new class of NFTs that allows for shared ownership and its original value would also be shared. A whole new industry for presenting digital art could emerge. What\u2019s the point in owning a piece of art or another collectible if you cannot display it in a proper way and enjoy what you\u2019ve spent hard-earned money on? NFTs can put an end to the era of digital piracy as they can act as licenses and regulators. Maybe, our digital personalities will be presented on the web as NFT.\u201d", "birthday": "2019-02-12T16:25:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-12 16:25:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 12}

The lawsuit notes that the MCash token was not properly registered with the U.S. securities regulators, and that the investment materials provided to Sun did not accurately represent the token or its terms of purchase.

According to the post, the vulnerability was discovered in March 2018 by one of the Zcash developers. A solution for the problem was covertly included (in order to prevent exploitation by bad actors) in the Sapling network upgrade that was adopted last October. Since the variant of zk-SNARKs that contained the bug was implemented by other projects, Zcash noted that these projects have also taken appropriate actions.\n\nWinklevii vs. Shrem: Judge Rules Twins Must Pay $45,000 in Shrem\u2019s Legal Fees\nA judge has ruled that Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss must pay $45,000 of crypto entrepreneur Charlie Shrem\u2019s legal fees as part of an ongoing lawsuit. In the proceedings, the Winklevoss twins have previously instigated an investigation and asset freeze on Shrem after accusing the entrepreneur of failing to pay back 5,000 BTC from a 2013 trade deal. Shrem\u2019s lawyer has denied the accusations, and a judge has removed the asset freeze. According to media reports, the lawsuit will cover new ground in June.\nBest Cointelegraph Features", "birthday": "2019-02-10T20:14:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-10 20:14:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 10}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nAnalysts are projecting various lower levels on Bitcoin where they anticipate it to bottom out. The number ranges from below $2,000 to about $2,500. Investment and analysis firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, which till a few months back was projecting a target of $15,000 on Bitcoin, has come up with a likely bearish target of $2,270.\nWhile the analysts are busy figuring out the probable bottom and speculating on what can cause the turnaround, Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance has said that the crypto industry needs \u201cmore entrepreneurs to build real projects.\u201d As the fundamentals improve, price will have to follow through to the upside. The recent increase in daily Bitcoin transactions to the same level as January 2018 is a positive sign.\nThe situation in Venezuela shows how cryptos offer a ray of hope for the citizens during a crisis. Following the crisis, Bitcoin trading volume in Venezuela has risen sharply.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) has been sliding lower for the past few days. It has been trading below the 20-day EMA, which shows that the bears have the upper hand. However, the 50-day SMA is still flat, which suggests that the trend in the medium-term is still range-bound.\nThe downtrend will resume on a breakdown of the $3,355\u2013$3,236.09 support zone. The next support on the downside is at $3,000 and below that at $2,600.\nHowever, if the bulls defend the support zone and push prices above the moving averages and the downtrend line, it will indicate a possible reversal. A rally above $4,255 will confirm a double bottom that has a pattern target of $5,273.91.\nWe will wait for the BTC/USD pair to sustain above the downtrend line before suggesting any trade in it. \u00a0\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) is trying to bounce off the critical support at $0.27795. This is the third time the digital currency has visited this level in the past two months. The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone. This shows that the bears have an advantage in the short term.\n\nA break below $0.27795 can result in a drop to $0.24508, below which the downtrend will resume. However, if the XRP/USD pair bounces off the support at $0.27795 and breaks out of both the moving averages, it will indicate a probable bottom. Hence, we might suggest long positions on a breakout and close above $0.33108.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) held on to the bottom of the range on Feb. 6. Currently, the bulls are attempting to rise above the 20-day EMA and the top of the range at $116.30. If successful, it can move up to the 50-day SMA. On clearing $134.50, a rally to the overhead resistance at $167.32 is probable. As the risk-reward is attractive, we recommend long positions on a close (UTC time frame) above $116.30 with a stop loss of $100.\n\nConversely, if the ETH/USD pair fails to break out of the range and turns down from $116.30, it will extend its consolidation. It will weaken and drop towards $83 if the bears break below $103.20. \u00a0\nLTC/USD\nThe bulls defended the support at the moving averages for the past two days and Litecoin (LTC) has surged higher today, reaching close to the overhead resistance of the downtrend line. We anticipate a strong resistance close to $40.784. Hence, a couple of days of consolidation or a minor dip at the current levels cannot be ruled out.\nA breakout of $40.784 will carry the LTC/USD pair to the next resistance at $47.246. We recommend retaining a stop loss on the long positions at $27.50. If the price sustains the higher levels today and extends its up move, we will trail the stops higher.\nConversely, if the bulls fail to sustain the higher level and the pair turns down, it can correct to the support at $33. There are a slew of supports between $27.701 and $33. The trend will turn down on a break below $27.701.\nEOS/USD\nEOS is attempting to bounce from the $2.30 support. A breakout and close above both the moving averages and $2.5944 can result in a rally to $3.05 and above it to $3.2081. Long positions can be initiated on a close (UTC time frame) above $2.5944 with a stop loss below $2.1733.\nIf the EOS/USD pair turns around and slumps below the support at $2.1733, it can fall to $1.7746 and below it to $1.55. The flat moving averages suggest that the pair will continue to consolidate for the next few days.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is range-bound between $105 and $121.30. The next move will start either on a breakout or a breakdown from the range.\nA breakout of $121.30 can push the BCH/USD pair towards the next overhead resistance of $141. Both the moving averages are flat. They point to a consolidation in the short to medium-term.\nConversely, if the bears sink the pair below $105, a fall to $73.50 is possible. Though there is a minor support at $100, we expect it to be broken. The short-term traders can stay on the long side on a close (UTC time frame) above the 20-day EMA, but they should aim for small targets and keep a tight stop. Positional traders can wait for a buy setup to form before jumping in.\nTRX/USD\nTron (TRX) continues to trade inside the symmetrical triangle. For the past two days, the support line of the triangle was defended by the bulls.\nThe TRX/USD pair has to scale the major hurdle at $0.02815521 before it makes a dash to the upside targets of $0.03575668 and above it $0.038.\nAny break of the triangle and the 50-day SMA will be negative and can result in a fall to $0.02113440 and below it to $0.0183. Therefore, traders can keep the stop loss on their long positions at $0.023.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) has been in a strong downtrend. Currently, there is an attempt by the bulls to stage a pullback from deeply oversold levels on the RSI. Overhead, the 20-day EMA, $0.09285498, the downtrend line and the 50-day SMA will act as stiff resistances.\n\nShould the price turn down from any of the resistance levels mentioned above, a retest of the lows and on a breakdown, a drop to $0.05795397 is probable.\nHowever, if the bulls succeed in carrying the XLM/USD pair above the 50-day SMA, a rally to $0.13427059 is likely. As the trend is still down, we shall wait for it to change before suggesting a trade in the pair.\nBNB/USD", "birthday": "2019-02-08T18:30:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-08 18:30:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 8}

Notably, there are just six crypto and blockchain companies featured this year, while the 2018 list contained 11 players from the field.\nGiven that the notorious crypto boom of 2017 has been followed by the relentless bear market, it is hardly surprising. Nevertheless, while there is considerably fewer crypto companies featured this year, less than half of them \u2014 Ripple, BitFury, Coinbase \u2014 have made the list before, which means that new blood arrived regardless of the market condition.\nVeterans\nRipple\nWhat does it do?\nRipple (XRP) is the longest-standing crypto-oriented company on the Forbes list, being recognized for the fifth year in a row. Its main focus is blockchain-powered cross-border remittance payments. Essentially, the San Francisco-based startup aims to overtake SWIFT \u2014 the system that handles as much as $5 trillion worth of transactions per day worldwide \u2014 with faster settlements.\nWhat happened to it in 2018?\nOverall, 2018 was a productive year for Ripple. While the company was burdened with lawsuits claiming that XRP tokens are securities (if proven, the company may face significant fines) and didn\u2019t get listed on Coinbase following prolonged rumors, it succeeded to tap numerous financial institutions \u2014 such as the National Bank of Kuwait (NBK) and Malaysian banking group CIMB \u2014 for its RippleNet network. Moreover, the firm launched blockchain money transfer apps in conjunction with Santander Bank and SBI Holdings.\nFurther, the company hired some senior-level talent: Former Google executive Amir Sarhangi became the startup\u2019s vice president of products, and Kahina Van Dyke, Facebook\u2019s former global director of financial services and payments partnerships, joined the company as senior vice president of business and corporate development. Finally, Ripple continued to team up with universities from across the globe to research blockchain technology, putting over $50 million into academic research.\nBitFury\nWhat does it do?\nBitFury is widely known as the largest non-Chinese mining company, but it was featured on the Forbes for the second year in a row for its endeavours to expand even further, among other reasons. This year, the magazine described the Amsterdam-based startup as a \u201cfull-service blockchain firm.\u201d\nWhat happened to it in 2018?\nNotably, BitFury collaborated with big four consulting firm PwC to create a blockchain accelerator for businesses in Russia. It was also revealed that PwC had already been using Exonum \u2014 BitFury\u2019s open source framework for building blockchain applications \u2014 for educational courses and seminars.\nMoreover, rumors emerged that the startup was planning to go public, reviewing London, Amsterdam and Hong Kong as the host city for a potential initial public offering (IPO). BitFury also advanced on the self-regulatory field, unveiling its software stack Crystal designed to help fight crimes involving Bitcoin (BTC), and tapping a former United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) member to its advisory board. Finally, the firm didn\u2019t forget its roots, having launched a new generation of its BTC mining hardware.\nCoinbase\nWhat does it do?\nSimilarly, Forbes praised Coinbase \u2014 a major U.S. Bitcoin wallet and retail exchange \u2014 for its moves beyond its usual line of work. The company was listed now for the third year in a row.\nWhat happened to it in 2018?\nIn what seems one of the main achievements for the company from last year, Coinbase launched over-the-counter (OTC) trading for institutional customers, rolled out an educational program and acquired Earn.com, a blockchain-powered paid messaging service. Moreover, the company listed its first stablecoin in collaboration with Circle, another Forbes-listed crypto startup and announced plans to expand to the Japanese market.\nNewcomers\nCircle\nWhat does it do?\nCircle is a Goldman Sachs-backed, Boston-based startup focused on making instant money transfers that also offers an insured Bitcoin wallet. The company was featured on Forbes\u2019 \u201cFintech 50\u201d for the first time this year.\nWhat happened to it in 2018?\nIndeed, the past months were especially productive for Circle, which launched its Ethereum-based, dollar-pegged stablecoin in collaboration with Coinbase, and went as far as to fully purchase U.S. crypto exchange Poloniex for $400 million.\nGemini\nWhat does it do?\nGemini, the Winklevoss brothers\u2019 crypto exchange, also debuted on the Forbes list. Having chosen compliance as its main policy, the platform has been pushing the boundaries of the U.S. regulatory framework.\nWhat happened to it in 2018?\nAfter becoming the first official Bitcoin billionaires in Dec. 2017, the Winklevii were off to a jumpstart last year. After hiring a few Wall Street executives to seek institutional investment, the startup launched its own stablecoin with the approval of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), and now continues its quest to land a SEC-approval BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) \u2014 a potential game changer for the industry.\nMost recently, the twins\u2019 company successfully finished its major audit, becoming the first crypto exchange and custodian to complete a Service Organizational Control (SOC) 2 Review by Deloitte.\nAxoni\nWhat does it do?\nEnterprise-focused, New York-based blockchain startup Axoni is perhaps the least recognized newcomer on the crypto part of the Forbes list. The firm is focused on building blockchain solutions for capital markets, and has struck several partnerships with major financial institutions, as per the magazine.\nWhat happened to it in 2018?\nWhile there is little information on the startup available online (at least, compared to the other nominees), its August funding round didn\u2019t go unnoticed. It was led by Goldman Sachs and other high-profile banks and venture capital investors, and allowed Axoni to secure $32 million. As Forbes puts it, the startup \u201cis currently putting the $10 trillion credit derivative market onto smart contracts working with DTCC and a steering committee of 15 of world's biggest banks.\u201d\nWho was left out this year?", "birthday": "2019-02-09T17:05:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-09 17:05:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 9}

With information coming through sporadically, current NEM Foundation President Alexandra Tinsman confirmed to one particularly vocal community member, Jelin1984, that they have to cover all their bases legally before releasing additional information.\n\u201cPlease know I understand how confusing things look and we are working to communicate all information to you and the community in a timely manner. Part of this means we have to take extra steps to ensure we are legally and correctly sharing information \u2014 this takes time to do.\u201d\nNEM Foundation background\nThe NEM foundation was started in 2017, two years after the launch of NEM (XEM), an out-of-the-box, enterprise-grade blockchain platform. It is based in Singapore and in charge of developing and promoting NEM. According to its website, the sole purpose of the foundation is to introduce, educate and promote the use of the NEM blockchain technology platform on an international scale to all industries and institutions.\nNEM co-founder Lon Wong was the founding president of the NEM Foundation until his resignation in early April 2018.\nSince April 2018, Kristof Van de Reck served as the interim president of the NEM Foundation until Alexandra Tinsman was voted in as president on Dec. 14, along with newly elected members of the executive committee and council.\nOnly eligible NEM members can vote in NEM council elections. To become eligible, individuals need to be a minimum of 21 years old, pay the annual membership fee ($50 for individuals/$500 for corporations with fewer than 25 employees/$1,000 for corporations with 25 or more employees) and comply with certain Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements.\nThe 2018 NEM Foundation election process didn\u2019t go smoothly either, as confirmed in a post-election message from then-Interim President Kristof Van de Reck.\nOnly 202 membership accounts were white-listed to vote, the most common reason for membership applications failing being KYC issues and tainted memberships. Some membership applications were refused to due to human error, there were issues with the registration site not being able to accept new membership application sign-ups, the NEM Medium account (where most of the election guides were housed) was suspended midway through the voting process, and there were issues with the Ledger Nano wallet that forced some members to vote manually.\nOf the 202 eligible voters, only 148 voted, due in part to the issues mentioned above.\nAlthough Tinsman repeatedly stated that the NEM Foundation operates as a separate entity to the NEM blockchain platform, the actions of the NEM Foundation have an undeniable impact on the price of XEM, as pointed out by community member Dan_V.\n\u201cI understand that the Foundation is not NEM, however it seems to have an uncanny ability to cripple most parts of it \u2013 whether that is through infighting, unprofessional behaviour by representatives of the council or just lack of direction for NEM as a whole.\u201d\nThe announcement on Jan. 31, 2019 wiped more than $65 million from the XEM market cap in one day.\n\nHow did the NEM Foundation get into such deep financial difficulty?\nThe announcement touched upon some surface level reasons that led to the foundation\u2019s current financial problems, including misaligned goals from key staff members, efforts being duplicated, inconsistent success metrics, little accountability for funds and a questionable return on investments (ROI). As a result, the foundation burned through 9 million XEM per month (approximately $350,000).\nThe \u201cCrypto Winter\u201d was another given reason, pointing to the long cryptocurrency bear run that saw billions being wiped off the crypto market as a whole since January 2018. However, community members took a more accusatory tone.\nJelin1984 accused ex-NEM Foundation President and NEM co-founder Lon Wong of taking some of the funds to develop another crypto project called ProximaX. The accusation is complicated by the fact that NEM and ProximaX continue to have a very close working relationship. In additional information released by the NEM Foundation, it also came to light that 80 million XEM (approximately $3.1 million) was spent between December 2017 and January 2019. Wong was president of the foundation for four of those months. Both Tinsman and Wong deny the accusations.\nIn a separate blog post, Wong addressed the whole issue:\n\u201cDuring my term as NEM Foundation President, I, along with the rest of the NEM Foundation Council, managed our funds prudently. We requested for only 50% of the fund that was approved to be spent for 2017.\u201d\nTinsman addressed the accusation directly in the community forums.\n\u201cNo one is accusing Lon of taking funds. Please don\u2019t spread this misinformation. Lon Wong was a co-founder and the first President of the NEM Foundation which started in early 2017, two years after the launch of NEM. Lon left the NEM Foundation in April of 2018. Since that time he has been focusing on a project called ProximaX, in which is he the President. The NEM Foundation wishes Lon and ProximaX success in the future.\u201d\nAnother community member, Jleony, accused foundation staff of using funds for personal enjoyment and profit:\n\u201cSo sad, people [NEM Foundation employees] were using the fund for personal enjoyment and profit without regards to the project\u2019s success.\u201d\nAgain, Tinsman was forced to address the accusations:\n\u201cHi, this is not true. No one was using the funds for personal enjoyment. There weren\u2019t effective policies put in place in 2017 and 2018 that captured all data spend BUT from the records we do have, we can see that funding was mainly spent on marketing, events, salaries, travel and trainings. We have shared complete transparency with the devs on all the auditing from 2018. This is why the new NEM Foundation restructure was immediately put into place. The new policies and moving to a product-focused structure offers complete transparency to the community on how funds will be spent and allocated.\u201d\n\u201cWe can solve this.\u201d\nThe good news, according to the announcement, is that the NEM foundation\u2019s current financial and operational problems are fixable.\nTo do this, they have proposed a number of drastic changes to how the foundation is run and what its operational focus should be:\n\u201cSo here\u2019s where we currently stand. We have completely rebuilt the NEM.io Foundation\u2019s operating structure and mission. We are hitting refresh and starting from scratch. This means a new focus under this new leadership and a NEM Foundation that truly exists to serve and support its powerful community.\u201d\nThey are changing from a decentralized promotional organization, with regional teams that had a great deal of freedom, to a product-focused organization with more traditional lines of reporting. Foundation employees and contractors will now have to report to one of the seven product heads \u2014 which include a chief technology officer, chief of product management, chief financial officer, chief business development officer, chief operations officer, chief marketing officer and chief revenue officer.\nIn the spirit of transparency and accountability, the product heads will then have to report metrics and deliver ROI directly to the council and community. All funds spent will reportedly flow through the head of finance (CFO) and adhere to accounting standards.\nThe foundation will also be making drastic budget cuts, which include reducing the previous burn rate of 9 million XEM per month by 60 percent, putting all partnerships and projects on hold until further notice, and reducing the 150-strong staff headcount through planned layoffs.\nAll the changes are in an effort to move the foundation from promotional driven organization, including marketing and training, to a more traditional, centralized business model, driven by revenue and product development.\nPlans have also been revealed to raise additional funding of 160 million XEM (approximately $6.2 million) through a proposal to the community \u2014 i.e., asking the NEM community to plug the funding gap.\nNEM Foundation President Alexandra Tinsman has confirmed that a full report of the restructure and funds being requested is in its final stages of preparation and will be released to the community as soon as the core developers and legal teams have had time to review the proposal and audits.\nUpdate: NEM Foundation community to vote on funding request of 210 million XEM ($8 million)\nA proposal for a funding request of 210 million XEM (currently $8.4 million) has been finalized and put forward to the NEM community on Feb. 5, 2019. The vote on whether or not the proposal should go forward will be open for five days, starting on Feb. 15, 2019 at 6 p.m. CST and closing on Feb. 20, 2019 6 p.m. CST.\nFor the vote to be valid, there must be a minimum of 3 percent Proof-of-importance (POI) voting (\u201cYes\u201d POI votes only), and for the proposal to be passed, there must be a majority of 65 percent \u201cYes\u201d votes.\nIf the funding request is approved, funds will be taken either from NEM Foundation\u2019s Marketing, Unconventional Marketing, Operations 1 or Operations 2 funds. According to information shared by NEM Foundation council member and head of Latin America Pedro Gutierrez, there is a combined 3,429,021,123 XEM ($137.9 million) left in the various reserve funds. This funding request would be around 6 percent of that. \u00a0\nThe proposal also states that, should the request be approved, the funds will be used to:\n\nMaintain the NEM Foundation\u2019s operations from Feb. 20, 2019 to Feb. 20, 2020.Implement the new proposed team and organizational structure.Use the existing budget to clear unpaid invoices, employee\u2019s contracts, miscellaneous expense and start afresh.\nIn addition, there will be a reduction of 64.05 percent of the previous year\u2019s budget and a 69 percent reduction in staff.\nIf, however, the funding request is unsuccessful, the foundation will likely be closed.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nOver the past few days, we saw individual cryptocurrencies charting their own course, deifying the absolute leadership of Bitcoin (BTC).\nTron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB) are two of the major cryptocurrencies that leaped ahead while Bitcoin continued to languish in a tight range. This shows that the traders are not waiting for Bitcoin to lead the market out of its crushing bear phase.\nBitcoin has been trading in a tight range for the past few weeks, with many speculating that it will eventually break down, as it did in mid-November of last year.\nHowever, positive comments by Robert J. Jackson Jr., the United States Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) only Democratic commissioner, on the possibility of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) getting the green light from the regulator have soothed sentiment.\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin\u2019s hash rate rose to its highest level in three months, which could have prompted a few bears to book profits, resulting in a sharp spike.\nMost of the gains of today\u2019s top performers came on Feb. 7. Let\u2019s ascertain whether the sudden spurt has changed the trend, or it is only a dead cat bounce that will fizzle out in a few days.\nLTC/USD\nThe investors cheered the news of Litecoin (LTC) Foundations\u2019 partnership with software development firm Beam to explore a new protocol called \u201cMimblewimble\u201d that will improve privacy and scalability.\nLitecoin jumped to the fourth position by market capitalization following the spike on Feb. 8. Has the cryptocurrency turned the corner and is on its way up, or is this just a flash in the pan that will die down quickly? Let\u2019s look at the charts to find out.\n\nThe sharp uptick in the price has pushed the LTC/USD pair above the first resistance of the downtrend line. It is currently at the 20-week EMA, above which it will face selling at $47.246. A break out of this is likely to carry the pair to the 50-week SMA at $82.\nIf the bulls sustain above $47.246, it will indicate that the markets have rejected the lower levels and the downtrend is over.\nThe digital currency might either consolidate or extend its recovery. We shall wait for a price to sustain above $47.246 and for a new buy setup to form, before recommending long-term positions. Short-term traders can stay on the long side of the markets.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the bears defend the overhead resistance of $47.246. In such a case, a correction towards $33 will be probable.\nBNB/USD\nAfter the successful sale of the BitTorrent (BTT) token that closed within a few minutes, Binance has announced the sale of the Fetch.AI (FET) token on Feb. 25.\nAll the lucky BTT investors are currently sitting on huge gains. Hence, the interest in the next sale of the FET tokens is likely to be similarly high. Is this a sign of revival of the initial coin offering (ICO) market? It is too early to confirm, but it is certainly a positive sign.\nHow do we expect the Binance Coin to react to these developments? Let\u2019s analyze the charts.\n\nWe had recommended a buy on a close (UTC time frame) above the 20-week EMA in our previous analysis. However, with this week\u2019s surge, the BNB/USD pair has reached close to the overhead resistance zone of $10\u2013$12. Initiating long positions at the current levels doesn\u2019t give us a good risk-to-reward ratio.\nCurrently, the digital currency is trading inside an ascending channel. If the bears defend the resistance line of the channel, we can expect a minor dip next week. The traders can use that dip to initiate long positions with a target objective of $12\u2013$15.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the cryptocurrency below the channel and the support level at $5.50. Therefore, the stop loss for the trade can be kept at $5. \u00a0\nEOS/USD\nThe investors are favoring select cryptocurrencies and EOS is one of them. It has risen by about 17 percent this week, taking the spot of the third-best performer.\nAlthough it is difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for the spike, there have been some positive developments in the cryptocurrency. A new scaling solution called \u201cLiquidApps\u201d is expected to be a game changer for EOS.\n\nThe EOS/USD pair has been trading in a tight range for the past six weeks. The bulls are attempting to form a higher low around $2.1733. On the upside, the zone of $3.2081\u2013$3.8723 is likely to act as a stiff resistance. The 20-week EMA is also located in this zone.\nIf the bulls scale this area, we anticipate a change in trend. The pair is likely to enter into a range and gradually move up to $6.8299. The 50-week SMA is close to this level. The traders can wait for the price to sustain above $3.8723 and initiate long positions with the stop loss placed below $2.1733.\nHowever, if the price turns down from one of the overhead resistances, it will remain range bound. The pair will weaken below $2.1733 and will resume its downtrend below $1.55.\nDASH/USD\nDash has also seen some of the largest gains after the sudden spurt in crypto prices. Does the rise change the trend, or is it just another bull trap that investors should be careful about?\n\nAfter making a yearly low of $56.214, the DASH/USD pair has been attempting to hold above $64 for the past four weeks. A couple of attempts to break the support level have failed. We now expect the bulls to stage a small recovery.\nIf the bulls sustain above $74, a move to $87 will be likely. Above this, the pullback can extend to the resistance zone of $103.261\u2013$113, the upper bound being the 20-week EMA. We expect the pair to pick up momentum after breaking above the 20-week EMA.", "birthday": "2019-02-10T16:06:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-10 16:06:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 10}

ICO Market Decline, Trend Toward Compliance and Other Takeaways ", "content": "Happy Chinese New Year! As the Year of the Yellow Mountain Dog has drawn to a close, it is time to look back at what happened.\nWhile there was a promising start in January 2018, when most altcoins were enjoying their all-time highs, the bear eventually took over, and the market delved into the so-called \u201cCrypto Winter.\u201d Nevertheless, there was good news, too: The United States regulators expressed their desire to stick to \u201cpositive regulation,\u201d while big league investors poured some funds into a number of promising, compliant crypto projects (mostly stablecoins).\nHere is what was happening month-by-month, along with the main takeaways.\nJanuary 2018\nJapanese crypto exchange Coincheck was hacked, overtaking the infamous 2014 Mt.Gox collapse \u2014 an industry-record-breaking $532 million worth of NEM tokens was stolen this time.\nDespite the amount of damage, Coincheck has managed to steadily rebound from the security breach. Soon after the incident, the platform announced plans of working toward refunding all 260,000 victims. Coincheck also closely followed the orders of Financial Services Agency (FSA), the domestic watchdog, and eventually secured a license to operate, becoming a fully compliant agent.\nFebruary 2018\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), America\u2019s two main regulators when it comes to crypto, made positive remarks about the industry before the Senate, making wide adoption and constructive regulation more possible for the market.\nOn Feb. 6, Jay Clayton and Chris Giancarlo, respective heads of both agencies, held a joint meeting, where they argued that \u201cvirtual currencies mark a paradigm shift in how we think about payments,\u201d but remained worried about the uncontrolled nature of ICOs. Giancarlo went as far as to explain the term \u201cHODL\u201d to the Senate.\nMarch 2018\nBig tech companies proceeded to prohibit crypto-related advertisements on their platforms. While Facebook had already introduced its ban back in January, social media giants Twitter and Google followed suit in March, introducing similar action.\nThe blanket bans did some damage to the market. Not only did they deprive industry players of promotional tools, but the also contributed to the stigmatization of cryptocurrencies as a whole.\n\nApril 2018\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced that the bank will no longer provide services to any person or business that deals with cryptocurrencies in what seemed like a de-facto ban introduced within a major market. Although there were some signs of recovery since then, the harsh, Chinese-like regulation has stayed.\nMay 2018\nIn what seemed like an unexpected twist for a blue chip institution, Goldman Sachs executive Rana Yared told The New York Times that Bitcoin \u201cis not a fraud,\u201d and unveiled plans to trade cryptocurrency. That marked an important step on Wall Street\u2019s path to the crypto market.\nJune 2018\nJay Clayton, the chair of the SEC, confirmed that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are not securities since they act as a replacement for sovereign currencies. That comment suggested that the agency won\u2019t investigate into the latter\u2019s initial coin offering (ICO) and deem it as unregistered, which would potentially result in large fines and penalties. \u00a0\n\nJuly 2018\nJuly proved to be an important month for regulation in the crypto industry, as two separate U.S. congressional hearings centering the matter were held: One by the House Agriculture Committee, and the other by the House Financial Services Committee.\nThe meetings struck completely different tones: While the latter echoed some of the most conservative sentiments regarding the realm of crypto \u2014 with the obligatory call for a blanket ban \u2014 the former appeared more positive, as the board of experts provided the regulators with collected considerations bothering the industry.\nAugust 2018\nCrypto market experienced a major plunge, delving into a full-on bear mode, which still stays as of press time. On Aug. 14, ETH alone shedded as much as 20 percent of its value, while BTC lost its $6,500 support.\nSeptember 2018\nThe SEC requested more comments on its decision about the listing and trading of a BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) created by New York-based firms VanEck and SolidX, which was regarded as one of the top candidates among the community.\nEssentially, the regulator showed it wasn\u2019t going to make any decisions on BTC ETFs in 2018, therefore prolonging the hypothetical arrival of Wall Street\u2019s money.\n\nOctober 2018\nMajor U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase launched the stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) in collaboration with Goldman Sachs-backed startup Circle, making it the first stablecoin for trade on the platform.\nOverall, stablecoins attracted a lot of institutional capital throughout 2018 because of their immunity toward volatility, one of conventional institutions\u2019 main fears regarding the crypto market.\nNovember 2018\nA Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network update resulted in a complex battle, and its blockchain was split into two as a result, with BCH ABC and BCH SV being located on opposing corners of the ring.\nThe latter\u2019s proponents, represented by the likes of Roger Ver and Bitmain\u2019s Jihan Wu, stood for the idea that the basic structure of BCH \u201cdoes not need any radical change.\u201d BCH SV allies, on the other hand, lead by Craig Wright, the self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto, attempted to restore \u201cthe original Satoshi protocol.\u201d\nThe BCH ABC camp eventually secured the original \u201cBCH\u201d ticker on the majority of digital assets platforms, winning the so-called \u201chash wars.\u201d Nevertheless, Bitcoin SV lived on as well, and is currently the 11th-largest currency as of press time, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\nDecember 2018\nBloomberg reported on Facebook\u2019s potential expansion into the stablecoins market. More specifically, according to the news agency, the social media giant is developing a stablecoin for WhatsApp users. The cryptocurrency will reportedly be used for money transfers made within the messaging app and will focus on the Indian market.\nThe move seems somewhat controversial for Facebook, given that the platform has banned cryptocurrency-related ads across its network and then partly backpedaled on it in the past. Nevertheless, if Facebook confirms the news, the crypto market is expected to gain a lot of relevance for the mainstream financial world.\n\nJanuary 2019\nThe start of 2019 was not optimistic, as the crypto winter continues. On Jan. 28, Bitcoin lost its $3,500 support and stayed mostly below that line for the next week. However, around Feb. 9, it climbed up above the $3,600 mark, while the rest of the market also turned green, showing strong signs of reversal.\n\nNow let's take a look at the main things that happened in separate parts of the market \u2014 from ICOs to mining.\nICO market might have died \u2014 or at least went into a coma\nThe ICO market, which was famously booming throughout 2017, took a serious hit.\nEven though ICOs raised the record amount in 2018 \u2014 $8.27 billion, which is twice as much as in the previous year \u2014 the number of coin offerings has been falling since Q1. Moreover, the majority of gathered funds were secured by just two projects: blockchain protocol EOS ($4.2 billion) and messaging app Telegram ($1.7 billion).\nThere might be a number reasons for the decline. First, the regulators stepped in and questioned the legitimacy of ICOs as a fundraising model. As a result, there has been a \u201ccascade of uncertainty,\u201d associated with the ICO token classification. According to a December statement from the SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, ICOs are currently operating in a way that grants significantly less investor protection compared to more traditional markets.\nIndeed, according to a joint investigation published by Yahoo Finance and Decrypt Media in October 2018, the SEC had expanded its crackdown on ICOs, putting \u201chundreds\u201d of projects at risk. The watchog reportedly found that a great deal of startups had violated securities laws during the fundraising stage, and pressured them to \u201cquietly agree\u201d to refund investors\u2019 money and pay fines.\n\nAlso, ICOs have been somewhat stigmatized by the big tech companies, which chose to ban ICO-related ads on their platforms this year. Facebook was first, having prohibited coin offering ads back in January. Later, social media giants Twitter and Google followed suit.\nMoreover, ICOs seem to be heavily cashing out as the year comes to a close. As per data from software development firm Santiment, ICO startups had been transacting ETH at breakneck speed, with over 400,000 ETH moving out of wallets during late November to early December.\nIn a December interview with Bloomberg, Michael Novogratz declared that \u201cthe ICO market is pretty much dead right now.\u201d He added, however, that \u201cthe SEC doesn\u2019t want to kill this innovation\u201d and that he expects a market for regulated security tokens in the U.S.\nHe explained that security tokens \u201caren\u2019t things that go from $1 to $1,000\u201d but are instead \u201cthings that yield 14 percent\u201d that will be sold to qualified buyers. \u201cThat sounds a heck of a lot less sexy, but you\u2019re going to see that business grow,\u201d he concluded. Indeed, more regulation-oriented fundraising models, like initial public offerings (IPOs), might be next to carry the torch.\nMining became a big boy\u2019s business\nIn December, AMD\u2019s popular Radeon RX580 graphics processing unit (GPU), which has been widely used by crypto miners, was reported as being sold for $179.99. In comparison, the same GPU unit cost $550 in February, meaning that it has seen a 67 percent price drop throughout the bearish year. Similarly, Nvidia experienced a massive sell-off of its shares in Q4 2018, cutting the stock price by 54 percent due to the drastic decrease in crypto mining\u2019s profitability.\nIndeed, as Cointelegraph previously reported, the year-long bear market has had a significant effect on the crypto mining industry, with dramatic drops in revenue forcing many miners to quit the industry and sell off their equipment. Some miners have even started selling mining devices by the kilogram in an effort to recoup losses as their rigs reach \u201cshutdown prices.\u201d\n\nMining industry professionals switched over from GPU to custom ASICs (as per December, just two mining rigs remain profitable), and large mining pools akin to the Chinese outfit Bitmain and European mining firm Bitfury have taken over smaller-scale miners. Both of the mining companies are now looking to go public and hence further cement their position within the industry.\nCompliance became cool\nDuring the Year of the Dog, the market started its steady shift from the unregulated, Wild West-like era to a regulated ecosystem recognized by large financial institutions.\nWhile most countries are still struggling to roll out definite regulatory frameworks or concrete central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects, the SEC and CFTC came in with an iron fist and started to prosecute bad actors.\nHaving recognized that the rules have changed, new projects on the crypto market are being designed to comply with the law from the very start. Thus, some of most anticipated announcements in the industry include approval of ETFs, which could push crypto toward broader recognition on Wall Street and arrival of Intercontinental Exchange\u2019s (ICE) virtual currency platform Bakkt.\nSimilarly, stablecoins, which tackle volatility \u2014 one of the cryptocurrencies\u2019 chief dilemmas \u2014 without compromising their core values ensured by blockchain, seem to attract a significant portion of investment from big league players such as IBM, Andreessen Horowitz and Peter Thiel. Even Facebook is rumored to be developing its own stablecoin at this point.\n\n\u201cBlockchain over Bitcoin\u201d became the traditional market\u2019s favorite view toward crypto", "birthday": "2019-02-10T17:15:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-10 17:15:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 10}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-mit-joined-ethereum-in-the-race-for-the-first-pos-blockchain", "title": " How MIT Joined Ethereum in the Race for the PoS Blockchain ", "content": "As\u00a0reported by Cointelegraph on Jan. 24, the press service of the Massachusetts Technical Institute (MIT) announced the development of a new cryptocurrency design\u00a0based on the proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol.\nEthereum \u2014 Algorand\u2019s closest competitor, according to the existing estimates \u2014 will launch its PoS system sometime between 2019 and 2021. Scheduled updates required for a gradual transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) to a PoS algorithm have been regularly postponed by the Ethereum Foundation due to network vulnerabilities and failures in the process of the network\u2019s upgrade.\nTrilemma: It's all about scalability\nThe term \u201ctrilemma\u201d was first\u00a0used by Vitalik Buterin when referring to the phenomenon when only two of the following parameters can be achieved at the same time within the framework of the blockchain \u4e00 security, decentralization and scalability. If the first two qualities successfully coexist in the current state of the blockchain, the final one has not yet been achieved.\nThe fact is that the current blockchain system is designed in such a way that each node stores information about the entire network and processes all transactions. This mechanism provides a maximum degree of security but, at the same time, reduces scalability. The blockchain cannot process more transactions than is processed by a single node. That is why Bitcoin currently processes about three to seven transactions per second (TPS), and Ethereum about seven to 15 TPS.\n\nEthereum\u2019s perspective on the scalability\n\nIn order to find a solution, the Ethereum team has developed an entire roadmap, which provides a framework to gradual transition to a PoS consensus within the Casper project, as well as Ethereum's layer one and layer two solutions.\nThe layer one is represented by sharding, which splits the global network nodes into groups (segments), so each group of nodes has the same bandwidth as the current Ethereum network. Then they are connected to each other through cross-references, so the network remains unified and receives almost unlimited scaling opportunities, depending only on the total number of full-featured network nodes. Development of the layer one includes channels similar to the Lightning Network, such as the Raiden Network and the model of the \u201cchildchain,\u201d or sidechain, on which the Plasma solution is based.\nThe complexity of these mechanisms, as well as the fact that some of these changes, especially intra-network adjustments of protocols, require coordination between the relatively large user base and Ethereum developers, have caused the launch dates of the various phases of the roadmap to be postponed several times, with developers reconsidering the security settings.\nAlgorand\u2019s take on scalability\n\nAlgorand intends to get ahead of Ethereum and release pure PoS later this year. The new cryptocurrency design \u2014 named Vault \u2014 will work on the basis of the Algorand blockchain, which was first\u00a0presented at the Financial Cryptography and Data Security Conference on April 4, 2017.\nThe author of the solution is Silvio Micali, a professor at the MIT and recipient of the Turing Award, who, in 1982, together with Shafi Goldwasser, created the first public-key probabilistic encryption system. According to Micali, trilemma is false:\n\u201cThe trilemma is false. The fact that 2000+ prior blockchain projects could not simultaneously be secure, scalable and decentralized is not proof that achieving all these three properties is impossible. \u00a0Algorand exists to solve this exact challenge and we are advancing the limits of blockchain by means of technological breakthroughs like our pure of proof stake algorithm.\u201d\n\nData storage and bandwidth\nThe creators of Vault and Algorand promise users that they will not have to download the entire blockchain to their computer. This requires only a small part of the information about operations in the network.\n\u201cWith Vault, a blockchain compression technology, we want to make sure that Algorand will avoid the storage and bandwidth costs associated with other blockchain protocols, which in turn make it a more viable blockchain solution for companies to adopt. The most exciting parts of Vault are that it frees up local storage on nodes, distributes the storage costs of the Algorand blockchain across different parts of the network by sharding (without sacrificing security), and reduces the bandwidth required to join the network by allowing new nodes to avoid checking every block since day one.\u201d\nThe technical presentation of the project\u00a0prepared by MIT states that the Vault\u2019s block size is 10 megabytes, which is equivalent to 10,000 transactions, and each block contains a hash of the previous block. For comparison, to verify transactions in the Bitcoin network today, the user must download 500,000 blocks with a total data volume of about 150 gigabytes. At the same time, MIT assumes that it is required \u201cto keep all account balances in order to check new users and ensure that they have enough funds to complete the transactions.\u201d\nTo reduce the amount of stored data, Vault applies a special principle of data separation. Vault\u2019s blockchain, like Bitcoin, stores transactions in a Merkle tree, but it is divided into fragments assigned to different groups of users. Each of them needs to store transactions only from its fragment and root hashes. For verification of transactions outside the assigned fragment, a special method has been developed for searching a group of nodes that intersect the entire tree. So, there is no need to check all the blocks from the very beginning.\nEthereum developers plan to scale the PoS network with the interaction of two layers \u4e00 sharding and Plasma, in which, according to Buterin, it will be possible to conduct tens of thousands of transactions per second.\n\u201cIf you add 100x from Sharding and 100x from Plasma, these two together basically give you a 10,000x scalability gain.\u201d\nThe Ethereum foundation suggests a PoS blockchain model in which nodes can work in parallel \u2013 \u201cshardchain.\u201d\nThe model is quite similar with the one used by Algorand, and implies that each node has to carry a small part of data in order to complete a transaction \u2014 and each shardchain is a separate blockchain having separated accounts, state and transactions.\n\u201cImagine that Ethereum has been split into thousands of islands. Each island can do its own thing. Each of the islands has its own unique features and everyone belonging on that island, i.e. the accounts, can interact with each other and they can freely indulge in all its features. If they want to contact with other islands, they will have to use some sort of protocol.\u201d\nIn order to achieve high bandwidth, Ethereum plans to process part of the transaction outside the blockchain by means of its second layer, Plasma.\nPlasma may be regarded as a childchain that could run entire applications featuring thousands of users with minimal interaction between it and the Ethereum mainchain. However, this childchain would also be able to produce its own childchains, essentially creating numerous branched blockchains, all of which are connected to the mainchain. Since operations on those sub-chains won\u2019t have to be replicated across the entire mainnet, they could move a lot faster and reduce transaction fees.\nUnlike similar solutions from other projects \u2014 for example, EOS \u2014 Algorand will work on a pure PoS system, Micali said:\n\u201cAlgorand's consensus model is a Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPOS) model based on a Byzantine agreement protocol. This means that the blockchain is distributed and fault tolerant without any form of centralization and will continue to function as long as more than two thirds of the currency is in honest hands.\u201d\nThe secret is in the use of\u00a0a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) \u2014 created by Micali back in the 1990s \u2014 which performs a secret cryptographic sortition to select committees to run the consensus protocol. This allows the Algorand blockchain to reach the scale and performance necessary to process transactions of millions of users.\n\u201cEssentially, when a new block is proposed to the blockchain, a committee of \u2018voters\u2019 is selected to \u2018vote\u2019 on the proposed block. If more than two-thirds of the \u2018votes\u2019 are cast by honest users, then the block is deemed valid and will be certified. Committee members are chosen based on the number of algos they have. Committees are made up of randomly selected accounts with voting power dependent on their online stake.\u201d\nWill the trilemma be solved?\nDespite the repeated delay of the Constantinople release \u2014 a fundamental intermediate update on the road to PoS \u2014 Afri Johnson, an Ethereum developer,\u00a0assumes that Ethereum 2.0 and PoS will not be delayed, since they are being worked on by several independent teams and will go live soon:\n\u201cFurthermore, it's important to understand that Proof-of-Stake, the so-called \u2018phase 0\u2019 / the \u2018beacon chain,\u2019 will not be a hardfork, unlike other milestones. We will see beacon chain testnets very soon, within weeks or months. And I expect that we can reach the Serenity milestone within a year, optimistically speaking.\u201d", "birthday": "2019-02-07T14:40:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-07 14:40:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 7}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-based-digital-id-systems-are-increasingly-finding-real-world-use", "title": " Blockchain-Based Digital ID Systems Are Increasingly Finding Real-World Use ", "content": "According to the latest\u00a0estimates, we generate around 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day. That's 2.5 followed by 17 zeros \u2014 or rather 2.5 trillion million \u2014 a number that's impossible to visualize intuitively, but nonetheless has massive implications for our privacy online, our security and our ability to keep our digital identities within our own personal control. Indeed, recent\u00a0surveys indicate that as many as 89 percent of consumers believe that corporations currently aren't doing enough to protect their data, while over half of all CEOs and C-suite executives admit that most consumers are right to doubt them on this.\nGiven the overwhelming scale of this problem, there's little chance it will be resolved overnight. However, as Cointelegraph reported in an\u00a0analysis last year, a growing number of blockchain-based platforms have emerged with the promise of making the data related to digital ID more manageable. Thanks to the emergence of blockchain technology, a new paradigm \u2014 self-sovereign identity \u2014 is now possible, one which is shaping up to provide individuals with direct control over the nuggets of data and the credentials that prove who they are. Organizations such as the Sovrin Foundation, Bloom and Civic are all vying to realize this paradigm, while an expanding range of private and public institutions are now planning to build blockchain-based systems of their own.\nThere is, then, plenty of evidence to indicate that the hype of 2017 and 2018 is now bearing fruit when it comes to blockchain and digital identity. However, as encouraging as it is to see the new blockchain-based platforms actually being used, the sheer profusion of these platforms presents problems of its own, insofar as it could make it harder to arrive at the kind of universal system of digital ID the companies featured in this article are working toward, in which digital ID and personal data isn't siloed.\nUse cases\nBlockchain and digital ID platforms have already come a long way since last year. This is evident in the number of notable organizations that have recently involved themselves in the sector. In January, the Iceland-based ID verification platform Authenteq revealed that it had secured $5 million in a Series A funding round led by Draper Associates \u2014 which, in the past, had invested in Tesla, Skype and Baidu. That same month, the chief executive of the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) stated that it was favorably investigating the idea of using a blockchain-based solution as part of the open-banking ID system it was planning to develop.\n2018 brought other examples of governmental and commercial interest in blockchain-based ID, including from the\u00a0European Union,\u00a0Microsoft, Telefonica and Johnson Controls. For the most part, such interest isn't merely the result of the novelty of blockchain and the hype surrounding it, but rather of the genuine progress a variety of startups and organizations have made in developing their platforms.\nSovrin Foundation's chair, Dr. Phillip Windley, explains to Cointelegraph, self-sovereign identity refers to ID credentials that are held and controlled by the person they identify \u2014 and in Sovrin's case, these credentials are collated from multiple sources, meaning that there is no single centralized source for all of them. \"Sovrin\u2019s approach to identity is based on multi-source identity where identity attributes are vouched for by many credential issuers,\" he says.\n\"Anyone can become a credential issuer. Identity owners can hold credentials from multiple sources and present them to prove things about themselves. Credential verifiers determine which credentials they will trust. This is how identity works in the physical world. Sovrin brings it online.\"\nSince launching at the end of 2016, the Sovrin Foundation has expanded and developed quickly. According to Windley, the \"Sovrin network now boasts stewards on every continent except Antarctica,\" with IBM, Cisco, T-Labs and Swisscom counted among the 60 stewards tasked with running the validator nodes that make the Sovrin ledger work.\n\"The governments of British Columbia and Ontario have created over 6 million credentials representing business registrations and licenses for businesses in those two provinces,\" he explains, while another \u00a0example comes from the development of a platform for credit unions by CULedger, which plans to issue a million credentials in the coming year.\nOther blockchain-based ID platforms have witnessed tangible growth in the past year: Civic signed partnerships with Telefonica and a number of other companies, while United Kingdom-based Nuggets recently signed a deal with Lateral Payment Solutions to bring decentralized ID to the latter\u2019s payment platform. There\u2019s also the credit-scoring and digital ID platform Bloom, which, according to co-founder Ryan Faber, made significant advances in user growth, because its app is attracting bigger organizations as well as individual users.\n\u201cBig corporations are looking toward Bloom as a solution for secure and streamlined lending. Over the last few months, we announced public collaborations with American Express Middle East and BMW Financial Services, among others.\u201d\nOne other company worth mentioning is Lynked.World, a Netherlands-based firm that's using the Ethereum blockchain to provide ID verification, as well as professional and educational verification. In December, it\u00a0produced the first-ever blockchain-based birth certificate to be issued in India, after it secured a partnership with the municipal government of Kolkata. It also has partnerships with a range of state-run companies in the South Asian country, including Coal India Limited, the Metal Scrap Trade Corporation Limited (MTSC) and the West Bengal Forest Corporation Limited, with which it will issue digital ID cards and passbooks in order to mediate between local traders and markets.\nSuch beginnings are still relatively modest, but establishing working relationships with real organizations is furnishing additional proof that there's a genuine appetite for blockchain-based ID solutions, which are trustworthier and more secure than pre-existing alternatives.\nUniversal or \u201csiloed\u201d systems?\nThere is hope that blockchain-based platforms will play an increasingly important role in securing digital ID and personal data in the future. However, since the organizations to which we have to prove our identities are growing so quickly as to stretch into almost every corner of our lives, it's clear that it's still going to take a long time before blockchain-based ID systems become widespread. What\u2019s more, added resistance will be provided by all those platforms and companies that profit from the current system, in which people don\u2019t have control over their personal data.\n\u201cBig companies manipulate data, so they are not very interested in decentralizing this kind of information,\u201d notes Vlad Dobrynin, the CEO and founder of Humans.net, a blockchain-based social network for people to directly trade skills and help. Dobrynin warns that personal data is a highly profitable market, and one that no company or industry would give up without a fight.\n\u201cIn fact, there is a huge shadow data industry worth billions of dollars each year that is absolutely dependent on hoovering up personal data and which many large organizations sell their data into. As such, there will be resistance at this level and no doubt many clever arguments will be put forward as to why personal data gathering and data \u2018analysis\u2019 should continue. However, it ultimately depends on users and a critical mass of startups that use blockchain-based digital IDs to start turning the tide.\u201d\nAs Phillip Windley also argues, network effects will prove key in driving adoption, with startups and organization initially having to push very hard for several years before they reach that all-important tipping point where others are forced to join for fear of being left behind.\n\"Self-sovereign digital identity will grow similar to other platforms with large network effects: slowly at first and then all at once. The production uses [...] use credentialing within an ecosystem: Canadian business licensing, credit unions, and healthcare professionals. Those organizations and others are doing the hard work of getting people used to a new model, building partnerships, and launching systems. But once enough of these exist in isolation, the interaction of these people starts to put pressure on others outside those ecosystems to accept these credentials, or organizations outside these ecosystems start to see how accepting these credentials could save them time or money.\"", "birthday": "2019-02-07T18:53:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-07 18:53:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 7}

Ever since Ross Ulbricht launched the Silk Road online marketplace in February 2011, Bitcoin and its ilk have been disrupting the ability of authorities to police the globe, and to ensure that norms, regulations and laws are being observed. For a while, it was believed by some that smart contracts \u2014 essentially if-then instructions written into and executed by a blockchain \u2014 would do something very similar to the law itself, coming into potential conflict with the globe's legal systems and their jurisdiction over our behavior.\nHowever, in a blog written toward the end of January, law professor Giesela R\u00fchl argued that smart contracts don't necessarily conflict with traditional contract law, and that international law \u2014 specifically the European Union's Rome I Regulation \u2014 applies to them. This was a rare affirmative statement that blockchain-based contracts can be seamlessly integrated into the globe's existing legal frameworks, all without there needing to be a significant overhaul of said frameworks.\nBut while other legal experts agree with R\u00fchl's overall analysis, some question whether it's still too early in the life of smart contracts to conclude that they won't cause problems for the world's existing legal frameworks. What's more, international law encompasses more than just EU contract law, while even within the EU there's still the question of how individual member states will interpret and enact the Rome I Regulation.\nSmart contracts are legal contracts when they\u2019re legal contracts\nThe main claim put forward by R\u00fchl in her blog was that smart contracts are subject to international law, with the Rome I Regulation being the piece of law that determines the legality of all civil and commercial contracts in the EU. More specifically, she contends that Rome I is capable of assigning smart contracts to particular national legal systems, something that will obviously be useful in cases where it's not immediately clear where a smart contract has been in operation.\n\"It will usually be possible to assign a smart contract to a particular legal system because the Rome I Regulation does not rely on the place of formation or the place of performance to determine the applicable law, but resorts to connecting factors, namely party choice and habitual residence, which work reasonably well in a globalised and digitalised society.\"\nFor the most part, other legal experts concur with the main thrust of her analysis. Stephan Meyer and Martin Eckert \u2014 blockchain legal experts at the MME law firm in Zurich and Zug \u2014 tell Cointelegraph that, assuming smart contracts are actually contracts in a legal sense, then international legal frameworks such as the Rome I Regulation do obviously apply to them.\n\"Prof. R\u00fchl has correctly stated that the Rome I Regulation applies only to contractual obligations in a legal sense,\" they say via email. \"Therefore, the decisive question is whether a smart contract can be a contract in a legal sense or not.\"\nPointing out that, generally, \"a smart contract is a computer program recorded on a distributed ledger system executing pre-defined functions,\" Meyer and Eckert nonetheless affirm that three different kinds of smart contracts can be distinguished from a legal perspective, with the first two kinds being subject to the Rome I Regulation (and potentially other instances of international law).\n\"One: smart contracts of which the code directly represents the content and terms of the agreement; in this situation, the smart contract is a direct manifestation of the (legal) contract. Two: smart contracts that are intended to execute bilateral or multilateral contractual agreements made completely or partially outside of the blockchain (in writing, orally or by conduct).\"\nIn other words, a smart contract is legally enforceable if the terms of a legally binding contract are directly written into it, or if there's agreement between the relevant parties that it's intended to uphold and execute such a contract. Otherwise, smart contracts \"are just programs not qualifying as contracts in a legal sense,\" which means that legal frameworks such as the Rome I Regulation do not apply to it.\nNonetheless, Meyer and Eckert state that even if they aren't legal contracts as such, \"smart contracts are not in a legal vacuum.\" What this means is that, despite not legally specifying the terms by which two parties should interact, a smart contract would still be subject to applicable domestic or international laws (not necessarily contract laws) if they resulted in such laws being violated. For example, an informal house party is obviously not a contract, but if someone at that party assaults another guest, then that would constitute an offence under various laws.\nChoosing your law\nAnother key point made by R\u00fchl is that smart contracts are unproblematic for international law also because the principle of party autonomy (a principle used in international arbitration) permits the parties to a (smart) contract to specify the national laws to which that contract will be subjected. As she writes in her blog:\n\"Embodied in Article 3 Rome I Regulation, it [the principle of party autonomy] allows parties to submit their contract to the law they want \u2014 and without requiring a territorial connection to that law.\"\nHowever, there is some dispute over how this principle might be upheld with regard to smart contracts. R\u00fchl states that it's \"hard to see, however, how a choice of law can be represented in algorithmic fashion (\u2018if-this-then-that\u2019).\" She therefore suggests that some kind of supplementary document or agreement will be needed to specify the national law(s) applying to any smart contract, although Meyer and Eckert do not entirely agree with her on this.\n\"Based on the Rome I Regulation, the applicable law is determined through the principle of party autonomy. For most contracts, there is no specific form required for the definition of the terms. Therefore [...], it should be (technically and legally) possible to include a choice of law clause in a smart contract. The parties could even agree on and implement a specific smart contract function that, if executed, replies with the message: \u2018This contract has been construed in accordance with and is governed by Swiss law.'\"\nMeyer and Eckert admit that the choice of law can also be included in an agreement outside of any given smart contract, so either way such contracts don't appear to pose international law with too much difficulty. That said, other legal experts suggest that the decentralized nature of blockchains and smart contracts could make determining a specific jurisdiction for such contracts very difficult. This is the view taken by James Kaufmann, a legal director at the United Kingdom-based professional services firm RPC, who warns that smart contracts may ultimately require an integrated international agreement as to the specific laws that will apply to them.\n\"What a smart contract will often mean is that you\u2019ll have an inherently international arrangement, where you have an arrangement where there is no obvious place for the contract to be domiciled, when neither party is necessarily physically located anywhere, because it's all done through the blockchain or on the cloud and there's no physical location for anything.\u201cAnd if it's a smart contract that doesn't necessarily require any kind of manual execution or signing, and there's no necessary subject of the contract, it's just a confirmation that one piece of data is transferred from one place to another, then there is therefore nowhere where you can 'hang your hat' and say this is where the contract has been carried out.\"\nSimilarly, given the pseudonymous or sometimes anonymous nature of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, there will always remain the possibility that one or more of the parties to a smart contract won't be identifiable. And as Lisa Cheng, the founder of smart contract service provider Vanbex, adds, this will require some adaptation on the part of the law and on that of smart contract platforms.\n\"There will always be difficulty in applying laws to anonymous parties; in general, people will not enter into anonymous agreements (via blockchain or any other method) and expect the law to protect them. But yes, smart contracts can be used in a way that would make legal enforcement difficult or impossible \u2014 the solution is for trusted smart contract platforms to control these sorts of uses.\"\nAs Cheng suggests, anyone who wants to be able to uphold their rights won't enter into a smart contract anonymously, and most likely won't enter into a smart contract with an anonymous party (although this possibly won't always be avoidable). This is something Meyer and Eckert agree with, while still acknowledging that pinpointing the relevant residence and jurisdiction of the parties involved could still be difficult.\n\"Given the decentralised and pseudo-anonymous nature of most blockchain systems, it can be very difficult to determine the closest connection and the place of the characteristic performance. However, the question of the relevant law is usually only then relevant, when two parties disagree on the content of a contract and meet each other before a court (a lawsuit against an unknown person generally makes little sense). In this case, at least the residence of the parties should be known.\"\nInternational and national law", "birthday": "2019-02-08T12:32:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-08 12:32:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 8}

One of its main goals was to solve the \u201cblood diamonds\u201d issue \u2014 i.e., preventing the circulation of diamonds mined in war zones and sold to finance oppressive regimes. Everledger uses grading reports provided by Gemological Institute of America (GIA) for assessing the diamonds. Kemp told Cointelegraph in July 2018:\n\u201cWe do not see ourselves as a crypto company \u2014 and, to be honest with you, we don't even see ourselves as a blockchain company. We're building a platform of provenance to help with transparency, and conflict and opaque markets. And we want to build an ethical trade platform.\u201d\nThe idea of tracking gems is not new \u2014 in 2003, the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) regime was established by a United Nations General Assembly Resolution to increase transparency in the diamond trade and keep conflict diamonds out of the market. Essentially, the process implies that KPCS participants monitor shipments of rough diamonds and certify them as \u201cconflict free.\" More specifically, they follow a series of self-regulatory principles aimed at ensuring that diamonds are bought from legitimate sources. Some of those guidelines are mentioned in the System of Warranties introduced by the World Diamond Council in 2015.\n\nWhile the KPCS scheme has been adopted by more than 80 countries since then, its efficiency has been questioned. In December 2011, international nongovernmental organization (NGO) Global Witness quit the program, arguing that \u201cmost consumers still cannot be sure where their diamonds come from\u201d and criticizing more specific KPCS members\u2019 decisions:\n\u201cThe decision to endorse unlimited diamond exports from named companies in the Marange region of Zimbabwe \u2013 the scene of mass killings by the national army \u2013 has turned an international conflict prevention mechanism into a cynical corporate accreditation scheme.\u201d\nFurther, in December 2017, Canada-based NGO Impact, which monitors the management of natural resources in Africa, also pulled out of the scheme. In an accompanying statement, the NGO\u2019s executive director argued that KPCS \u201cdid not establish a conflict-free and legal diamond supply chain,\u201d instead giving consumers \u201cfalse confidence about where their diamonds come from.\u201d\nDecentralization, on the other hand, and the transparency that it implies, might help the industry evolve further and make sure that self-regulatory precautions are followed.\nAn immutable ledger would allow access to the full account of a particular diamond\u2019s history and eliminate the possibility of forging documents, as every milestone of the gem\u2019s destination would be recorded on the blockchain, according to representatives of Alrosa, a Russian partially state-owned diamond mining company that reportedly handles around 27 percent of global diamond production by volume:\n\"Creating a blockchain-based tracing system is another step towards ensuring the transparency of the industry. Blockchain could allow to track each stone's history, from its extraction to the final purchase. This greatly lowers the chances of any unfair or wrongful transaction for both consumers and resellers. Such transactions may include purchase of fake or synthetic stones under the guise of natural ones, sale stones with overstated specifications or blood diamonds coming from conflict areas.\u201d\nBlood diamonds are not the only issue, as gem retailers are also trying to detect laboratory-grown diamonds, which are less valuable among customers, and sometimes are sold as natural ones.\n\nSynthetic diamonds. Image source: GIA\nMajor diamond industry participants adopt blockchain \u2014 Alrosa, De Beers, Chow Tai Fook and others\nIndeed, some of the industry\u2019s largest players \u2014 Alrosa included \u2014 have already collaborated with blockchain-based platforms to introduce DLT solutions for a conflict-free, responsible diamond trade.\nIn September 2018, major Hong Kong-based retailer Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group joined the Everledger project with its GIA grading reports to boost the sales of the T MARK line, in which the diamonds are inscribed with traceable codes so that their origin can be checked.\n\u201cWe announced our collaboration with GIA in May last year to use blockchain to enhance our offering and add an additional layer of trust for consumers of T MARK. The pilot service was later launched to the market in September in the same year,\u201d Peony Sze, spokesperson for Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group told Cointelegraph, adding:\n\u201cSince T MARK already traces a diamond\u2019s entire journey from sourcing to finished jewellery, the blockchain initiative further enhances T MARK by allowing customers to receive both traceability and secure grading information via a single digital platform.\u201d\nSze believes that blockchain\u2019s arrival \u201cis a natural evolution for the diamond industry,\u201d which will eventually be picked up by other players as well:\n\u201cMore and more leading companies in the gem and jewellery industry are developing or using blockchain in different facets of their products and services across the supply chain to enhance customer experience with security and traceability.\u201d\nIn January 2018, De Beers Group \u2014 a large international corporation that specializes in diamond exploration, mining and retail \u2014 introduced an initiative similar to Everledger\u2019s, although on a larger, enterprise scale. The company announced it was looking into blockchain to improve the transparency of the diamond value chain and get permanent digital records for every diamond registered on the platform.\nDe Beers added that an initial proof-of-concept (PoC) trial was successful and resulted in a working prototype. The company\u2019s CEO, Bruce Cleaver, said in a press release:\n\u201cDiamonds hold enduring value and represent some of life\u2019s most meaningful moments, so it\u2019s essential to provide assurance that a diamond is conflict-free and natural. By leveraging blockchain technology, we will provide an additional layer of assurance to consumers and industry participants, with every diamond registered on the platform having a record as everlasting as the diamond itself.\u201d\nIn May 2018, De Beers claimed that they tracked 100 high-value diamonds from the mine to the retailer using blockchain in what was presented as a first for the industry. Additionally, the company announced Tracr, the blockchain-based platform based on the previous PoC efforts and created in conjunction with five leading diamond manufacturers: Diacore, Diarough, KGK Group, Rosy Blue NV and Venus Jewel.\nTracr assigns every diamond it processes with a unique \u201cGlobal Diamond ID\u201d that records its characteristics \u2014 including carat, clarity and color. The data is then recorded onto an immutable digital ledger. Once the data is registered, Tracr verifies it at each milestone of the diamond\u2019s journey, from the mine to the retailer.\n\nThe program will be open to the entire industry, Cleaver said, adding:\n\u201cThe Tracr project team has demonstrated that it can successfully track a diamond through the value chain, providing asset-traceability assurance in a way that was not possible before. This is a significant breakthrough made achievable by the close engagement of the pilot participants who share our commitment to industry progress and innovation.\u201d\nIndeed, Tracr has attracted large participants since then. On Oct. 29, Alrosa joined the project, further escalating the project\u2019s potential for the industry. The Russian firm is reported to be the world\u2019s largest producer of raw diamonds in carat terms; together with De Beers, the two companies produce around half of the world\u2019s supply.", "birthday": "2019-02-06T15:26:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-06 15:26:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 6}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nThe article has been updated to reflect a mistake in the name of the Sheikh involved in the crypto funding, who is Sheikh Saeed bin Ahmed Al Maktoum, not Sheikh Ahmed bin Al Maktoum.\nCryptocurrencies are struggling to move up, even after having been in a bear market for over a year and falling anywhere between 85 and 99 percent from their individual all-time-highs.\nInvestors with open positions are experiencing huge losses, and the ones sitting on the sidelines are scared to enter, as the market continues to make new lows on a regular basis. This has resulted in a drop in trading volumes across crypto exchanges.\nWhile many retail traders are turning away from cryptocurrencies, the same cannot be said about institutional investors. The Private Office of Sheikh Saeed bin Ahmed Al Maktoum, a Dubai royal, is helping cryptocurrency fund manager Invao raise funds in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\nStill, the big players have been slow to enter the nascent market of crypto. None of the institutions have truly committed yet.\nWith no retail investors and no large-scale institutional demand, the markets are reeling and are unable to absorb even a small amount of selling pressure. Let\u2019s see if the prices are likely to turn around from the current levels or are they getting ready to plunge even deeper.\nBTC/USD\nAlthough Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a small range, the sentiment remains bearish. The price continues to trade below both moving averages, and the RSI has been in the negative territory since Jan. 10. The failure of the bulls to scale above the 20-day EMA shows weakness.\n\nThe bears will now try to resume the downtrend by breaking down of the yearly low at $3,236.09. Repeated failure of the BTC/USD pair to stage a decent recovery deters the traders who are waiting to buy upon the confirmation of a bottom. The critical levels to watch on the downside are $3,000, which is more of a psychological support, and below it $2,600.\nConversely, if the cryptocurrency rebounds sharply from the current levels, or from $3,236.09, it can move up to the moving averages and above them to the downtrend line. We shall wait for a trend reversal before recommending a trade.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) has been unable to find any buying support. It is likely to drop to $0.27795 for the third time since mid-December of last year. The 20-day EMA is sloping down, and the RSI is in the negative zone, which shows that the sellers have the upper hand. On a break below $0.27795, the fall can stretch to the yearly low of $0.24508.\n\nOur bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls rebound sharply from $0.27795 and carry the XRP/USD pair above both moving averages. Such a move will signal strength and we might suggest long positions on a close above the 50-day SMA. Until then, we remain neutral-to-bearish on the pair.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) has dropped to the bottom of the range. The downsloping 20-day EMA, and the RSI in the negative zone, show that the sellers have the upper hand. A break below $103.2 will invite further selling that can drag the digital currency to $83.\n\nOur bearish assumption will prove to be wrong if the ETH/USD pair bounces sharply from the current levels and rises above $116.3. We believe that such a move would signal a probable change in trend. Therefore, we propose a long position on a close (UTC time frame) above $116.3. The targets to watch on the upside are $134.5, and above it $167.32.\nEOS/USD\nAfter failing to break out of the 50-day SMA, EOS is likely to drop to the support at $2.1733. Both moving averages are flat, and the RSI is just below the 50 level, which shows that a consolidation between $2.1733 and $2.5944 might continue for a few more days.\n\nContrary to our opinion, if the bears break down of the support at $2.1733, the EOS/USD pair can slide to $1.7746, and below it to $1.55.\nThe cryptocurrency will show first signs of strength after the bulls scale the moving averages and the $2.5944 mark. We shall wait for the price to close (UTC time frame) above $2.5944 before suggesting any long positions.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has been trading inside a tight range of $105\u2013$121.3 since Jan. 28. The 20-day EMA is gradually sloping down, and the RSI is in the negative zone, which shows that the supply is exceeding the demand.\n\nA breakdown of $105 will be a bearish indication that can result in a drop to $73.5. There might be a minor attempt to defend the psychological level at $100, but we don\u2019t expect it to hold.\nConversely, if the BCH/USD pair breaks out of the consolidation, it can move up to $141, where it will be likely to face a stiff resistance. Upon crossing the 50-day SMA, we expect the pair to show strength. Until then, we suggest traders remain on the sidelines.\nLTC/USD\nAfter sustaining above $33 for the past four days, Litecoin (LTC) has again turned down. It is currently at the moving averages, which are likely to offer strong support.\n\nHowever, if the LTC/USD pair breaks down of the moving averages and the small uptrend line, it can slide to $29.349, and below it to $27.701. Below that level, a retest of $23.090 is likely. The traders can keep the stop loss at $27.5.\nOn the upside, $36.428 is the critical level to watch out for. A failure to break out of this level shows a lack of demand at higher levels. Both of the moving averages are flat, and the RSI is at 50 levels, which indicates the possibility of a consolidation in the near term.\nTRX/USD\nTron (TRX) failed to break out and sustain above the overhead resistance of $0.02815521 on Feb. 4, which is a negative sign.\n\nThe TRX/USD pair has formed a symmetrical triangle and its next move will start after a breakout or breakdown from it. The 20-day EMA has turned flat, and the RSI has dipped to the midpoint, which points to a range bound action in the short-term.\nA break out of the triangle can carry the coin to $0.03575668, and above it to $0.038. However, if the bears break below the triangle, a drop to $0.02113440 is probable. The traders can continue to protect their long positions with the stop loss at $0.023.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) is not showing any signs of buying as it continues to slide through the support levels. Having broken down of $0.07864971, it can now slide to the next support at $0.05795397. Both moving averages are sloping down, which shows weakness. However, the RSI has entered deep oversold territory, which suggests that a pullback is possible.\n\nAny attempt to recover will face a stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA, and above it at the breakdown level of $0.09285498.\nThe XLM/USD pair will show signs of a reversal if the price breaks out and sustains above the downtrend line. Until then, every pullback will be sold into.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) has been one of the strongest performers among the major cryptocurrencies this year. It has secured its place in our analysis after rising to the tenth spot by market capitalization.\n\nAfter a long downtrend, the BNB/USD pair is attempting to change its trend. It broke out of the descending channel on Feb. 2 and has continued to move up since then. It can now reach the level of $10, which had previously acted as a strong resistance.", "birthday": "2019-02-06T23:50:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-06 23:50:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 6}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nWhile some are predicting the end of cryptocurrencies, the co-founder and CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey has projected a very bullish future for Bitcoin (BTC). During a podcast with Joe Rogan, Dorsey said that he sees Bitcoin as the Internet\u2019s native currency, his point of view later supported by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao.\nIn a poll conducted by Finder.com.au, crypto experts predicted that Bitcoin will see a reversal of fortune in 2019 and can rally to $7,000 by the end of the year. The most bullish forecast among the respondents was made by COO of Digital Capital Management, Ben Ritchie who put the number at $9,500 by the end of 2019.\nMike Novogratz, CEO of crypto bank Galaxy Digital tweeted that the crypto prices might take longer to turn around. However, he is confident that the institutional players will take the plunge and carry the market higher.\nWe believe that cryptocurrencies are at a tipping point. A breakdown from the critical support levels will extend the bear market, while a sharp move up could signal a probable bottom.\nBTC/USD\nSmall range trading action continues in Bitcoin (BTC). The bulls could not push the price above the 20-day EMA in the past two days, which shows weakness.\nThe bears will now attempt to push the price to the critical support at $3,236.09. A break of this level will resume the downtrend and negatively affect the sentiment. The next support on the downside is at $3,000, which is a psychological threshold. If this level also cracks, the slide could extend to $2,600.\n\nOn the other hand, if the bulls scale above the 20-day EMA, the BTC/USD pair will rise to the 50-day SMA. We shall turn bullish if we see a range expansion to the upside that sustains for at least a couple of days. Such a move will indicate strong buying and a probable change in trend.\nThe downtrend line has been acting as a stiff resistance since late November of last year. A break out of this line is likely to attract further buying. We might propose long positions on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above the downtrend line.\nThe upside levels to watch out for are $4,255, above which the move could stretch to $4,914.11. Upon crossing that hurdle, the cryptocurrency could rally further to $5,900.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) continues to lose ground. It is likely to drop to the critical support at $0.27795. A break of this level could sink the pair to the yearly low of $0.24508.\n\nConversely, if the bulls defend the support at $0.27795 and push the price above the 50-day SMA, the XRP/USD pair is likely to pick up momentum. We believe that a break out of the 50-day SMA can propel the pair to $0.4, with a minor resistance at $0.38239. The traders can initiate long positions as recommended in our analysis on Jan. 30.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) turned down from close to the overhead resistance on Feb. 3. The 20-day EMA is sloping down, and the RSI is below 50 levels, which shows that the bears have the advantage.\n\nA breakdown of the support at $103.2 will be a negative development that can drag the ETH/USD pair to the next support at $83. If that support also breaks, the downtrend will resume.\nThe pair will gain strength if it breaks out of the tight range of $103.2\u2013$116.3. We expect a move to $134.5, and above it to $167.32. As the risk-reward ratio is high, we suggest long positions on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $116.3. The stop loss for the trade can be kept at $102.\nEOS/USD\nEOS broke out of the 20-day EMA on Feb. 2 but failed to scale the 50-day SMA. Currently, the bulls are again trying to break out of the 20-day EMA and move higher.\n\nA failure to rise above the moving averages will invite selling that can sink the EOS/USD pair to the critical support of $2.1733. A breakdown of this support will result in a drop to $1.7746, and below that to $1.55.\nOn the other hand, if the bulls break out of the moving averages, a rally to $3.05, followed by a move to the top of the range at $3.2081 will be possible. We shall wait for the price to close (UTC time frame) above the 50-day SMA before suggesting a trade.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is facing stiff resistance at $121.3. The 20-day EMA is also located just above this level. Hence, we expect it to act as a major hurdle. If the price turns down from the current levels, it can again drop to $105 and below that to the low at $73.5. The failure of the bulls to scale the 20-day EMA shows that the sellers still have the upper hand.\n\nThe BCH/USD pair will show strength if it sustains above the 20-day EMA. On crossing this resistance, a rally to $141 is probable. With the 50-day SMA close to this level, we expect another roadblock at $141. After this level is scaled, the pair is likely to pick up momentum. We might suggest long positions if the price closes (UTC time frame) above $141.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) broke above the overhead resistance of $33 on Feb. 2. However, the bulls could not build upon the breakout and carry the price to the next overhead resistance at $36.428.\nA small positive is that the bulls have managed to sustain above the breakout level of $33 since scaling it. If the price rebounds sharply from $33, we anticipate a move to $36.428, and above it to $40.784. The traders can retain their stop loss at $27.5.\n\nConversely, if the bears sink the LTC/USD pair below $33 and then below the moving averages, it will be a bearish sign. Support on the downside is at the small uptrend line, and below it in the support zone of $27.701\u2013$29.349. A breakdown of this zone will be a negative development that can plunge the pair to the yearly low of $23.090.\nTRX/USD\nTron (TRX) fell below the 20-day EMA repeatedly from Jan. 31 to Feb. 4, but the bears could not capitalize on the falls. The lower levels attracted buying, which pushed the price back above the moving average.\n\nCurrently, the bulls are attempting to break out of the overhead resistance at $0.02815521 once again. If successful, the TRX/USD pair can move up to $0.03575668, with a minor resistance at $0.03128011. We, however, shall book complete profits closer to $0.04.\nIf the bulls fail to break out and sustain above the overhead resistance, the bears will again attempt to sink the pair below the 20-day EMA. The important levels to watch on the downside are $0.02306493, and below it $0.02113440. We recommend traders hold their long positions with the stop at $0.023.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) continues to trade near the yearly lows without any signs of a sharp bounce. Both moving averages are trending down and the RSI is in the oversold zone, which shows a lack of buying support even at these levels.\nThe target level to watch on the downside is $0.07864971, and if this support gives way, the drop could stretch to $0.05795397.\n\nNevertheless, if the XLM/USD pair turns around from the current levels and rises above the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA, it can reach $0.13427050. A break out of this resistance could carry the pair to $0.184, which will act as a major hurdle. We shall wait for the price to scale above the 50-day SMA before turning positive.\nBSV/USD\nBitcoin SV has been clinging on to the support at $65.031 for the past seven days. A breakdown of this level can result in a drop to $57, and below that to $38.528.\n", "birthday": "2019-02-04T22:50:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-04 22:50:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 4}

However, the email address is not valid, some users wrote.\nCotten\u2019s wife and executor of estate, Jennifer Robertson, did not attend the hearing at the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, where Quadirga\u2019s CCAA application was reviewed, because of security concerns, according to Jack Julian, a CBC journalist who was present there.\nCourt documents cited by The Globe and Mail show that Cotten filed a will on Nov. 27, just 12 days before his death, leaving Robertson all his assets, which included properties in Nova Scotia and in British Columbia, a 2017 Lexus, an airplane, a yacht and two of his pet chihuahuas, along with $100,000 for their care. An alleged copy of Cotten\u2019s death certificate, issued by the Indian government, recently surfaced online. The document still raised some concerns among Reddit users, who noted that Cotten\u2019s surname was misspelled.\nCotten's laptop will now be given to lawyers representing the creditors. Eventually, it will be passed over to Ernst & Young, the court-appointed monitor. Julian from CBC wrote on his Twitter that the device was previously held by QuadrigaCX representatives.\nCanada's largest crypto exchange with a complex history\nQuadrigaCX was launched in December 2013 and operated from Vancouver, British Columbia. The digital assets exchange was founded by Gerald Cotten and Michael Patryn. Prior to that, Cotten was a director at the Vancouver Bitcoin Co-op, a voluntary association of local cryptocurrency enthusiasts, of which Patryn was also an active member.\nAccording to Cotten, QuadrigaCX was established against the backdrop of scarce crypto services in Canada. In February 2015, he said on a Decentral Talk Live podcast:\n\u201cIt was just so hard to buy Bitcoin in Canada. You couldn\u2019t hook up your bank account anywhere. It was just such a challenge.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, QuadrigaCX became the country\u2019s largest crypto exchange, with around $37.4 million traded on their platform \u2014 according to the company, it had acquired around 60 percent of the market share by November that year.\nQuadrigaCX is also reportedly the first crypto platform in Canada to be granted a money services business (MSB) license from the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (FinTRAC), the domestic financial regulator responsible for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures. As Cotten told Straight in a February 2014 interview, his exchange was focused on compliance:\n\u201cWe\u2019re quite proactive when it comes to regulations. We don\u2019t want to break the law. We want to fully comply, and we actually more than comply with what the current laws are.\u201d\nDespite claiming to be a compliant company, QuadrigaCX doesn\u2019t have a public office. In February 2018, Reddit user u/Psychofig claimed that, after he checked out the address stated on the exchange's website \u2014 223-2055 Commercial Drive, Vancouver BC \u2014 he discovered it was nonexistent. In response, the company said that they had an office before, but closed it down for the public due to security concerns:\n\u201cIts a PO [post office] box, just like our competitors. We could have a physical office where you could visit, but then we would risk being robbed like Canada Bitcoins.\u201d\nIn March 2015, Quadriga Fintech \u2014 the exchange\u2019s parent company \u2014 announced its plans to go public and be listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) via a reverse initial public offering (IPO). The firm reportedly planned to acquire a shell company called Whiteside Capital Corporation for that purpose. \u00a0\nDespite going through the easier route of a reverse IPO \u2014 which includes less paperwork \u2014 Quadriga Fintech still had to be audited. Cotten claimed at the time that he was \u201cexcited to be able to provide an unparalleled level of transparency by merging legacy financial audits with innovative blockchain technology.\u201d \u00a0\nThere has been no update on the IPO plans from Quadriga since then, and the firm was never listed on the CSE. In May 2015, however, Patryn revealed that his company was selling over-the-counter (OTC) shares for Bitcoin (BTC).\nIn March 2016, the British Columbia Securities Commision (BCSC) barred QuadrigaCX from selling securities after slapping it with a cease trade order (CTO) for not submitting annual audited financial statements for the fiscal year that ended Oct. 31, 2015.\nAbout a week before getting hit with the CTO, Quadriga\u2019s directors Anthony Milewski and Lovie Horner resigned. Then, soon after the order was issued, Bill Filtness, the director, and Natasha Tsai, the chief financial officer, also quit the company, leaving Patryn and Cotten as the only executives in Quadriga.\nHowever, In March 2018, Quadriga\u2019s official Reddit account commented that Patryn was \u201can early [sic] who left the company more than two years ago.\u201d Although that checks out with his LinkedIn account showing that he left the firm in February 2016, Patryn\u2019s resignation from Quadriga was never announced. Reddit users have several times linked Patryn to a convicted money launderer named Omar Dhanani. Quadriga has denied this accusation, calling it \u201cnonsense\u201d.\nCotten highlighted security as one of the main priorities of his business. According to a CNBC article published in May 2014, QuadrigaCX held the majority of its assets in cold wallets \u2014 which are secured by digital security keys in order to protect them from hacking and theft \u2014 had advanced encryption, custom operating systems and software, and a partnership with CloudFlare, a large company in the United States that provides DDoS protection.\nNonetheless, Quadriga CX had experienced at least one major security breach in the past. In June 2017, the exchange announced that it had lost 67,317.25 ETH (around $14 million, at the time) due to a \u201ctechnical glitch.\u201d\nLegal fight with the CIBC and Cotten\u2019s sudden death\nIn 2018, the exchange entered a prolonged legal fight with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC). The bank reportedly froze five accounts belonging to Quadriga\u2019s payment processor, Costodian Inc., and its owner, Jose Reyes. Combined, they contained around $19.6 million, according to reports. The CIBC suspended the accounts after failing to identify the owner of those funds.\nThe CIBC requested the Ontario Superior Court to withhold the funds and determine whether they belong to Costodian, the exchange or the users who deposited the funds. Further, in November 2018, the court ruled in favor of the bank, agreeing that the owner of the funds was not clearly established. As a result, the CIBC was obliged to pass the funds over to the Accountant of the Superior Court in order to identify the owner of the money. Meanwhile, Quadriga users continued to actively report withdrawal issues, while massive complaints started to arise earlier in 2018.\nOn Jan. 14, 2019, Cotten\u2019s wife, Jennifer Robertson, announced that her husband, CEO at Quadriga, has suddenly died. According to Robertson\u2019s statement, Cotten, who was 30 at the time, perished \u201cdue to complications with Crohn's disease\u201d on Dec. 9, 2018 while travelling in India. Being Cotten\u2019s estate executor, she also recommended to appoint Aaron Matthews, head of operations at Quadriga, as interim president and CEO.\n\nGerry Cotten. Image source: Facebook\nThe platform continued to accept funds for weeks after Cotten\u2019s death. According to The Globe and Mail, on Jan. 25, Robertson, who says she was not involved in the business while her husband was alive, filed an application to hold an emergency meeting to appoint board directors at the exchange. On Jan. 28, the board allegedly decided to shut down QuadrigaCX\u2019s website. The official announcement claimed that the platform went offline due to maintenance issues. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nSeveral days later, on Jan. 31, QuadrigaCX filed for creditor protection in compliance with the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) at the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The CCAA is a federal act that allows financially challenged companies to avoid bankruptcy by restructuring their business and getting protection from its creditors. A company must owe to creditors in excess of $5 million to be eligible to apply for the CCAA.\nAccording to the affidavit filed by Robertson, Cotten was solely responsible for the wallets and corresponding keys to 190 million Canadian dollars ($145 million) in digital assets. Accordingly, after he died, those funds went missing, and the exchange has been unable to retrieve those keys.\nAs a result, the exchange claims to have only CA$375,000 ($286,000) in cash, while it owes CA$260 million ($198,435,000) to as many as 115,000 of its customers, and hence is facing a liquidity crisis.\nWill the money ever be reclaimed? Some claim that there was no money in the first place\nAccording to the affidavit, Cotten normally ran the business from his personal laptop. While Robertson still has physical access to the device, she claims that she is unable to open it. She wrote in the document:\n\u201cThe laptop computer from which Gerry carried out the companies\u2019 business is encrypted and I do not know the password or recovery key. Despite repeated and diligent searches, I have not been able to find them written down anywhere.\u201d\nRobertson also says that she hired someone to try to access the funds, but that the expert has so far not been able to do so.\nMeanwhile, Robertson faces a backlash from the QuadrigaCX users on social media, who mostly took to Twitter and Reddit to question whether Cotten is actually dead. As per The Globe and Mail, the CCAA filings include a statement of death issued by J.A. Snow Funeral House in Halifax.\nMoreover, Robertson\u2019s affidavit states that there have also been threats made against her: \u201cSlanderous comments have been made against me and sent through Facebook messenger to my entire contact list.\u201d Robertson is reportedly funding the creditor protection motion herself, and a preliminary hearing has been set for Feb. 5.\nQuadriga aims to appoint Big Four audit company Ernst & Young as an independent third party to monitor their CCAA hearings, and the court is expected to release its decision on Feb. 5 as well. So far, Ernst & Young has reportedly concluded that \u201cQuadriga was unable to access the cold wallets and/or discovered that the cold wallets contained minimal cryptocurrency units.\u201d\nTaylor Monahan, former developer of Ethereum (ETH) wallet interface MyEtherWallet (MEW) who now runs the MyCrypto project, told Cointelegraph that she finds the situation where excessive amounts of digital assets are locked out because they were controlled by one person \u201cbeyond absurd\u201d:\n\u201cThe fact that a person controlling millions of customer assets didn\u2019t have any sort of backup in place, gave no one else access, and didn\u2019t leave any information regarding these accounts with anyone is beyond absurd. If this is indeed the truth, any number of outside factors could have resulted in the loss of access to those customer funds, like fire, flood, misplacing the single piece of paper, etc.\u201d\nIdeally, Monahan adds, the cold storage wallet should be a multi-signature one, where the keys that control the individual accounts are kept secure and in multiple physically separate locations:", "birthday": "2019-02-05T16:56:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-05 16:56:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 5}

The international organization highlighted blockchain \u2014 alongside remote gaming sectors and the government\u2019s citizenship-by-investment scheme \u2014 as being high on their list of concerns regarding possible Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance violations.\nIndeed, blockchain has remained one of top priorities for the Maltese government since July 2018, when it approved three blockchain- and crypto-related bills, aiming to establish a strong and transparent crypto regulatory climate: namely, the Digital Innovation Authority Act, the Innovative Technological Arrangement and Services Act, and the Virtual Financial Asset (VFA) Act.\nAnnouncing the changes via Twitter, Silvio Schembri, the junior minister for financial services, digital economy and innovation within the Office of the Prime Minister of Malta, claimed that the country became \u201cthe first world jurisdiction to provide legal certainty to this space.\u201d\nThe 3 Bills that will regulate DLT have been approved by Parliament and enacted into law. Malta , the first world jurisdiction to provide legal certainty to this space. #blockchainisland @JosephMuscat_JM\u2014 Silvio Schembri (@SilvioSchembri) July 4, 2018\n\nIndeed, throughout 2018, a significant number of foreign crypto players who faced regulatory difficulties back home \u2014 including cryptocurrency exchanges OKex, Binance and BitBay \u2014 set up their operations in Malta due to the development of a friendlier crypto space. Additionally, Malta has the lowest corporate tax percent for international companies in the European Union \u2014 set at just 5 percent, comparing to the average of 22 percent \u2014 which appears to be an attractive factor for such relocation as well. Given that such legislation is scarcely present in other countries, where crypto is either not regulated or prohibited altogether, Malta indeed might seem like a logical destination.\n\nChief risk officer at OKex Tim Byun told Cointelegraph:\n\u201cWhat we really love about Malta is it provides a balanced and robust regulatory framework.\u201d\nIn September 2018, the prime minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, highlighted the country\u2019s crypto-friendly status globally while addressing the United Nations during a summit in New York.\n\u201cWe are currently in exciting technological times. This is why in Malta, we have launched as the blockchain island by being the first jurisdiction worldwide to regulate this new technology that previously existed in a legal vacuum.\u201d\nFurther, in October 2018, Malta signed a declaration to promote blockchain usage along with seven other EU countries. As Julie Myers Wood, CEO at global investigations and security company Guidepost Solutions, told Cointelegraph:\n\u201cRather than waiting for global guidance or just applying its existing rules to the crypto business, Malta moved forward aggressively to create a new regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.\u201d\nOn Nov. 1, the VFA Act entered into force. No licensed agents have been announced so far, as the process is still ongoing.\nSetting up a crypto company in Malta might be more difficult that it seems \u2014 and the framework is in place\nDespite Malta\u2019s reputation as being a pro-blockchain country with fast-tracked bureaucracy, the process of setting up a crypto-related business on the island seems to be considerably complex.\nOn Oct. 18, the Times of Malta reported that almost two-thirds of those applying for Malta\u2019s cryptocurrency agent certification have failed. Since the VFA Act came into force in July 2018, the exam as well as a training course have been mandatory for all those looking to work as \u201cagents\u201d in the crypto sector of Malta. The bill elaborates that \u201cagents\u201d are practitioners such as lawyers, accountants and auditors who may want to liaise between initial coin offering (ICO) operators \u2014 or other cryptocurrency vendors \u2014 and the island\u2019s watchdog, the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA).\nAccording to the Times of Malta, around 250 people took the exam, which contained a series of multiple choice questions. After recognizing the percentage of successful candidates was set to be \u201cextremely low,\u201d the examiners allegedly made a last-minute decision to revise the assessment scheme. Nonetheless, the pass rate eventually transpired to be 39 percent.\nJonathan Galea, president of BitMalta, a local nonprofit organization dedicated to the advocacy of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, who wrote his doctorate of law thesis titled \u201cThe Effect of Bitcoin on Money Laundering Law\u201d in the past, told Cointelegraph that the domestic AML framework for crypto companies consists of several layers.\nOn top of AML and Know Your Customer (KYC) policies imposed by the domestic crypto regulatory framework, there is the Fifth AML Directive that was introduced across the EU in July 2018 as a response to the terrorist attacks and the offshore leaks investigated in the Panama Papers. According to Galea, crypto exchanges and wallet service providers specifically are subject to the Directive in Malta, as well as other crypto \u201cagents\u201d defined by the above mentioned VFA Act.\n\u201cAll operators, agents, and services providers hoping to conduct business in Malta will need to stringently adhere to obligations under the AML framework in Malta, which has always been implemented a notch above what is normally required on an European level. We recognise certain risks related to such a new industry as this one [crypto], which are mostly associated with exchanges and ICOs, and therefore we are doing everything we can to address them from the get-go.\u201d\nDaniele Bernardi, CEO at financial advisory company Diaman Group, which has a physical presence in Malta, confirmed to Cointelegraph that the MFSA has split their regulatory purview into two sectors after enacting the blockchain-related bills: Now, the watchdog oversees blockchain and traditional businesses separately \u2014 however, strict KYC and AML procedures are mandatory for both sectors, Bernardi adds. According to his view, money laundering with cryptocurrencies is even less realistic in Malta:\n\u201cThe real problem in Malta is that all the banks in Malta don\u2019t open any kind of account for crypto companies, due to their fear of breaking the AML policy. So if you have a lot of Bitcoin, but you are not able to convert it into fiat, you are not able to complete money laundering.\u201d\nMalta\u2019s questionable past with traditional financial sector hinders local crypto adoption\nWhile the Maltese government arguably managed to bring more transparency into the local crypto space, its previous record with the traditional financial sector doesn\u2019t help, Wood told Cointelegraph:\n\u201cHistorically, Malta has been challenged with respect to financial crime enforcement even in traditional sectors, and it is currently working on a detailed plan to improve and enhance its financial security framework more generally, including strengthening its financial intelligence unit and improving the supervisory framework. As such, Malta\u2019s embrace of a new area is of some concern to global oversight bodies, including the IMF.\u201d\nIndeed, as Bloomberg writes, EU officials have largely deemed Malta\u2019s Individual Investor Programme \u2014 a government initiative that sells Maltese passports to foreigners for 650,000 euro (~$750,000), though less for additional family members \u2014 controversial, arguing that it could lead to an influx of dirty money into Europe\u2019s financial markets.\nThere are more concrete problems on the island, many of which were investigated by journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who studied the Panama Papers and claimed that two of Muscat\u2019s close associates had established companies in the country. According to Caruana Galizia, they used the firms to launder money and illegally sell passports to Russian nationals. Later, she reported that Muscat\u2019s wife had also registered her own Panamanian shell company, which allegedly engaged in suspicious activities as well. Eventually, Caruana Galizia\u2019s blog became the most-read news source in Malta, as per Bloomberg, and she faced as many as 47 lawsuits, about 70 percent of which were purportedly filed by government representatives. In October 2017, Caruana Galizia was killed by a car bomb.\nIndeed, Malta\u2019s effective implementation of controls and enforcement may be of some question, as Mike Carter, senior director at professional services firm Alvarez & Marsal\u2019s Disputes and Investigations, told Cointelegraph, citing several concrete examples:\n\u201cOnly 92 money laundering investigations were conducted from 2013 through 2017. In July 2018, the European Banking Authority criticized Maltese application and enforcement of money laundering laws, citing \u2018general and systematic shortcomings.\u2019 In 2018, the European Central Bank withdrew the banking license for Pilatus Bank, operating in Malta since 2014, and launched investigations into the Maltese Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit\u2019s handling of money laundering activity.\u201d\nHaving crypto businesses added into the mix wouldn\u2019t necessarily help the local government, Carter adds, although Maltese officials allegedly recognize the AML-related problems:\n\u201cMalta\u2019s government published its own money laundering and terrorist financing assessment, noting the country as high risk of receiving foreign proceeds of criminal activity. This risk is especially notable with regard to cryptocurrency, as Maltese exchanges with poor customer and transaction monitoring controls would further highlight that susceptibility.\u201d\nTherefore, while the Maltese government has embraced the reputation of being the \u201cblockchain island\u201d and ceased the opportunity to evolve a definite regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, which the EU has notably been struggling with, its history with the traditional financial market continues to put international officials on guard.\n\nMeanwhile, the local opposition is also alarmed. On Jan. 26, the Nationalist Party (PN) doubted the efficiency of the government\u2019s crypto-oriented politics. The PN highlighted the recent closure of blockchain company DQR Group, which relocated to Malta from Germany in April 2018 in a bid to find a friendlier environment for their business. Specifically, Silvio Schembri argued that the firm\u2019s arrival would \u201ccement Malta\u2019s reputation as the Blockchain Island\u201d as the firm\u2019s arrival was announced.\nAccording to local media outlet Lovin Malta, DQR had laid off most of its staff after one of its main investors, the German Bitcoin mining company Genesis Mining, ran into financial difficulties caused by the bear market.\nReacting to the news, PN representatives argued that the government had no sustainable strategy to \u201cbuild and strengthen\u201d the blockchain industry in the country. The party said in a statement, quoted by Malta Today:\n\u201cIf the government really wants Malta to become the Blockchain Island, it should attract sound and credible investment from renowned companies and companies able to provide all the necessary expertise for Maltese workers to grow and prosper in this innovative sector. [...] The government should ensure that [...] proper due diligence is carried out before granting licenses to operators.\u201d", "birthday": "2019-02-02T16:54:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-02 16:54:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 2}

", "content": "On Jan. 29, the valuation of the crypto market plunged by more than $10 billion within a 48-hour period, from $121 billion to $111 billion.\nMajor cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) recorded losses in the range of 5 to 10 percent against the United States dollar, demonstrating poor momentum.\nThroughout the past several months, the cryptocurrency market has demonstrated volatility in a low price range, unable to break out of key resistance levels.\nWhat were the major factors of this week\u2019s drop?\nWhile some analysts have said that the drop was triggered by technical factors over fundamental, speaking to Cointelegraph, former hedge fund manager and investor Danny Les stated that the crypto market has been in a bear market for over a year and conditions will not change until the market establishes a proper bottom.\n\u201cTechnical or fundamental, it makes no difference. I\u2019ve been saying this for over a year now, we are bearish and will continue to be bearish until the market finds a point where buyers are waiting en masse.\u201d\nIn mid-December, the price of Bitcoin achieved a new yearly low at $3,122, and at the time, analysts including Three Arrows Capital CEO Su Zhu said that big buy walls in the low $3,000 region will prevent the dominant cryptocurrency from plunging to $2,000.\n10% down from here (3.3k), buy walls on @coinbase are now the largest (in $BTC notional ) since mid-2015. Similar for @Bitstamp. pic.twitter.com/NmMpZXazgX\u2014 Su Zhu (@zhusu) December 12, 2018\n\nAs Bitcoin neared $3,100, the buy walls on fiat-to-crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Bitstamp led the asset to initiate an immediate bounce and it eventually recovered to mid-$3,000.\nSimilarly, as Bitcoin approached $3,300 on Jan. 29, the asset recovered to the $3,400 to $3,500 range with relative strength.\n\nBitcoin is still en route to $2,000\nThe crypto market is set to experience the longest correction in its 10-year history, and based on the intensity of the sell-off of major crypto assets in the past several months, the bear market will likely extend across the first two quarters of 2019.\nIn November 2018, Willy Woo, the creator of Woobull.com, said that the correction is likely to last until the end of second quarter of this year or longer.\n\u201cPutting together the blockchain view, I suspect the timing for a bottom may be around Q2 2019. After that we start the true accumulation band, only after that, do we start a long grind upwards.\u201d\nIn an interview with Cointelegraph, Les suggested if Bitcoin drops to $2,000, it would mean a 90 percent drop from its all-time high at $20,000, surpassing the average drop from the all-time high at around 85 percent in previous major corrections:\n\u201cOn the contrary, I actually think the closer we get to $2k, the more buyers lie in wait. I legitimately believe what my good friend David Belle thinks, the floor will be around the $1.5k-$2k area and at that point a lot of money will be waiting to enter the arena.\u201d\nDid Bitcoin futures make any difference?\nLast week, CME Bitcoin futures contracts in the U.S. market expired. The futures market has often been used as a short-term price indicator of Bitcoin, as it was said that the expiration of futures could incentivize investors to attempt to manipulate the market.\nIn the early days, the San Francisco Federal Reserve reported that the launch of CME Bitcoin futures led to the decline in the price of cryptocurrencies.\n\"The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence. It is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the introduction of futures markets for an asset.\"\nHowever, futures contracts in the U.S., at least for now, are all cash-settled and as such, the supply of Bitcoin futures contracts is fixed, which restricts the effect it could have on the value of BTC. Bakkt, which is set to launch later this quarter, will become the first physically settled Bitcoin futures market in the U.S.\nJake Chervinsky, a government enforcement defence and securities litigation attorney at Kobre & Kim, explained that physically settled contracts like Bakkt could have an actual impact on the price of the asset in the future.\n\u201cNoteworthy is the fact that Bakkt will custody and deliver real bitcoin. That means institutional inflows would reduce supply and thus (maybe) increase price too. This is different from other regulated futures markets like CME and CBOE, which only deal in cash-settled futures.\u201d\nLes similarly stated that the Bitcoin futures expiration in the U.S. likely had a minimal effect on Bitcoin. Historically, Les said that the CME Bitcoin market, which was highly anticipated by investors in the cryptocurrency sector, did not sway the price of the asset in a major way.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think futures closing made a difference. Just like when the CME Bitcoin markets kicked off and everyone expected it would have a huge effect on price. It didn\u2019t. Same applies here as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\nBecause the futures market is of significant size for traditional assets like gold, many investors attempt to correlate the expiration of futures and the performance of Bitcoin.\nIn the long run, if Bakkt sees a rapid increase in volume and, as a result, other large futures market operators \u2014 such as ErisX, CME, CBOE and potentially even the Nasdaq \u2014 experience exponential growth, the correlation between futures and the Bitcoin price on exchanges could increase. But, it is currently not big enough to move the price of BTC.\nWhen the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected nine Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that were based on the futures market in August 2018, the commission the also stated that the Bitcoin futures market is not big enough to handle ETFs. The commission said:\n\u201c[The ETFs] have not met the requirement that a national securities exchange\u2019s rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices. Among other things, the Exchange has offered no record evidence to demonstrate that bitcoin futures markets are \u2018markets of significant size.'\u201d\nIn the short term, at least, the crypto exchange market will likely have a larger impact on the price trend of crypto assets over both over-the-counter (OTC) and futures markets.\nWhat lies ahead for the crypto market in 2019?\nThere are catalysts on the horizon that could potentially allow the cryptocurrency market to recover.\nAs Cointelegraph reported, Fidelity Investments is said to be planning on March to be the launch date of its Bitcoin custody, which could lead some of its 13,000 institutional investors to invest in cryptocurrencies.\nFidelity said in a statement obtained by Bloomberg that it is already engaging in discussions with some of its clients.\n\u201cWe are currently serving a select set of eligible clients as we continue to build our initial solutions. [...] Over the next several months, we will thoughtfully engage with and prioritize prospective clients based on needs, jurisdiction and other factors.\u201d\nBakkt and the Nasdaq are also set to release Bitcoin-related investment vehicles and products by the end of the quarter.\nBut, because the cryptocurrency market moves by cycles and the market has demonstrated a free fall without much resistance, a slow, gradual downside movement to a region where big buy orders are filled remains the most probable result. Les stated:\n\u201cBearish and with a slow, gradual slide down to the area I mentioned [is] where I think liquidity lies in wait. Sure, retail will move the price up and down in fairly obvious ranges but the really significant action will begin around the \u2018Belle Zone\u2019 as I like to call it.\u201d\nPotential impact of major Bitcoin investment vehicle launches in 2019\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Les said that if Fidelity Bitcoin custody launches in March, it will likely not have an immediate impact on price, and the same could be said for Bakkt and Nasdaq. Rather, it will allow investors to be more confident in the cryptocurrency sector and the asset class, which may lead investors to establish orders in a low enough range.\nVinny Lingham, a general partner at Multicoin Capital, said this week that the crypto winter could easily turn into a nuclear winter if Bitcoin drops below key support levels.\nIf we break below $3000 for Bitcoin, \u201ccrypto winter\u201d will become \u201ccrypto nuclear winter\u201d... https://t.co/sS83cl6Em1\u2014 Vinny Lingham (@VinnyLingham) January 28, 2019\n\nIf the product launches of Fidelity, Nasdaq and Bakkt come in a period wherein the general sentiment around cryptocurrencies has not recovered yet, it may have a minimal impact on the price trend of cryptocurrencies, according to Les:", "birthday": "2019-02-03T12:01:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-03 12:01:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 3}

The two entities, which the report dubbed Alpha and Beta, are most likely still active. While the two groups differ in their timing of cashing out, both organizations reportedly transfer the stolen funds an average of 5,000 times to prevent exchanges from flagging the hacked cryptocurrency with their anti-money laundering (AML) systems.\nIran Plans Release of Digital Currency With Aim to Avoid US Sanctions\nIran is soon planning to unveil its state-backed cryptocurrency, local sources reported this week. The so-dubbed crypto-rial would potentially serve as a way for the country to sidestep sanctions, the most debilitating of which is the lack of access of most Iranian banks to the SWIFT payment system. Iran is also currently reportedly in talks with eight countries to discuss the possibility of using cryptocurrency for financial transactions, but the local sources were unclear if it concerns crypto in general or a state-backed coin. Also this week, Iran released a draft of its crypto regulation plans, noting that some aspects of crypto would be banned.\n\n\nWinners and Losers\nThe crypto markets remain steady at the end of the week, with Bitcoin trading at around $3,471, Ripple at $0.31 and Ethereum at about $108. The total market cap is at around $114 billion.\nThe top three altcoin gainers of the week are Obitan Chain, Bitdepositary and Mindexcoin. The top three altcoin losers of the week are empowr coin, Mothership and PayPie.\n\nFor more info on crypto prices, make sure to read Cointelegraph\u2019s\u00a0market analysis.\nMost Memorable Quotations\n\u201cInterestingly, we just polled 4,000 Bitcoin investors and their number one investment for 2019 is actually gold.

Crypto analyst and trader Moon Overlord tweeted that the digital currency had bottomed out approximately 200 days prior to its halving in 2015, and the ensuing rally peaked roughly two years after the event.\nIf history repeats itself, the virtual currency might have bottomed out by now and could maintain an uptrend for the next two years. Though a nice observation, we believe that the current situation is significantly different from 2015, so a repeat of previously seen events is unlikely. \u00a0\nBen Askren, a popular Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) martial artist, tweeted a video in favor of cryptocurrencies and Litecoin, which should help give it cryptocurrency greater visibility.\n\nAfter breaking down of the support at $47.246 in mid-November of last year, the LTC/USD pair found support at $23.090. The bulls have been attempting to push the price higher, but faced selling close to the $40 mark.\nIf the overhead resistance zone of $40\u2013$47.246 is scaled, we anticipate the start of a new uptrend. The longer the pair remains inside a range, the stronger will be the eventual breakout. The targets to watch on the upside are $65.561, and above it $69.279.\nHowever, if the digital currency turns down from either of the overhead resistances and plunges below $23.090, the downtrend will resume. We expect the current range bound action to continue for a few more days before a decisive move up or down begins. \u00a0\nBNB/USD\nCrypto exchange Binance has entered into a partnership with payment processing company Simplex to offer its customers the ability to buy cryptocurrencies with credit cards. The company has completed the sale of BitTorrent (BTT) tokens in under 15 minutes, which shows strong underlying demand.\nCan Binance Coin break into the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nOur suggested buy on a close (UTC time frame) above the descending channel has not triggered. As the 20-week EMA is just above the channel, we recommend traders to wait for a close above the 20-week EMA before entering long positions.\nA breakout and close above the descending channel confirms a change in trend. After the breakout, the BNB/USD pair can either start a new uptrend or enter into a consolidation. In the case of an uptrend, it can rally to $12, and above it to $15. However, if a consolidation ensues, we expect it to hold above $5.4666.\nConversely, if the bears sink the price back into the channel, it will indicate weakness and a retest of the low at $4.1723848 will be probable. Hence, we propose a stop loss at $5 after long positions are initiated.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) saw some wild movements this week due to various news and rumors. SWIFT, a major global banking payments network, announced plans to launch a proof-of-concept gateway in partnership with blockchain software firm R3.\nThis got the rumor mill churning, with some speculating that it might eventually lead to some kind of a tie-up between Ripple and SWIFT. This resulted in a sharp spike in the XRP price, which did not sustain for long.\nJapanese finance giant SBI Holdings has also acknowledged Ripple\u2019s potential in international remittance. Is it time to buy the cryptocurrency? Let\u2019s analyze the chart.\n\nThe XRP/USD pair has been trading inside the descending channel since late September last year. The bulls are trying to defend the support at $0.27795. Both moving averages are sloping down, and the RSI is in the negative zone, which shows that the bears have the upper hand.\nIf the price turns down and breaks below $0.27795, it can drop to the yearly low of $0.24508. A break below the yearly low will resume the downtrend.\nHowever, if the bulls push the price above $0.45097, we expect a double bottom formation that will have a pattern target of $0.62399. Above this level, a move to $0.7644 is probable.\nBTC/USD\nThe current bear market in Bitcoin (BTC) has become the longest in its short trading history, overtaking the 2013-2015 bear phase. One event that can alter the course of the bear market is the approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nJust days after withdrawing its Bitcoin ETF application, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), along with investment firm VanEck and financial services company SolidX, has resubmitted the application to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\n\nThe BTC/USD pair has been trading in small intraweek ranges for the past three weeks. This shows a balance between the buyers and the sellers. After this period of low volatility, we anticipate the activity to increase within the next few weeks.", "birthday": "2019-02-03T19:11:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-03 19:11:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 3}

Not only are some savvy players installing\u00a0ad blockers to stop banners appearing, but the inconvenience can even cause some customers to abandon a title altogether.\nAndreas Schemm, a gaming expert and Vreo\u2019s CEO, said: \u201cIn-game advertising is a huge and growing market for targeted advertising. Regular players are usually spending a large chunk of their free time gaming, but dislike distracting and irrelevant ads.

Instead, content creators would receive recurring profits from players as they interact with the advertising that has been built into the surroundings of the game.\nReady for launch\nVreo is preparing to enter the market in early 2019 after completing a round of public funding.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/swift-announces-poc-gateway-with-r3-but-remains-overall-hesitant-about-blockchain", "title": " SWIFT Announces PoC Gateway With R3, but Remains Overall Hesitant About Blockchain ", "content": "On Jan. 30, major global banking payments network SWIFT announced it plans to launch a proof-of-concept (PoC) of a gateway \u2014 titled GPI Link \u2014 that will allow blockchain software firm R3 to connect to SWIFT\u2019s Global Payments Innovation (GPI) payments from its platform.\nTherefore, SWIFT has made another step toward adopting blockchain, despite having expressed concerns over the technology's maturity in the past. However, SWIFT\u2019s competitors have already voiced their concerns, saying that the new system is not decentralized enough.\nBrief introduction to SWIFT\u2019s relationship with blockchain\nSWIFT is a 46-year-old Belgium-based interbank messaging service and a co-operative owned by about 11,000 member banks in more than 200 countries. Its network handles as much as $5 trillion worth of transactions per day worldwide, according to the United States Department of Treasury data, which includes more than half of all high-value cross-border payments, as per the Financial Times, making SWIFT one of the most significant players in the banking industry.\nSWIFT\u2019s relationship with blockchain \u2014 the technology that seems to have the potential to improve cross-border payments \u2014 has been somewhat rocky. After all, the international banking network had asserted its dominance in the financial field long before the blockchain arrived: In the 1970\u2019s, SWIFT replaced the low-speed Telex system with a unified system of codes to name banks and describe transactions, transferring financial messages with greater speed and security.\nFirst, in December 2015, Wim Raymaekers, head of banking and treasury markets at SWIFT, announced that the banking network may integrate fintech innovations \u2014 including blockchain \u2014 to implement faster and transparent cross-border payments.\nFurther, in April 2016, SWIFT and global consulting services company Accenture released a joint report that looked at the use of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) in financial services. Specifically, the paper acknowledged some strengths of the blockchain \u2014 like efficient information propagation, traceability, simplified reconciliation, trusted system and high resiliency.\nHowever, the report also noted that the technology was not mature enough to be used on an industrial scale. Namely, SWIFT and Accenture argued, the technology lacked regulatory compliance, standardization, identity framework, cyber defence and scalability.\nNevertheless, a year later, in April 2017, SWIFT announced that it was going to use the Hyperledger Fabric v 1.0. \u2014 a permissioned blockchain framework hosted by the Linux Foundation \u2014 to update its practices of cross-border market payments.\nThus, the proof-of-concept (PoC) tested whether DLT can make cross-border payments more efficient, transparent and quick. It became part of SWIFT\u2019s larger program to increase transparency and traceability of its cross-border payments through its GPI service, which was launched earlier in February 2017. Significantly, GPI promises \u201cfaster, same day use of funds\u201d \u2014 which is a longtime needed update to the conventional banking system, where typical international payments take three to five working days to complete. Nevertheless, the GPI itself is technically a messaging system, and despite supporting real-time, end-to-end tracking, it is not blockchain-based.\nPoC implies testing feasibility of a project before it is fully realized \u2014 which is why SWIFT limited the experiment to its DLT sandbox, instead of rolling out an untested product to the main network, upon which thousands of banks around the world rely on a daily basis.\nFirst, SWIFT\u2019s PoC members included 12 financial institutions \u2014 such as Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon and others \u2014 who had their own nodes deployed within the network\u2019s DLT sandbox. Later, in July 2017, SWIFT\u2019s test project added an additional 22 banks, including Commerzbank, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and JPMorgan Chase Bank.\nIn March, SWIFT revealed that it had finished the PoC test of blockchain. The banking network was left somewhat disappointed with the technology, stating that blockchain is not ready for mainstream use as \u201cfurther progress is needed before it will be ready to support production-grade applications in large-scale, mission-critical global infrastructures,\u201d although the tests themselves went \u201cextremely well.\u201d\nAs Damien Vanderveken, head of research and development at SWIFT, explained to the Financial Times at the time, a substantial amount of banks would have to drastically modernize their systems before they could turn to a blockchain-based system for their cross-border payments, although the DLT itself proved to be efficient.\nReportedly, the testing involved the creation of 528 sub-ledgers for 28 participating banks to avoid confidential information being revealed to rivals. Thus, Vanderveken argued, all of the SWIFT members \u2014 thousands of banks \u2014 would require 100,000 sub-ledgers to be established, which is technically burdensome because of maintenance issues.\nNevertheless, Vanderveken reported positive results as well, saying that DLT helped the reconciliation of Nostro accounts for lenders (essentially, a Nostro account is a bank\u2019s account in a foreign currency in another bank).\n\u201cAlthough the proof of concept demonstrated DLT could improve Nostro liquidity management and reconciliation processes, it also revealed that the prerequisites will have to be met before banks can enjoy the full benefits of switching to a DLT process.\u201d\nSWIFT partners up with R3 to launch GPI Link, plans to expand further\nOn Jan. 30 2019, SWIFT announced another PoC, this time to trial how its GPI program could be applied to e-commerce and trading platforms. Titled GPI Link, the gateway will reportedly allow enterprise blockchain software firm R3 to link to GPI payments from their platform, as per the press release shared with Cointelegraph.\nThe release was originally announced earlier on the same day by SWIFT CEO Gottfried Leibbrandt at the Paris Fintech Forum:\n\u201cOur new GPI platform is extremely interoperable and open, and we\u2019ve always had links to other networks. [...] We are announcing later today a proof-of-concept with the R3 blockchain on trade where you can initiate a payment on the trade platform and then it goes into GPI. So we\u2019re exploring interconnectivity with a lot of things.\u201d\nTherefore, those using the R3 platform will now be able to authorize payments through GPI Link, settling the GPI payments with the users\u2019 banks and having the credit confirmation reported back to the trade platforms via the GPI Link when they are completed. The PoC will reportedly support application programming interfaces (APIs), as well as SWIFT and ISO standards.\nThe PoC will eventually expand to support other DLT platforms, as well as non-DLT and e-commerce trading platforms. Still, R3 should be able to provide a jumpstart for SWIFT\u2019s expansion into the DLT field: Having just recently launched its Corda Network earlier this year, R3 has gathered over 300 partners from across multiple industries to collaborate on developing Corda, its open-source, Ethereum-based blockchain platform, as well as its business-oriented offshoot Corda Enterprise.\nIn the press release announcing GPI Link, Luc Meurant, SWIFT\u2019s chief marketing officer suggested that there is more demand for DLT-powered settlement for fiat money rather than cryptocurrencies:\n\u201cWhile DLT-enabled trade is taking off, there is still little appetite for settlement in crypto-currencies and a pressing need for fast and safe settlement in fiat currencies. [...] Given the adoption of the Corda platform by trade ecosystems, it was a natural choice to run this proof of concept with R3.\u201d\nAccording to the press release, the results of the freshly announced PoC will be presented in London in September 2019.\nRipple vs. SWIFT \u2014 who is least centralized?\nLeibbrandt announced the PoC while sitting beside Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple (XRP), in a joint panel. Ripple has branded itself as a blockchain competitor to SWIFT\u2019s global interbank network \u2014 Garlinghouse had just recently commented in November 2018 that \u201cwhat we are doing on a day-to-day basis is in fact taking over SWIFT.\u201d\nRipple\u2019s CEO told Bloomberg at the Singapore Fintech Festival 2018:\n\u201cSWIFT said not that long ago they didn\u2019t see blockchain as a solution to correspondent banking. We\u2019ve got well over 100 of their customers saying they disagree.\u201d\nWith the arrival of SWIFT\u2019s GPI Link, Ripple might be forced to achieve greater results with xRapid and xCurrent, its blockchain-powered tools for easing cross-border fiat transfers between financial institutions.\nSpecifically, Ripple\u2019s xRapid platform has reportedly proven to save transaction costs by 40-70 percent by not having to use foreign exchange providers and has increased transaction speed to \u201cjust over two minutes\u201d during its pilot run, when the company tested payments between the U.S. and Mexico in May 2018.\nSince then, players as big as Spain-based Santander Bank, Malaysian lending giant CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, and Japanese bank holding and financial services company MUFG have joined Ripple\u2019s cross-border payments network RippleNet. Nevertheless, despite being a Ripple investor, in October 2018, Santander joined the SWIFT GPI program.\nGarlinghouse has countered SWIFT CEO\u2019s recent announcement and criticized the banking network for being centralized:\n\u201cDecentralized systems I think over time are likely to win. I think that today that is not what Swift is. Swift today is a one-way messaging framework, it isn\u2019t a liquidity provider. [...] When we think about an internet of value, it\u2019s a mixture of two-way messaging frameworks \u2014 moving to a real-time chatting protocol if you will \u2014 coupled with real-time liquidity.\u201d", "birthday": "2019-02-03T18:33:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-03 18:33:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 3}

Its research suggests that 2018 saw far more sophisticated, higher-earning scams carried out using ETH, although the actual number of these crimes dropped significantly year on year.\nThe amount stolen through ETH-based scams doubled from $17 million in 2017 to $36 million in 2018. This equates to 0.01 percent of ETH in circulation.\nChainalysis identified over 2,000 scam Ethereum addresses, which have managed to secure funds from nearly 40,000 unique users in the network. In the space of two years, the modus operandi of scammers seems to have changed, according to data collected by Chainalysis.\nPhishing, Ponzi schemes and initial coin offering (ICO) exits are still the most prevalent, but there has been a shifting trend.\nPhishing scams were all the rage in 2017, which led to a surge in this type of crime. Users cottoned on to the ever-increasing number of these attacks, which led to a decrease in the efficacy of phishing scams.\nAs a result, the average amount sent to a scam address was nearly half of the amount in 2017. 2018 then saw the rise of elaborate Ponzi schemes and ICO exit scams, which yielded millions of dollars in income.\nThe reason for Ethereum\u2019s perceived popularity with scam artists is its utility as a platform in which people can start and launch their own native cryptocurrency tokens through ICOs.\nIt is fairly easy for any project to put together a convincing website and business proposal, and raise funds in a decentralized way through the Ethereum blockchain. As the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies surged in 2017, investors easily parted ways with their crypto holdings, in the hopes of seeing massive returns on their investments.\nNefarious individuals and groups took advantage of the situation, which has inevitably fleeced many an unsuspecting investor.\nThe three ETH scams of choice\nFirstly, it must be noted that Ethereum, as a platform, does not inherently provide the right environment or tools for scam artists to carrying out various schemes. The simple fact is that Ethereum is the platform of choice for entrepreneurs looking to launch decentralized, blockchain-based projects. As per data provided by Chainalysis, 82 percent of all ICOs are created on the Ethereum blockchain.\nAs the leading platform to raise crypto funds, scam artists went about hunting for unsuspecting victims using three main methods.\nPhishing is considered to be the most popular type of ETH scams over the past few years. The modus operandi is fairly simple, scammers send potential victims emails or other communications that tricks them into sharing private financial information that gives attackers access to their ETH wallets.\nPonzi schemes have become more prevalent. These schemes promise investors abnormally high returns on an initial investment. Initial returns are paid out by new investment funds coming in, but eventually the scammers make off with most of the funds, leaving victims empty-handed.\nICO exits have also become more popular as of late. Criminals set up fake companies or projects with elaborate marketing material and websites. Funds are raised through ICOs but once that is complete, the criminals sell off the proceeds and disappear with all the capital, once again leaving investors with nothing.\nAs Chainalysis explains, phishing scams were the most-popular scamming method in 2017, but users became more wary the following year and the prevalence of these scams reduced. Furthermore, as criminals began to change up their methods of attack, the median amount of money stolen from individuals seemed to drop.\nIn 2018, the average amount sent to a scam was $94, nearly $50 less than 2017\u2019s median. The median total revenue made in 2017 was more than $6,500, but that dropped drastically to less than $2,500 last year.\n\nIn 2017, 49 scam operations made less than $100, while that number increased to 181 in 2018. Sixty-five of these scams made less than $10, indicating that investors are becoming far more savvy at picking out fraudulent operations.\nPonzi schemes, ICO exits most lucrative\nWhile the overall success of scams seems to be dwindling, a small number of these activities have managed to steal millions of dollars from unsuspecting investors.", "birthday": "2019-02-04T12:55:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-04 12:55:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 4}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nCEO of CoinList Andy Bromberg expects 2019 to be a quiet year for cryptocurrencies in terms of price while crypto firms focus on developing products and services that are useful to the public. A few analysts, however, expect the leading digital currency to fall further. With the January\u2019s negative closing, Bitcoin has now fallen for a record six months in a row.\nThis has not influenced the top firms to shelve their crypto related projects. Investment firm Fidelity has said that its cryptocurrency trading and custody platform is in the final stages of testing. Currently, these services are being offered to a small group of clients who are helping the firm test and refine the process. Once complete, the services will be offered to the other institutions and large clients.\nHopes for a Bitcoin ETF are back on track as the Chicago Board Options Exchange, along with investment firm VanEck and financial services company SolidX, has re-submitted its application to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\nDue to the ongoing bear market, many crypto companies are struggling to make ends meet. This has presented an opportunity to the hedge funds that are well capitalized. They have turned venture capitalists and are making the most of this fall, reports Bloomberg. Following these new developments, let\u2019s see if we find any buying opportunities.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) has been inching higher for the past three days. It is close to the 20-day EMA, which will act as a resistance. The bulls have not been able to rise above the 20-day EMA after falling below it on Jan. 10. The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is also below 50, which suggests that the bears have an upper hand.\nIf the price turns down from the moving averages and plummets below $3,236.09, it will trigger a large number of stop losses. The next support on the downside is at $3,000 and below that $2,600.\n\nIf the bulls push the price above both the moving averages and the downtrend line, it will signal a probable change in trend. The first sign of bullishness will be after the BTC/USD pair breaks out and sustains above $4,255. We might suggest traders to buy in small quantities on a close above the 50-day SMA. Until then, we remain neutral on the leading cryptocurrency.\nXRP/USD\nWe had anticipated a stiff resistance between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. Ripple (XRP) turned down from just under the 50-day SMA on Jan. 31.\n\nOn the downside, the bulls bought the dip to support from the downtrend line. This is a bullish sign. However, the XRP/USD pair needs to scale above the 50-day SMA to signal strength. We retain our buy recommendation given in the previous analysis.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the bears plummet the cryptocurrency below the critical support of $0.27795.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) has been trading inside a tight range of $103.20 and $116.30 for the past four days. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the negative zone suggest an advantage to the bears. The horizontal resistance and the 20-day EMA, both are close to $116.30; hence, we expect this level to act as a major roadblock.\n\nHowever, if the bulls scale $116.30, the digital currency can move up to $134.50. Above this level, the up move can reach $167.32. As the upside potential is high, we might propose long positions if the price sustains above the 20-day EMA.\nOn the other hand, if the ETH/USD pair breaks down of $103.20, it can correct to the lows at $83.\nEOS/USD\nEOS re-entered the range on Jan. 30. Currently, the bulls are attempting to defend the bottom of the range. If successful, the cryptocurrency is likely to break out of the moving averages and rally towards the top of the range at $3.2081. Though there is a minor resistance at $3.05, we expect it to be scaled. We might suggest long positions on a close (UTC time frame) above the 50-day SMA.\n\nContrary to our assumption, if the EOS/USD pair breaks below the range and the critical support at $2.1733, the downtrend will resume. The important support levels to watch on the downside are $1.7746 and below that $1.55.\nBCH/USD\nFor the past two days, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been struggling to scale above the overhead resistance of $121.30. If successful, it can move up to $141. We shall wait for the price to sustain above $141 before turning positive.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is below 50, which suggests supply exceeds demand. If the BCH/USD pair reverses direction from the current level and plunges below $105, it can dip to $73.5.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) has been consolidating in a tight range of $29.349 to $33 since Jan 11. After bouncing off the bottom of the range, we anticipate an attempt to break out of the overhead resistance once again.\n\nIf successful, the LTC/USD pair can rise to $36.428 and above this level to $40.784. Hence, we suggest traders protect their long positions with the stop at $27.5. Nonetheless, if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the support zone of $29.349 and $27.701, it can plunge to $23.090.\nTRX/USD\nThe rebound from the 20-day EMA was short-lived as Tron (TRX) could not sustain above the overhead resistance at $0.02815521 on Jan. 27.\n\nThis attracted selling and dragged the TRX/USD pair back below the 20-day EMA. Currently, the pair is attempting to rise above the 20-day EMA once again. If successful, the bulls will again try to break out of the range.\nConversely, if the bears sink the digital currency below $0.02306493, it can drop to $0.02113440 and below that to $0.0183. Hence, we suggest traders keep the stop loss at $0.023.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) pulled back to the breakdown level of $0.09285498 on Jan. 30 but failed to climb above it. This has pushed the price down to new lows once again. The downtrending moving averages and the RSI in the oversold zone show that the path of least resistance is to the downside.\n\nIf the XLM/USD pair does not reverse direction quickly and rise above the overhead resistance at $0.09285498, it can plummet to $0.07864971. If this support also breaks, the downtrend can extend to $0.05795397.\nOn the contrary, if the virtual currency rises and sustains above $0.09285498, the bulls will attempt to breakout of the downtrend line. We might suggest long positions above 50-day SMA. Until then, we suggest traders remain on the sidelines.\nBSV/USD\nThe attempt to bounce off the critical support at $65.031 fizzled out after just one day. The price is currently back at the support.\n", "birthday": "2019-02-01T20:20:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-01 20:20:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 1}

OKC Holdings bought 3,182,790,001 shares at a price of HK$0.1520 ($0.019) each, for 60.49 percent of the company and voting rights.\nThe transaction is only one in a string of cryptocurrency exchanges and other crypto-related companies that have followed this backdoor strategy to getting listed on a traditional stock exchanges.\nOn Aug. 21, 2018, cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global bought a controlling share in Pantronics Holdings Ltd., an electronics manufacturing company.\nPantronics Holdings is also listed on the HKEX, with a market cap of just over HK$1 billion (~128 million). Huobi bought a controlling share of 71.67 percent, consisting of 215,576,000 at HK$2.72 ($0.35) per share.\nAt the time, Sandy Peng, a partner at Fission Capital, a blockchain services provider platform that participated in the transaction, stated that it was a \u201cstraight-forward acquisition\u201d in an apparent attempt to detract from the fact that it was a reverse merger.\n\u201cFission [has] years of experience in the HK Capital market. We participated in this acquisition alongside Huobi [and] believe [in] Huobi\u2019s rich experience in this sector. The institutional and regulated international platform this new vehicle creates will be the ideal launchpad for any international and institution-related businesses that Huobi may decide to explore in the future.\u201d\nOn Jan. 22, Blockchain Industries, a publicly traded company in the United States, announced they had signed a letter of intent with Singapore-based holding company BTHMB (renamed Blockchain Exchange Alliance).\nBlockchain Exchange Alliance bought a controlling share in BitHumb Holdings, which owns the Seoul-based exchange BitHumb. Although CoinMarketCap lists the exchange as number 214 by trade volume, a November 2018 report by CryptoCompare listed it at as number one by average 24-hour volume.\nAnd in August 2018, former Goldman Sachs trader Michael Novogratz managed to get his crypto-focused merchant bank, Galaxy Digital, listed on Canada\u2019s TSX Venture Exchange, also through an apparent reverse merger. He achieved this by buying a crypto startup, Coin Capital, merged it with a listed Canadian shell company called Bradmer Pharmaceuticals, and renamed the company Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd.\nReverse IPO explained\nThe goal of a private company entering into a reverse merger is to get listed on an exchange \u2014 i.e., to go public \u2014 without going through the complexities and regulatory intricacies of an official IPO. In order to do that, the private company buys a controlling share in a listed company. Once the transaction is complete, the private company has effectively become a publicly traded company.\nThe public company will often be nothing more than a shell corporation with very little \u2014 if any \u2014 trading activity. This makes it easy for the private company to impart their trading activities into the corporation without much effort or resistance.\n\nThe benefits of a reverse IPO for crypto companies\nGetting listed through a reverse merger is much cheaper and a lot quicker than the traditional IPO path. A reverse IPO can be completed in as little 30 days, while it is not uncommon for a normal IPO to take up to one calendar year, or even longer. Private companies that want to go public go through intense regulatory scrutiny as they look to raise capital from their public share sale. There are no public share sales in a reverse merger, so the process is much simpler from a regulatory standpoint.\nFor crypto companies specifically, a reverse IPO gives them access to additional avenues of funding. Although they don\u2019t get any funding directly from the merger, once they go public, they are exposed to the capital markets that make their shares instantly more liquid.\nThis is a good strategy in the current crypto bear market, which has seen funds raised from initial coin offerings (ICOs) drop sharply during the second half of 2018.\n\nThe company is not looking to raise instant capital, so the process is less dependent on current market conditions. However, the increased liquidity brings more options for long-term funding through secondary offerings, mergers and acquisitions, and increased share prices that comes with trading at higher multiples.\nA public listing could also attract more institutional investors. They crave more transparency, and a reverse IPO would raise the crypto company\u2019s profile in their eyes by becoming public. Some institutional investors might also be interested in the crypto market but don\u2019t necessarily want to open a different trading account to get access to it. A listed crypto company would, therefore, make it easier for them to invest through the channels that they are already used to.\nFinally, a reverse merger can help a crypto company gain access to a different market by acquiring a controlling share in a shell company that is located in a different country. Again, this is beneficial if the organization is established in a country where regulators are pushing back on IPO applications from crypto companies, as is the case in Hong Kong.\nThree of the world\u2019s biggest manufacturers of cryptocurrency mining rigs \u2014 Bitmain Technologies, Canaan Creative and Ebang International Holdings \u2014 have all logged IPO applications to get listed on the HKEX. None of them have yet been approved, with HKEX\u2019s chief executive, Charles Li Xiaojia, citing volatility, the absence of regulation and inconsistency in business offerings as the main reasons:", "birthday": "2019-02-01T13:52:00+00:00", "date": "2019-02-01 13:52:00", "year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 1}

Its ecosystem includes three separate but interchangeable blockchain payment methods, together with its own crypto bank, cloud mining platform and multi-currency exchange.\nSecure and private\nThe first blockchain payment method is PyrexCoin (PYX), operated by a decentralized peer-to-peer (p2p) exchange network with no management or major issuer to rule it. The company assures that this cryptocurrency is untraceable, secure, anonymous and borderless. A p2p network makes all the users' transactions on the PyrexCoin blockchain unlinkable to a particular user or real-world identity.\nThe anonymity of all operations is provided by CryptoNote technology, which protects the payments from being tracked. The special privacy feature implemented on the platform \u2014 called Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) \u2014 also makes the PyrexCoin resistant to blockchain analysis. \u201cPrivacy is mandatory for all operations, in order for it to be effective,\u201d the company says. Built-in privacy features make the PyrexCoin fungible and all coins have equal value.\nAll transactions can be done via the user-friendly and intuitive wallets: PyrexCoin GUI wallet, which is provided in 34 languages, and a mobile wallet named PyrexGate, one of \u201cthe most secured\" mobile wallets due to a special password encryption mechanism and biometric access. It supports a QR-code generator and scanner, NFC, and hardware cold wallets, such as Trezor and Ledger NANO.\nPyrex also emphasizes that PyrexCoin is an open-source project, so every user can make an impact on the new cryptocurrency\u2019s development process.\nThe second payment method can be used for the services available within the PyrexPlatform. Golden Pyrex (GPYX) is an ERC-20 utility token for paying for such services as PyrexBank fees, Marketplace products, PyrexExchange fees and Cloud Mining contracts at a discount rate. The company has issued 10 million GPYX, and it intends to sell 77,7 percent during its token sale. The startup plans to spend the capital raised by the token sale on the development of the PyrexBank, obtaining necessary licenses and permits, and for covering listing fees on major exchanges.\nCyberbank as a funding mechanism\nPyrexBank, the \u201cnext generation private digital bank\u201d developed on scalable Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) technology, offers traditional banking services and technological tools for managing crypto funds. Within PyrexBank, the users of the platform can give or receive loans together with their deposits\u2019 interest, based on credit scoring smart contracts. The banking accounts can be denominated both in crypto and fiat currency.\nThe team says, the use of digital currencies makes operations faster and cheaper, while traditional currencies guarantee practically all-round acceptance and validity. One account combination allows clients to simultaneously use advantages of both types of currencies.\nThe company emphasizes that all transactions are secure and have little to no fees. The clients of PyrexBank can also use its services, which include trading and liquidity management for fiat currency and crypto assets, together with a \u201chighly secure storage\u201d system for those assets. Moreover, PyrexBank enables a full range of crypto corporate finance services (e.g., advice for fundraising through a security token offering, for token design and for risk management).", "birthday": "2019-01-30T18:54:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-30 18:54:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 30}

The company raised $97 million during its fundraising phase, a princely sum for a platform that has garnered millions of users since its inception.\nFollowing the SEC\u2019s recommendation of an enforcement action in November 2018, Kik was served with a \u201cWells Notice,\u201d a letter to the company that needs to be responded to in 30 days.\nKik replied to the SEC in their \u201cWells Response\u201d letter in December, arguing that the SEC\u2019s regulation by enforcement approach has negatively affected the development of blockchain and cryptocurrency in the U.S. and has subsequently led to businesses in the sector either shutting down their projects or moving overseas.\nBefore we delve into the intricacies of this situation, it is worth understanding what it is that Kik does, how its native token was created and works, and why it believes the SEC\u2019s potential ruling is wrong.\nKik Messenger \u2014 privacy-focused messaging\nKik Interactive has been in existence since 2009, following its creation by a group of students at the University of Waterloo. The group was looking to solve a barrier in communication between Blackberry, Android and iPhone users.\nSince its initial release in 2010, the Kik Messaging application has garnered a reputation for its privacy features, including its user sign-up process that doesn\u2019t require a telephone number.\nThe platform identifies itself as the only chat platform built for teenagers \u2014 which has also led to plenty of controversy around the use of the app by minors, and the platform\u2019s use by perpetrators of child exploitation.\nNevertheless, the app is extremely popular, with an estimated 300 million users worldwide, according to data from 2016.\nKik\u2019s anonymity and privacy features are extensive, and the company claims that it cannot locate user accounts based on their names, email addresses or birth dates. The exact username used to create an account is required to locate a particular account.\nFurthermore, the company does not have access to user content and data like photographs, videos and text of conversations. Photos and videos are automatically deleted shortly after they are sent.\nAccording to the Kik website, the platform has raised over $120 million from Foundation Capital, RRE Ventures, Spark Capital, SV Angel, WeChat creators Tencent, Union Square Ventures and Valiant Capital Partners.\nHowever, its 2017 TDE, which is essentially an initial coin offering (ICO), has brought the company into the spotlight, facing potential action from the SEC.\nThe Kin TDE\nTwo years ago, in September 2017, Kik created its very own native cryptocurrency known as Kin using the Ethereum blockchain. Kin was launched as an ERC-20 token for the initial sale and distribution of tokens.\nAccording to initial reports, Kik raised 168,732 ETH \u2014 worth around $47 million at the time \u2014 from over 10,000 different users. Institutional investors were able to partake in a presale event, which accounted for a further $50 million, taking the total amount raised to just under $100 million.\nThe token was intended to be used for in-app transactions, in exchange for goods and services.\nKin\u2019s argument against the SEC\nAccording to Kik CEO and founder Ted Livingstone, Kin meets the standards of a currency, which directly contradicts the findings of the SEC.\nIn a blog post on Medium on Jan. 27, Livingstone summed up his feelings and shared the company\u2019s Wells Response:\n\u201cOn page 11 of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act, the very act that created the SEC, it explicitly states that the definition of a security \u2018shall not include currency.\u2019 Today you can earn and spend Kin in over 30 apps live in the Google Play and iOS App Stores. Already, hundreds of thousands of people have exchanged Kin for goods and services. Kin is one cryptocurrency that truly is a currency.\u201d\nKik\u2019s response to the SEC is a comprehensive document outlining a plethora of reasons why it is opposing any regulatory action against its TDE and the Kin cryptocurrency.\nIn short, the company argues that Kin was designed, marketed and offered as a currency to be used as a medium of exchange. Considering this, Kik argues that the token falls outside of the definition of a security:\n\u201cSimply put, Kik did not offer or promote Kin as a passive investment opportunity. Doing so would have doomed the project, which could only succeed if Kin purchasers used Kin as a medium of exchange (rather than simply holding it as a passive investment). Accordingly, Kik marketed Kin, not as an investment opportunity, but rather as a way to participate in a fundamentally new way for consumers to access digital products and services, and for innovative developers, and their users, to be compensated for the value they provide.\u201d\nGiven the focus on maintaining user privacy and trust, Kik recognized that it could not directly compete with larger social media platforms and messaging applications that monetize their business by selling advertising and user data based on an attention-based economy.\nTo this end, it created a virtual currency in 2014 called Kik Points within the Kik Messenger. The experiment was a success, and for two and a half years, users earned and spent Kik Points on content in the app.\nKik Points were awarded to users for filling out surveys and polls within the messaging app. This was monetized by Kik, which sold Kik Points to advertisers who then paid consumers for answering these polls and surveys.\nAccording to the company, Kik Points generated an average of 300,000 transaction per day, and at its peak, Kik claims its monthly transaction volume was nearly three times that of Bitcoin.\nThe project eventually came to an end, but the success of the Kik Points system provided the basis for the concept of the Kin cryptocurrency.\nThe company maintains that since its inception, Kin was promoted as a currency for daily digital transactions, but ultimately as the basis for a new digital economy. Kik also claims that it intended to be a participant in the ecosystem, to ensure a decentralized environment.\nThe company capped its presale at $50 million to give individual users a fair chance to participate in the token sale. Individual users could only buy approximately $4,400 worth of Kin. Kik noted that more than 50 percent of buyers bought less than $1,000 of tokens, adding further argument against the sale of Kin as a security.\nKik also required buys to pass KYC/AML and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) regulations in its treatment of Kin as a currency.\nKPMG audited the sale, and determined that the funds raised should be treated as revenue in line with sales of inventory. Kik also paid taxes on the sale\u2019s proceeds in accordance with the Canada Revenue Agency\u2019s view that the proceeds were income.\nIn light of all of this, the company is pleading to the SEC\u2019s commissioners to not take action against it, considering the lengths Kik went to in order to ensure that its token sale met all regulatory requirements:\n\u201cIf the Commission disagrees with Kik and the Foundation with respect to the central legal issue, it should nonetheless use its discretion and decline to bring an enforcement action. The Company took substantial measures to comply with the law. Further, any action will not only harm Kin purchasers, who the Commission purports to protect, but it will carry the ill effects of regulating through enforcement.\u201d\nWatershed case of the crypto community\nThe crypto community will now wait for the SEC to consider Kik\u2019s Wells Response before deciding if it should carry out creating a recommendation to the SEC commissioners to authorize a case against the company.\nThe next step is for the SEC staff to take these two documents and decide if they want to make a recommendation to the four SEC commissioners to authorize a case against the company.\nIn his daily newsletter, crypto industry investor Anthony Pompliano expressed his belief that Kik\u2019s response sends a strong message for the crypto community as a whole to stand its ground when it comes to harsh regulatory measures:", "birthday": "2019-01-31T15:42:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-31 15:42:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 31}

The incoming governor, Mark Gordon, made room for some blockchain talk in his\u00a0inauguration speech, celebrating the state\u2019s innovative approach to regulation and touting a handful of homegrown startups. Over the next couple of weeks, Wyoming\u2019s legislature\u00a0erupted with a series of groundbreaking crypto-related bills that is only comparable to a similar\u00a0wave in March of last year.\n\nAmerica\u2019s least populous state, whose economy has been always skewed toward mining and agriculture, looks determined as ever to deliver on the promise to\u00a0become the nation\u2019s \u201ccrypto valley.\u201d Consonant with this jaunty tune, blockchain startups have indeed started pouring into the area. Perhaps Wyoming\u2019s biggest signing this year so far is\u00a0the relocation of Iohk, the company behind the Cardano blockchain.\nThe\u00a0sweeping changes that the Cowboy State\u2019s lawmakers have recently passed or introduced as bills include defining three categories of digital assets and treating them as property; granting assets designated as virtual currencies the same legal status as money; authorizing banks to hold digital assets in custody;\u00a0allowing corporations to issue certificate tokens that represent shares; and creating a regulatory fintech sandbox aimed at further diminishing any regulatory hurdles to industry startups. These developments look more radical than many of the other states\u2019 recent blockchain-savvy moves, as they often explicitly challenge a variety of disparate federal approaches to crypto regulation.\nCelebrating the news of another revolutionary piece of crypto legislation from Wyoming, one could wonder: Is this for real? Are they serious about this? What is it they are really shooting for? Putting Wyoming\u2019s newfound crypto drive in a broader context could shed some light on how and why the state of ranchers and miners decided to boldly reach out to the crypto industry.\nCourting the giants\nIt is not unprecedented for a small state far removed from traditional technology and financial hubs to be courting a burgeoning new industry amid regulatory uncertainty \u2014 something that often happens after the initial period of explosive growth. Once a state is willing to tweak its laws to provide a greenhouse level of care and protection to a particular class of enterprises, moving from the comfort of coastal urban areas into some windy plains doesn\u2019t seem like that much trouble any more.\nAn unlikely\u00a0romance between Citibank and South Dakota provides a textbook example. In the early 1980s, when the initial gold rush of early credit card lending business began stalling under the weight of regulations \u2014 such as strict interest rate caps \u2014 policymakers in the Midwestern state saw their chance. Taking advantage of a Supreme Court ruling that allowed banks to charge the highest interest rate allowed in their home state, South Dakota introduced a batch of lax banking laws and invited banks to feel themselves at home. In 1981, Citibank was the first to respond to the call, bringing thousands of new jobs into the area. The city of Sioux Falls now has about 20,000 financial sector jobs, while South Dakota holds more bank assets than any other state.\nAnother place in the United States that definitely knows how to attract out-of-state enterprises is Delaware. Its hospitality extends beyond just tech businesses, or any specific kinds of businesses, for that matter \u2014 the state has long been known as a\u00a0tax haven and is now\u00a0home to almost a half of all U.S. public corporations. More recently, it has seen a surge in limited liability corporations (LLC) registration, thanks to relative ease of incorporation and a small flat LLC tax. Delaware also has a far-reaching statewide\u00a0blockchain initiative, which apparently became the inspiration for one of the fresh Wyoming bills. Against the background of the already highly welcoming corporate climate, however, Delaware\u2019s set of blockchain-friendly policies inevitably looks less salient than the Cowboy State\u2019s legislative onslaught.\nUnderlying interests\nSo, how exactly does the influx of digital-money businesses promise to benefit Wyoming? Perhaps the simplest hunch is that the state is looking to capitalize on registration and incorporation fees. Delaware\u2019s example is enticing: Once you have a steady stream of newcomers from all over the place, you can enter a virtuous circle by keeping the fees low and attracting even more enterprises. State Rep. Tyler Lindholm, who has been behind most of Wyoming\u2019s key blockchain legislation, openly\u00a0admitted to looking at the Northeastern state as a benchmark, and noted that his state was making about $30 million in fees, against Delaware\u2019s $1.2 billion.", "birthday": "2019-01-30T17:30:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-30 17:30:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 30}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nCrypto investors lost about $1.7 billion worth of cryptocurrencies to hackers in 2018. Though prices are down, it has not deterred the criminals. The volume of stolen coins in 2018 was 3.6 times larger than in 2017, according to the report from research company CipherTrace.\nHacks are a major problem in crypto that needs to be solved before the asset class can be seen positively by the regulators and adopted by the mainstream economy.\nHowever, the entry of investment firm Fidelity into the cryptocurrency custody space instills confidence. According to sources cited by Bloomberg, its custody services are likely to be offered starting in March. Initially, the services will be open only to select institutional clients, but the firm plans to expand operations to a larger audience in the future.\nThe Middle East seems to be warming up to cryptocurrencies. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have officially announced the joint development of an interbank digital currency called \u201cAber.\u201d At first, it will be used only by a limited number of banks.\nWhile the fundamental factors continue to improve, the crypto prices are not showing any signs of a recovery. Let\u2019s look at the critical levels to watch out for.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) is trying to turn around from $3,355. The bulls are attempting to defend the support at $3,236.09. They will encounter resistance at the 20-day EMA and above that at the 50-day SMA. Upon crossing the moving averages, the next resistance will be at the downtrend line, and above it at $4,255.\n\nConversely, if the price turns down from either one of the overhead resistances, the BTC/USD pair will again drop to the support at $3,236.09. A break of this level will resume the downtrend and trigger a number of stop losses on the long positions that can result in a quick drop to $3,000, and below that to $2,600.\nAt present, both moving averages are sloping down, and the RSI is in the negative zone. This suggests that the bears have the upper hand. Therefore, we shall wait for the price to sustain above the downtrend line before turning positive.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) has bounced sharply from the critical support of $0.27795, which shows buying at lower levels. It has broken out of the downtrend line and is currently at the 20-day EMA.\n\nIf the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USD pair can rally to the 50-day SMA. The zone between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA might act as a stiff resistance. A breakout above this resistance zone will be a positive sign.\nTherefore, we suggest long positions on a close (UTC time frame) above the 50-day SMA with the stop below $0.275. The first target objective is $0.38239, above which the upward move can stretch to $0.4.\nOur bullish view will be negated if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and plunges below $0.27795.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) bounced back from $103, close to its first support at $100. It will now pull back to $116.3, where it might face resistance.\n\nIf the ETH/USD pair turns down from $116.3, it can again fall to $100, and below that to $83. The 20-day EMA is trending down and the RSI in the negative territory which suggests that supply exceeds demand.\nIf the bulls scale above $116.3, the digital currency will again face selling close to the moving averages. It will turn positive if the price rises above $134.5. We might suggest long positions if the price sustains above the moving averages.\nEOS/USD\nEOS has held the support at $2.1733 for the past two days. The bulls are currently attempting to push the price back into the overhead range.\n\nIf they succeed, the EOS/USD pair will move up to $2.5, where it might face resistance from the moving averages. A break out of $2.6 will increase the chances of a rally to $3.05 and above that to $3.2081.\nConversely, if the price reverses direction from the current level and plummets below $2.1733, it can correct to $1.7746, and below that to $1.55. We shall wait for the digital currency to scale above the moving averages before suggesting a trade.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) is finding some buying close to $105. It can now move up to $121.3, which will act as a roadblock.\n\nThe downsloping 20-day EMA will also attract sellers. If the bulls scale above this resistance, the BCH/USD pair can move up to $141.\nBut if the price turns down from $121, a drop to $100, and below that to $73.5 will be possible. We shall turn positive if we see evidence of strong buying.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) continues to trade in the tight range of $29.349\u2013$33. The bulls have defended the support of the range for the past two days.\n\nWe now expect the bulls to push the price to the top of the range at $33. A break out of this resistance will be a positive move that can carry the LTC/USD pair to $36.428, and above it to $40.784.\nOn the other hand, if the bulls fail to break out of the overhead resistance at $33, the virtual currency will extend its stay in the range. The trend will turn negative on a breakdown of the support zone at $29.349 and $27.701. Therefore, we suggest the traders hold their long positions with the stop loss at $27.5.\nTRX/USD\nWhile other major cryptocurrencies are struggling to hold up, Tron (TRX) is showing strength. It held the support at the 20-day EMA for the past two days and is now attempting to break out of the overhead resistance at $0.02815521 once again.\n\nIf the bulls sustain above $0.02815521, the TRX/USD pair will move up to $0.03128011, and above that to $0.03575668. Above this level, the cryptocurrency will attempt to hit its pattern target of $0.038.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the price fails to sustain above $0.02815521. A break below the 20-day EMA can plunge the digital currency to $0.02306493, below which a slide to $0.02113440 will be probable. We suggest traders continue to hold their long positions with the stops at $0.023.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) has continued to make new yearly lows. Usually, after a breakdown from a critical level, a throwback rally to retest the level is likely to follow. Hence, a move to $0.09285498 cannot be ruled out.\n\nIf the XLM/USD pair breaks out and sustains above $0.09285498, the bulls will attempt to scale above the downtrend line, which can result in a trend change.\nHowever, if the price turns down from the breakdown level of $0.09285498, the cryptocurrency can slump to $0.07864971, and further to $0.05795397. We shall watch for a trend reversal before turning positive on the pair.\nBSV/USD\nThe bulls have been trying to hold the support at $65.031 for the past two days. If successful, Bitcoin SV (BSV) will attempt to rally to $80.352.\n", "birthday": "2019-01-30T18:04:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-30 18:04:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 30}

", "content": "In the history of blockchain to be written in textbooks, 2018 will probably be known as the year of failing at scaling. An outcry for scalable blockchain systems in 2017 led to a number of companies making attempts at solving the problem of scaling and gradually realising that it\u2019s not that simple.\nAs the year has concluded, ModernToken\u2019s Blockchain Science department presents an overview of known approaches to improving scalability.\nThe great race to reliable scalability started with the outburst of startups and funding campaigns trying to bring distributed ledger technology (DLT) into business and to real-world applications. The first wave of projects triumphantly entering the market with a promise to solve specifically this issue have been, as predicted by experts, spectacularly missing their marks.\nThe most notorious examples of this are EOS \u2014 not fast, not a blockchain, not Byzantine fault-tolerant, according to a report by research firm Whiteblock \u2014 and IOTA, which has publicly acknowledged its own centralization and affirmed that it has never had a solid vision of a decentralized protocol.\nA number of projects that weren\u2019t hard pressed by their marketing to ship their products are still at work, and we\u2019re expecting to see their progress \u2014 whether positive or negative \u2014 in the year to come. Meanwhile, it is worth to explore the problem itself and the ways it is being tackled by the industry.\nProblem overview\nIn broad strokes, the challenge for DLT can be illustrated by the so-called scalability trilemma, coined by Vitalik Buterin: of the three fundamental properties of distributed networks \u2014 decentralization, scalability, and security \u2014 it is hard to have any two without compromising the third one, knowingly or not.\nFor distributed databases with shared state, there is also the CAP theorem, which regards availability (always getting a timely response to a query), consistency (always getting the most recent update or an error message) and partition tolerance (does the system lose liveliness if the network gets split). It is seemingly only possible to hold at most two of these properties.\nTo illustrate, if the network splits in half but remains operational, one has to choose between consistency and availability, as the unreachable part of the network may make updates to state that will not propagate to the reachable part. The theorem has varying effects on DLT architectures as well.\nThe trick is breaking up the state (the data that constitutes a ledger, i.e. the list of all current balances, the collection of current states of every smart contract, etc.) into parts while keeping the high security expectations and preserving the homogeneity of interactions. Namely, any entity (user account, smart contract) needs the ability to transact with any other entity, regardless of the relative places they end up after the state space is compartmentalized.\nLines of inquiry\nWith industry experience and theorycrafting accumulated so far, there are several possible approaches to attempt building scalable blockchain systems. Some of them are only vague sketches of ideas, while for others numerous projects and research teams are working on prototype architectures and proof-of-concept implementations.\nEach approach has its own way of splitting the state, and each one entails its own set of constraints and bottlenecks.\nTo keep focus on the concepts, we refrain from mentioning particular companies and projects, so any resemblance to actual products \u2014 living or dead \u2014 or real events, is coincidental.\nSharding with proof-of-stake\nSharding attacks the problem head-on: instead of having every node replicate the entire state, let\u2019s break it into segments (shards) and spread them between groups of nodes. If a transaction only needs to happen within the shard, processing it is very much like within classical blockchain: nodes within the shard have sufficient knowledge to fully validate it. Otherwise, there needs to be some sort of cross-shard communication. This brings three big questions:\nHow to process cross-shard transactions, since most nodes only keep the state within their shard?For a node that only keeps state from its shard, how does it know with certainty that the state from other shards is consistent with protocol rules and is immutable (i.e. how do we prevent or process shard reorganizations, in relation to other shards)?How should the network deal with partitioning?\nOne of the important points when dealing with sharding is to get rid of proof-of-work (PoW). Since we are trying to build a homogenous network that consists of a huge number of parts, the computational resources will need to be spread thin, and performing a 51% attack on a particular shard will therefore be too easy.\nProof-of-stake, on the other hand, can possess several vital properties: random selection of stakers per round (so that coordinating an attack at one place is hard), stake slashing for byzantine behaviour (unlike with PoW, whereby failing at an attack has mostly opportunity costs) and stake locking (so that entering and exiting the staking game also has time costs).\nSharding with proof-of-authority\nThe sharding itself with this approach is most reminiscent of sharding in classic databases, since it more or less boils down to a trusted party \u2014 or a small fixed collegium of trusted parties \u2014 \u00a0to maintain the data.\nFor the DLT maximalists, this is a conceptual resignation, since such a network can never be permissionless, i.e. fully independent of any realistically corruptible or coercible party or group.\nOn the other hand, it may still interest big enterprises and financial institutions, offering a medium for joint operations with cross-validation, provided there are activities that make business sense in the mutually transparent environment. The upside is that the trust requirements between counterparties can be lowered, if not eliminated completely, as long as the rules of interaction can be coded.\nDelegated proof-of-stake\nThis design only has a handful of master nodes that validate transactions, emit new blocks, and promise to hold the full current state. The network users do not stake currency on new blocks (like in proof-of-stake), but instead stake currency on their preferred validators, which gives them voting power.\nThe idea is that the competition for being in a master node list, associated with high income in block rewards and fees, will drive the master nodes to perform well and have the best possible hardware, far beyond that of a personal computer.\nThere are concerns about possible tendencies to centralization. One of them is that since users only receive ROI on their delegate stake if their delegate is in the master node list, it is counter-productive to stake an outsider: until they get in, any voter just pays the opportunity cost of not staking an insider instead.\nAs a result, insiders have greater power, as they only need to worry about potential massive loss of votes, but can probably get away with smaller Byzantine stuff.\nThere are also uncertainties about auditability: huge state held inside a small number of paid validators creates a situation whereby fully auditing from outside the master node list is a big expense \u2014 since the hardware has to be matched \u2014 but provides zero revenue.\nSome practical implementations of this architecture known to date also have opacity of the state, whereby an external observer, even one willing to commit resources, can never know what\u2019s going on inside the master nodes.\nGeneral purpose interoperability\nWhat if there was an inter-blockchain protocol to deliver in a trustless way transactions and state from any blockchain to any other blockchain?\nHad it existed, such solution would allow scaling insofar as the state can be broken into separate chains. It would also mean great flexibility: blockchains can specialize at their particular business or data specifics and still have the ability to interact with other specialized chains. For instance, a content distribution network that uses an already existing medium of exchange network for paid interactions.\nUnfortunately, this is a highly complex task. The elephant in the room is that it should handle forks and chain reorgs so that the logic on arbitrary blockchains relying on external state does not break. For instance, it needs to ensure that it isn\u2019t possible to double spend on Aristotle chain by paying for something with a Plato transaction and then performing a 51% attack on Plato, forking the chain and removing the paid transaction.\nAmong other approaches to scaling, general purpose interoperability is perhaps the one that relies most heavily on game theory and incentive design. Little, if anything, is known a priori of the systems that should be connected, and the consumer of the relayed transactions cannot be expected to validate them for themselves, otherwise there\u2019s no sense in the relay.\nPlasma: hierarchical blockchains with exits into base layer\nThis concept for DLT was first proposed in August 2017. It involves multiple layers of blockchains: the child layer blockchain is anchored to the parent layer blockchain via a special smart contract that allows withdrawal of assets even if the operator of the child layer goes Byzantine.\nEach block from the child layer is anchored in the smart contract, together with a Merkle root of the tree tracking assets. The child layer clients need to monitor the anchor contract in the parent chain and make sure that the operator sends them every block they submit to the parent chain.\nIf something is wrong (i.e. the operator doesn\u2019t send a user the block they just committed, or the block is malformed), every user can start a withdrawal, asking the anchor contract to return their assets in the parent chain, by supplying a proof of ownership. After a waiting period, when the process can be contested with a fraud proof, the withdrawal completes, and the asset is recovered in the parent chain.\nWhile a great concept, Plasma presents a number of its own challenges and problems. FIrst of all, all of its known architectures rely on the user storing full history of their assets on the chain and actively contesting malicious withdrawal attempts within the expected time windows. The window is the balance between how long the assets are stuck in the contract and how regular of a presence is expected from the user.\nSecondly, the scenarios for mass withdrawals, especially from multiple plasmachains into the same parent chain at the same time, are tough to reason about, and no good security model has been presented so far.\nLastly, so far there have been no proposed architectures that would enable arbitrary smart contracts to hold their own assets in the plasma chain. There are only user-held non-fungible asset units (Plasma Cash), fungible asset units in form of payment channels (Plasma Debit), and arbitrary UTXOs (Minimal Viable Plasma).\nHaving contracts with both state and held assets presents a tough theoretical problem, as every proposed scenario for who and how exactly could contest a smart contract state in case of someone\u2019s Byzantine behaviour have been prone to attacks.\nDirect acyclic graphs\nInstead of building a chain of blocks, where each new block is added at one end, why not grow a tree that expands in multiple directions? This way there is no need for one place or group that has to validate adding a block to a particular place, which is a bottleneck.", "birthday": "2019-01-31T15:16:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-31 15:16:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 31}

The technology leverages the recently released Stratis C# Full Node, the company\u2019s innovative software, whose codebase is built on the Microsoft .NET Core architecture. The service is aimed to make blockchain solutions mainstream, as developers can use existing languages in the familiar and well-populated ecosystem .NET\nStratis recently became a member of the Microsoft Partnership Network, with silver competency as an ISV. The platform is written in the C# programming language, as the company reports on its blog. Over 34 percent of all professional developers are already using this language, according to a survey by Stack Overflow in 2018.\n\u201cOur recent deliveries of smart contracts and sidechains are very innovative, I believe we\u2019re the first platform to have Turing-complete smart contracts in C#,\u201d Chris Trew, Stratis CEO and founder, commented to Cointelegraph. According to Trew, this brings a number of benefits \u2014 primarily, the number of C# developers that are available to audit the code is far greater than other smart contract languages.\n\u201cIn addition, we have witnessed the impact of deploying smart contracts on the mainchain with large adoption so we have specifically delivered our smart contract solution on a sidechain to avoid bloating and performance issues,\u201d adds Chris Trew.\nThe Stratis team believes that migrating to a C#-based implementation will not only improve the performance of the underlying blockchain but also ease the work of third-party developers. \u201cFor example, when it comes to downloading the complete Stratis blockchain, the Stratis Full Node can do this significantly faster than a StratisX node, without compromising on security,\u201d the company\u2019s blog says. The developers building on top of Stratis have the full suite of tools available in C#/.NET development at their disposal. For example, it's the first time that any smart contracts can be developed, compiled, debugged and unit tested all in Visual Studio without any external tools, Stratis says.\nJoin the Stratis Discord here\nAnother goal of the platform and the team behind it is educating beginners and developers in its Academy, providing them with course materials, working examples, technical infrastructure and hands-on projects. \u201cAnother key goal of Stratis is to also educate, we have a number of experienced technical writers that are continuously writing low-level documentation while they\u2019re not occupied with consultancy engagements,\u201d Chris Trew emphasised in a quote for Cointelegraph.", "birthday": "2019-01-30T16:38:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-30 16:38:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 30}

The forum \u2014 held in Davos, Switzerland, as per tradition \u2014 lasted from Jan. 22 to 25.\nSimilar to the last year, cryptocurrencies were one of the major talking points in Davos. In general, it seems that the \u201cBlockchain before Bitcoin\u201d attitude prevailed this time, as the overall positive outlook on the technology coincided with a significant portion of crypto-bashing.\nWEF announced Global Council on Blockchain, co-chaired by BitPesa founder\nAs one of the most important takeaways from the forum, the WEF appointed the CEO and founder of BitPesa, Elizabeth Rossiello, to serve as one of two co-chairs of the Global Council on Blockchain. BitPesa is a Kenya-headquartered startup with the focus on blockchain-powered fiat remittances among the United Kingdom, Kenya and several other African and European countries. The firm was allegedly the first blockchain company to be licensed by the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), as per a press release from the company.\nThe newly established Blockchain Council, in turn, is part of the San Francisco-based Fourth Industrial Revolution and Cybersecurity Center created by the WEF in 2017. The forum has notably recognized blockchain\u2019s major role in the Fourth Industrial Revolution as early as 2016, naming it a \u201cWorld Economic Forum Technology Pioneer\u201d alongside the likes of Google and Wikimedia, which have received the award in the past.\nAt the latest WEF Annual Meeting in Davos, Rossiello reportedly worked with industry experts and the council\u2019s thirty members \u2014 including representatives of regulatory agencies, as well as the civil and fintech spheres \u2014 to outline the council\u2019s agenda and main priorities.\nLater, in May 2019, the council will hold its convention in San Francisco, where it will commence its formal advisory role to the WEF. Its mission seems quite ambitious, given Rossiello\u2019s statement that \u201c2019 will be a critical year for the blockchain industry.\u201d\nSheila Warren, head of blockchain at the WEF, said that Rossiello was chosen for the role of the council\u2019s co-chair \u201cnot only for her diverse background in this space, from technical expertise as well as regulatory, but also for her ability to bring together members of this often fragmented ecosystem.\u201d\nAdditionally, Warren gave an interview to ConsenSys at the event, in which she argued that adoption could be neared if blockchain gets picked up by governments:\n\u201cWhether we like it or not, governments are some of the most successful distribution platforms. If we can find a way to use government to actually deploy and use blockchain technology, we\u2019re going to move a long way towards adoption.\u201d\nWarren highlighted that Asian countries like Singapore, Japan, China and India might be the most important players to push blockchain integration in the near future.\nGlobal Blockchain Business Council reported that 40 percent of institutional investors are really bullish about blockchain\nThe trade association titled the Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC) presented some evidence regarding investors\u2019 interest in blockchain at the WEF meeting. As much as 40 percent of institutional investors believe blockchain may be the most important innovation since the internet, according to the association\u2019s survey.\nGBBC reportedly interviewed 71 investors over two last months to gather data for the survey, 40 percent of whom agreed that blockchain could be the \u201cmost transformative\u201d tech since the internet. Additionally, just under a third of the respondents believed businesses would need to find a head of blockchain on their boards within the next five years. Further, 38 percent of the interviewed investors considered that firms would need to present their blockchain-related roadmaps within that time frame.\n\u201cThere is little doubt about the potential impact blockchain can have on most sectors, and key areas of everyday life,\u201d GBBC CEO Sandra Ro commented at the WEF:\n\u201cIncreasingly, the winning organisations of the future will be those that have a clear and comprehensive strategy for blockchain [...].\u201d\nCircle CEO Jeremy Allaire stood up for crypto\nJeremy Allaire, CEO and co-founder of Goldman Sachs-backed crypto finance company Circle, who was a panelist at the \u201cBuilding a Sustainable Crypto-Architecture\u201d talk, countered the obligatory crypto mongering (which will be detailed further below) by arguing that virtual currencies will be essential for surviving the digital age due to their decentralized nature:\n\u201cCrypto is fundamental to the future. [...] We need tamper-proof, resilient, decentralized infrastructure if we want society to survive the digital age.\u201d\nAllaire also commented on the stigma attached to cryptocurrencies. \u201cPeople throw around \u2018crypto\u2019 like it\u2019s a bad thing \u2014 it\u2019s scary,\u201d he said. \u201cGuess what? Cryptography is at the foundation of protecting modern society, human privacy. It\u2019s a fundamental tool of our cyber defenses. It\u2019s a fundamental tool of every corporation.\u201d\nFurthermore, Circle\u2019s CEO claimed that crypto can go hand in hand with centralized, conventional institutions like central banks. Allaire referenced Circle\u2019s stablecoin, which it co-launched with Coinbase in October, to support his argument:\n\u201cWe\u2019re huge proponents of central bank digital currency and we believed in that for a very long time. [...] Our view is that the creation of cryptocurrencies that are based on central bank money is happening in the private sector first. We launched USD Coin last fall. It\u2019s growing rapidly.\u201d\nJamie Dimon refused to take a victory lap after Bitcoin\u2019s fall, appeared positive about blockchain\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who famously said that he doesn\u2019t \u201creally give a s---\u201d about Bitcoin (BTC) in the past, was asked if he took any satisfaction when the cryptocurrency plunged in 2018. Dimon replied that he didn\u2019t.\nMoreover, the JPMorgan Chase CEO noted that he is pro-blockchain, despite the excessive hype around the technology. In his view, blockchain is a better replacement for certain online databases.\n\u201cBlockchain is a real technology \u2014 it\u2019s just a database we can all access that\u2019s kept up-to-date,\u201d Dimon told CNBC at the meeting.\nIndeed, the American investment bank has a history with blockchain. In October 2017, JPMorgan Chase announced its own blockchain-enabled system for global payments that will \u201csignificantly reduce\u201d the number of parties involved in the transaction chain, hence reducing remittance time \u201cfrom weeks to hours.\u201d Further, in May 2018, the bank filed a patent for a peer-to-peer payment network based on blockchain.\nIn October 2018, the research group ResearchAndMarkets.com (RM) published a study claiming that blockchain is a key technology for JPMorgan Chase\u2019s development roadmap to become a major digital bank.\n\u2018Dr. Doom,\u2019 PayPal CEO, and others slammed crypto\nOther industry representatives appeared less collected in their remarks about crypto. Perhaps the harshest of them was New York-based economist Nouriel Roubini also known as \u201cDr. Doom,\u201d who introduced himself as the \u201cnumber one public critic of cryptocurrencies and blockchain\u201d during a panel hosted by crypto exchange LaToken.\nThe economist started off by referencing his testimony for a hearing of the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Community Affairs, which was released in October 2018. In it, he claimed that blockchain is \u201cno better than an Excel spreadsheet,\u201d a remark he recalled as being \u201cprovocative\u201d during his speech at the WEF forum. In the paper, Roubini also called crypto \u201cthe mother of all scams and bubbles\u201d and blockchain \u201cthe most over-hyped technology ever.\u201d\nFurther, speaking during the panel, Dr. Doom criticized the use of private distributed ledger technology (DLT), stressing that they are neither trustless nor decentralized and are falsely marketed as blockchains. He also pointed out that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) don\u2019t have anything to do with either blockchain or crypto.\nNouriel also harshly criticized what he described as the \u201ctokenization of everything,\u201d explaining that having a token for everything essentially implies going back to bartering. He also pointed out how the characters in the Flintstones cartoon, which is set in the Stone Age, have seashells for a single currency, arguing that tokenization is worse than that.\nPayPal CEO Dan Schulman also criticized Bitcoin, focusing on its limited use for retail purposes and scarce merchant adoption. However, he recognized the potential of blockchain.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing many retailers at all accept any of the cryptocurrencies. But I think the underlying technology is interesting,\u201d Schulman argued during an interview with CNBC. He then carried on to stress the technology\u2019s importance over the digital assets it supports:\n\u201cI have always thought that crypto was more of a reward mechanism for implementing blockchain, as opposed to really a currency.\u201d\nSchulman has expressed his skepticism about cryptocurrencies in the past. Specifically, in January 2018, he said that PayPal\u2019s mobile payment service, Venmo, has no plans for crypto due to its volatility:\n\u201cThe volatility of the cryptocurrency [Bitcoin] makes it actually unsuitable to be a real currency that retailers can accept.\u201d\nAnother WEF attendee, Huw van Steenis, who is the senior adviser to Bank of England governor Mark Carney, told Bloomberg that he is not worried about cryptocurrencies, curiously naming their speed as one of the main shortcomings:\n\u201cI\u2019m not so worried about cryptocurrencies. They fail the basic tests of financial services. They\u2019re not a great unit of exchange. They don\u2019t hold value, and they\u2019re slower.\u201d\nRipple\u2019s CEO subtly called out Joseph Lubin on centralization\nThe panel dubbed \u201cWhere is Blockchain Headed in 2019?\u201d saw both Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Joseph Lubin, a co-founder of Ethereum (ETH) and founder of the blockchain company ConsenSys, featured in the expert panel. While the discussing was overall tranquil, at one point, a light contention occured.\nWhen the panel host, Robert Hackett of Fortune magazine, asked Lubin to elaborate on how he manages ConsenSys\u2019 and his personal treasuries, Lubin replied that there would be no comment from him, adding that the assumption that he is one of the biggest ETH holders is \u201cbased on no data.\u201d\nAt that point, Garlinghouse stepped in, claiming that Ripple is \u201cattacked for being transparent,\u201d referring to quarterly XRP markets report, the latest of which was presented soon after the talk:\n\u201cBecause we share them [market reports] we\u2019re attacked for it, yet other platforms don\u2019t share that information, so they\u2019re insulated from the same critiques and criticisms. I think in the dictionary that\u2019s called \u2018hypocrisy.\u2019 I\u2019m not 100% sure, but it\u2019s close\u201d.\nThe moderator then asked whether ConsenSys has plans for greater transparency, to which Lubin replied that they\u2019re a private company, and he has not considered releasing information about its operating costs. \u201cRipple is a private company, too,\u201d Garlinghouse interjected.\nBlockchain\u2019s potential for the health care industry was highlighted\nOne of the panels centering on blockchain was dedicated to the health care industry specifically. Titled \u201cBlockchain in Healthcare Insurance and Beyond,\u201d it featured Lata Varghese, the head of blockchain at the U.S. IT corporation Cognizant, and Zia Zaman, the chief of innovations Asia at global insurance provider Metlife, as experts.\nThe talk\u2019s moderator asked to focus on real-life use cases for blockchain, aiming to \u201ccut through the hype.\u201d The panelists mentioned Vitana, a blockchain-powered insurance solution for diabetes sufferers developed by Singapore-based digital innovation center Lumenlab, as one of the examples.\nAdditionally, the talk covered other benefits that blockchain can bring into the health care insurance industry, like speeding up insurance claim payments and better access to patients\u2019 records.", "birthday": "2019-01-28T13:05:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-28 13:05:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 28}

According to the company, applications can be verified in as little as 24 hours.\nSaving customers time\nIllustrating why its app will prove to be a boon for time-pressed crypto customers, Netcoins has shown how users have the opportunity to skip steps and acquire the altcoins they desire much faster than what many popular exchanges can provide.\nFor example, customers who want to buy Pareto on the platform can do so directly as soon as they have funded their account with their local fiat currency \u2014 with euros, Canadian dollars and U.S. dollars accepted. Netcoins argues that this is in stark contrast to other exchanges, which often have slower turnaround times, a limited selection of coins, no facility for storing fiat, or a requirement that purchases are made using Bitcoin or Ethereum first. Usually, users have to jump through several hoops: They purchase Bitcoin first to obtain USDC before they can convert it to Pareto. With Netcoins, it\u2019s a simple direct fiat to Pareto process, the company says.\nNetcoins is hoping to move away from the status quo, which sees crypto consumers relying on exchanges that pair Bitcoin or Ethereum with the altcoins or tokens they want to purchase. By removing this step altogether, Netcoins believes the process of buying less common cryptocurrencies \u2014 such as Steem, Cloak, and others \u2014 will be far easier, and this could help drive adoption and demand.\nA global network\nNetcoins\u2019 new app sees the Vancouver-based company enhance its offering even further \u2014 and as reported by Cointelegraph toward the end of last year, the platform has already amassed a global retail network of over 170,000 locations in 53 countries. These stores enable anyone to walk in and buy cryptocurrencies using fiat \u2014 offering customers peace of mind and providing a less-complicated method than the arduous registration processes associated with some major exchanges.", "birthday": "2019-01-28T13:22:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-28 13:22:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 28}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nThe trend in crypto continues to be down. After a period of low volatility, cryptocurrencies are again headed south. There are no takers for cryptocurrencies even after such a huge fall because money is moving back into the traditional safe haven, gold, according to Jan Van Eck, CEO of Van Eck Associates.\nThe demand for funds from crypto companies is on the rise. Michael Novogratz backed Galaxy Digital is planning to raise $250 million for loans to crypto companies by March. Most large investment banks and funds are dipping their feet into these companies but Nouriel Roubini still believes that blockchain \u201cis no better than Excel spreadsheet.\u201d\nIran wants to use cryptocurrencies to circumvent recent U.S. sanctions. The Islamic Republic plans to issue a state-backed cryptocurrency, which it hopes will bypass the existing global messaging system \u201cSWIFT\u201d that facilitates cross-border payments.\nWhile we are upbeat on the crypto space for the long-term, the price action in the short-term continues to be depressing. The market has still not found a solid bottom and initiating positions in a downtrend is not a good strategy. How far will cryptocurrencies plunge? Let\u2019s find out.\nBTC/USD\nSimilar to the previous occasion in mid-Nov. of last year, the tight range in Bitcoin (BTC) has resolved to the downside. The bears will now attempt to break down of the yearly low at $3,236.09 and resume the downtrend, while the bulls will try to defend it.\n\nThe price is below both the moving averages and the RSI is close to the oversold level, which suggests that the bears are in command. Every pullback is likely to face selling at the moving averages and above it at the downtrend line.\nBelow $3,236.09, the BTC/USD pair can fall to $3,000, which is a psychological support. If this level also fails to hold, the downtrend can extend to $2,600 and below that to $2,400.\nOur bearish view will be invalidated if the digital currency rebounds sharply from $3,236.09 and stages a sharp recovery. We shall wait for the trend to change before recommending any trade in it.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) plunged below the $0.30550 to the $0.31 support zone on Jan. 27, after which selling intensified.\n\nThe immediate support is at $0.27795, below which a retest of the yearly low of $0.24508 is likely. The trend is clearly down as both the moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is close to the oversold level.\nThe XRP/USD pair will exhibit strength if the bulls push the price above the downtrend line and both the moving averages. We shall wait for a new buy setup to form before proposing a trade in it.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) broke down and closed (UTC time frame) below the strong support at $116.30 on Jan. 27. It can now slide to $100, which is a psychological support, below which a retest of $83 is possible.\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the RSI has dropped close to the oversold zone, which indicates that the sellers have an upper hand.\nThe ETH/USD pair will show a sign of recovery if the price sustains above the moving averages. We shall wait for a trend reversal pattern to develop before recommending a trade in it. \u00a0\u00a0\nEOS/USD\nEOS has turned down from the moving averages. The bears are currently attempting to break down of the support at $2.1733. If successful, the decline can extend to $1.7746 and below it to $1.55.\n\nHowever, both the moving averages are flat, which points to a likely consolidation. If the bulls defend the support at $2.1733, the EOS/USD pair will remain range bound. We might suggest a trade if the price sustains above $2.60. Until then, we remain neutral on it.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) broke below the tight range of $141\u2013 $121.3 on Jan. 27. It is currently just below the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the up move from $73.50 to $239.\n\nIf this support breaks, a 100 percent retracement of the up move is probable. There is minor support at the psychological support at $100 but it is unlikely to hold.\nThe 20-day EMA has turned down and the RSI has reached close to the oversold level, which shows that the sellers have the upper hand. We shall wait for the BCH/USD pair to form a reversal pattern before turning positive on it. Until then, we suggest traders remain on the sidelines.\nLTC/USD\nThe attempt by the bulls to push Litecoin (LTC) above the top of the tight range at $33 failed on Jan. 26.\n\nCurrently, the bears are attempting to sink the LTC/USD pair below the support zone at $29.349 and $27.701. Unless the whole crypto universe plunges, we expect the bulls to defend the above-mentioned support levels. Hence, we suggest traders retain their stops at $27.50. If the bears sink the price below $27.50, a retest of the low at $23.090 will be in the cards. The cryptocurrency will gain strength if the price closes (UTC time frame) above $33.\nTRX/USD\nTron (TRX) triggered our buy recommendation on Jan. 26 when it closed above the resistance of its long-term range.\n\nHowever, the fall in the crypto space has dragged it back into the range once again. It is currently trying to hold the 20-day EMA. If the support holds, the bulls will again attempt to push the price above the range.\nHowever, if the TRX/USD pair plunges below the 20-day EMA, it will be a negative sign. Therefore, traders who are long should keep a stop loss at $0.023. If the bears sink below $0.023, the slide can extend to the 50-day SMA and below that to $0.0183. The trend turns negative if the bears force the price below $0.0183.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) has broken down of the yearly low at $0.09285498. This is a negative sign. Both the moving averages are trending down and the RSI is close to the oversold level, which shows that supply exceeds demand.\n\nIf the XLM/USD pair closes (UTC time frame) below $0.09285498, it can decline to $0.07864971 and below that to $0.05795397.\nConversely, if the bulls quickly push the price back above $0.09285498, it can move up to the downtrend line. We shall wait for a bullish pattern to form before turning positive on it.\nBSV/USD\nAfter a period of low volatility, the range has expanded to the downside.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-tech-and-the-energy-industry-more-decentralization-and-greater-efficiency", "title": " Blockchain Tech and the Energy Industry: More Decentralization and Greater Efficiency ", "content": "\u00a0\n\nThe association between blockchains and energy is usually a negative one. \u201cThe Bitcoin blockchain is so wasteful of electricity,\u201d or so the argument goes, \u201cthat it would push global warming to dangerous levels if it were ever used on a massive scale.\u201d Research published in the influential journal Nature backs up this warning. Yet, if we were to look beyond Bitcoin, it becomes apparent that blockchains in general are being increasingly put to good use by the energy industry.\nFrom their use in energy trades to their incorporation in microgrids, distributed ledgers are making possible a range of new transactions and systems. By enabling micro-suppliers to receive quick and easy payments for contributing electricity to a network, they're increasing the decentralization of the energy industry, with consumers likely to see their bills become cheaper as a consequence of their entry.\nAnd a similar effect will hopefully be the outcome of allowing energy giants to trade with each other using blockchains, since increases in efficiency and security can hopefully be passed on to consumers in the form of lower energy prices \u2014 although there's always the risk that energy companies will simply take bigger profits for themselves.\nMicrogrids\nThe most exciting use of blockchain in the energy industry \u2014 and the one that fits best with the whole ethos of decentralization \u2014 comes in the context of microgrids. Even before Bitcoin and blockchain, such grids have been distributed by definition, comprising smaller sources of energy generation (e.g., wind turbines, solar farms) that link together in localized networks in order to provide electricity that isn't dependent on centralized power plants and utility companies.\nHowever, while the microgrid market has been forecasted by Navigant Consulting to grow to around $30 billion by 2030, projected growth has actually stalled in recent years, with Navigant's research director, Peter Asmus, telling Microgrid Knowledge in August that \"the overall spend is declining\" relative to predictions made in 2014. Fortunately, blockchain and distributed ledger technology will increasingly help to kickstart the sector's growth in the coming years, as it offers a number of advantages over alternative ways of delivering microgrids.\nFor one, the use of blockchain tech promises to increase interoperability between the numerous energy sources, suppliers and customers that make up microgrids. In particular, this is the aim being pursued by the Energy Web Foundation (EWF), an international nonprofit organization that, according to its director of marketing, Peter Bronski, is bringing blockchain tech to all areas of the energy industry.\n\"EWF is actually building a core blockchain \u2014 similar to but importantly distinct from Ethereum \u2014 specifically tailored to the energy sector and the industry's unique regulatory, operational, and market needs: the Energy Web Chain,\" he tells Cointelegraph.\n\"It'll come as no surprise, I suspect, that blockchain offers significant cybersecurity and decentralization benefits to the energy sector. Globally, the energy sector is amidst a fundamental transition from a centralized electricity grid with a relatively small number of very large power plants to a decentralized, low-carbon electricity grid with billions of connected devices such as rooftop solar panels, batteries, smart thermostats, electric vehicles, etc. Blockchain, and especially the Energy Web Chain, is very well suited to helping managing that future grid.\"\nAlready released in beta and expecting its genesis block in the second quarter of 2019, one of the advantages offered to microgrids by the Energy Web Chain is the ability to use smart contracts to efficiently monitor the production and distribution of (renewable) energy. \"For example, whenever a large-scale renewable energy generator such as wind farm or solar farm generates a megawatt-hour of clean electricity, that can trigger the generation of a renewable energy certificate (REC),\" Bronski explains. \"The creation and ownership tracking of RECs is a great use case for blockchain technology.\"\nIt's a testament to the promise shown by EWF and its Energy Web Chain that a number of big corporations have already signed up to use and partner with the platform. In November, Siemens joined EWF as a member, while the foundation also counts the likes of Shell, E.On, Centrica, Engine and Iberdrola as affiliates. And as Stefan Jessenberger at Siemens Digital Grid explains to Cointelegraph, blockchain won\u2019t simply enable greater security and efficiency, but also the possibility for changing how energy companies and producers operate:\n\"In our view, the blockchain technology might revolutionize the way DERs [distributed energy resources], grid operators and marketplaces will interact in a secure, efficient and transparent way while also enabling new business models. Especially in combination with artificial intelligence, advanced forecasting algorithms and the usage of geographical information of the assets, the technology offers promising capabilities in order to enable the autonomous trading of energy and flexibility, while incorporating the locational value of DER\u2019s and loads.\u201d\nIn addition to heightened efficiency and transparency, a key ingredient in the creation of new business models is blockchain\u2019s ability to enable small producers of energy to be paid quickly for their contributions to grids.\nFor example, in September, Australian company Vicinity Centres announced that it would begin using a blockchain-based delivery platform for the small energy networks it runs in shopping malls throughout Australia. This platform has been built by Power Ledger, and it will enable Vicinity\u2019s malls to sell energy to nearby residents and consumers. And to do this, the platform will make use of its native Sparkz token, an ERC-20 token which enables producers and customers to engage in \u201cfrictionless\u201d trades with each other without having to rely on intermediaries.\n\nTrading energy\nAside from offering a secure record of transactions and also rewards for producers, blockchain tech is set to serve the energy industry in other ways. One of its most significant uses will be in the area of energy markets, where oil, gas, coal and other sources of energy are traded between producers, distributors and financial institutions.\nIt's here that Vakt operates, having established itself in June 2018 with the aim of creating a \"post-trade processing platform\" for any kind of tradable commodity, including energy. In November, it launched its first usable platform, which will, for the time being, allow for the recording of trades in oil, but which Vakt plans to expand to \"all physically traded energy commodities.\"\nFor a company that has only just launched its first product, Vakt boasts some high-profile users \u2014 including BP, Shell, Equinor, Gunvor and Mercuria \u2014 which will all use Vakt's platform in parallel with their internal systems for recording trades. The post-trade platform will run on J.P. Morgan's Quorum blockchain, which is essentially a permissioned version of Ethereum that allows for private \u2014 as well as public \u2014 smart contracts and also for zero-knowledge proofs. This makes it convenient for any enterprise that doesn't want to broadcast the value of its purchases and trade deals to the world, while Vakt itself advertises that its platform will offer up to \"40% savings across operations\" as a result of putting details on a shared ledger.\n\nSpeaking at the time of the launch, Shell's executive vice president of trading and supply, Andrew Smith, explained in broad terms what he expects blockchain tech to bring to the industry.\n\"Digitalisation is changing how the energy value chain works. It\u2019s an exciting time. Collaboration with our peers and some of the industry\u2019s key players is the best way to combine market expertise and achieve the scale necessary to launch a digital transaction platform that could transform the way we all do business. Ultimately the aim is improved speed and security, which benefits everyone along the supply chain from market participants to customers.\"", "birthday": "2019-01-28T20:32:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-28 20:32:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 28}

We decided to look into the last six years for Venezuela and the fate of the Petro \u2014 a national cryptocurrency that was founded to save the agonizing economy, but eventually caused even more resentment.\nThe legacy of Hugo Chavez\nHugo Chavez, a seemingly irreplaceable Venezuelan leader, who was in power since 1999, passed away after a long battle with cancer in March, 2013. A committed socialist and revolutionary, Chavez was held in high esteem and loved by Venezuelans for his continuous attempts to eliminate poverty and inequality. Thousands of citizens attending his funeral in an overcrowded Caracas, bearing witness to that fact.\nAccording to the stats unveiled by the Guardian, between 1999 and 2009, the Venezuelan government has managed to reduce unemployment from 14.5 percent to 7.6 percent, increase GDP per capita from $4,105 to $10,810, and drop the extreme poverty rate from 23.4 percent to 8.5 percent. The indigenous peoples of Venezuela \u2014 who form somewhere around 2 percent of the country\u2019s population \u2014 were among those who benefited most from Chavez\u2019s presidency. While he was in charge, Venezuela shifted toward protecting their rights and granting them fundamental freedoms. \u00a0\nNonetheless, instead of reforming the Venezuelan economy that has always been dependent on oil, Chavez decided to proclaim an \u201ceconomic war\u201d and accused \u201cthe bourgeoisie owners\u201d of local farms, supermarkets and mills of concealing food in order to destabilize his government.\nMaduro\u2019s Guerra: From socialism to an usurpation of power\nWhen Maduro entered office in 2013, he inherited one of the most shaky economies in the whole South American region.\nAs of data provided by an online stats and market research website Statista, the average inflation rate in 2012 \u2014 the year preceding to Maduro\u2019s presidency \u2014 was around 21 percent. Despite the fact that the year was relatively stable for Maduro\u2019s administration, his actions only drove Venezuela closer to the brink of the abyss.\nIn fact, during Maduro\u2019s first year, his government continued Chavez\u2019s economic war, blaming wealthy businessmen of hoarding goods and pushing up prices. The policy was supported by Venezuelan lawmakers, who gave Maduro special decree powers in order to enforce price control in November, 2013. Still, by the end of 2013, the average inflation rate had climbed up to 43.5 percent.\nBut the real crisis emerged in 2014, when crude oil prices lost almost 40 percent in just six months. Maduro\u2019s government first saw mass protests led by the Democratic Unity Roundtable (or MUD in Spanish). The participants of the marches that started February, 2014 accused officials of corruption, shortages and failure to prevent inflation. As the clashes between protesters and the Venezuelan army became more and more violent \u2014 with over 40 people reportedly being killed in just two months \u2014 Maduro\u2019s supporters faced accusations of excessive use of force, while many demanded the resignation of the president himself.\nBy 2015, the average inflation rate got close to 68.5 percent, while Maduro yet again blamed unscrupulous businesses for shortages and price hikes. In addition to that, Venezuela\u2019s GDP that year shrank to 3.9 percent, as of data provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nIn December, 2015, the Democratic Unity Roundtable won the congressional elections and became the largest group in the National Assembly, Venezuela\u2019s unicameral parliament. The opposition soon focused on holding a referendum that would force Maduro to leave his post amid the inflation that has more than doubled in 2015, reaching 111 percent. However, the Supreme Court backed Maduro, cut the Assembly\u2019s power, and the decision on referendum has been stuck in bureaucracy. The Venezuelan parliament then voted to begin impeachment proceedings against Maduro for violating democracy and urged the army to disobey the government in late October 2016.\nIn 2016, Maduro\u2019s presidency was first labeled as a dictatorship. For instance, following a new twist in the political crisis, Forbes posted a story entitled \u201cSorry bond lords, Venezuela is a dictatorship now,\u201d while the Guardian came up with an article called \u201cLet\u2019s call Venezuela what it is under Maduro: a dictatorship\u201d later that year. Also in 2016, a chilling poll conducted by several local universities showed that Venezuelans barely consumed the 2,000 recommended daily calories needed, and 75 percent of citizens had lost around 19 pounds that year due to the crisis.\n\nIn 2017, the high court finally took all the power from the National Assembly, practically dissolving the body, which was considered a coup by the opposition. The decision sparked outrage in all segments of society, exhausted by long-term shortages, hyperinflation and even hunger. Starting in April, numerous marches broke out in Venezuela, once in a while brutally suppressed by government forces. The Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict calculated that the country saw over 6,000 manifestations from April until late July, with more than 160 people killed in clashes.\nIn the summer, a member of the forensic police, Oscar Perez, stole a police helicopter, flew it to the center of Venezuelan capital, dropped grenades on the Supreme Court, and fired several shots at the Ministry of the Interior. Perez, dubbed a \u201cterrorist\u201d by Maduro, managed to flee the city, and headed an armed resistance until he was killed during an army raid in January, 2018.\nIn July, Maduro finally created the Constituent Assembly \u2014 a body set up to draft and adopt a new constitution in order to provide stability and cease the protests, according to the president. The measure was heavily criticized both by the European Union, South American trading body Mercosur, the Organization of American States \u2014 which includes both the United States and Mexico. The latter tightened sanctions against Maduro, who was accused of holding \u201csham\u201d elections.\nIn the meantime, the opposition conducted a long-awaited unofficial referendum against Maduro, with 7 million Venezuelans reportedly participating in it. According to the calculations, 98 percent of voters did not want a new constitution.\nVenezuela approached 2018 with growing geopolitical tension, the ongoing violation of rights and freedoms, along with a mass exodus of Venezuelans \u2014 since 2014 more than 2 million locals left the country. The average inflation rate in 2017 surpassed 1,000 percent, and the GDP lost 14 percent, as per the IMF. Nonetheless, Maduro appeared to have a trick up his sleeve.\nPetro takes the field\nMaduro first mentioned the Petro, a Venezuelan cryptocurrency reportedly backed by oil, late in December, 2017. The leader claimed that crypto, which is not controlled by any government, could help Venezuela to shore up its struggling economy and to circumvent U.S. sanctions. In January, 2018, the Petro\u2019s rate was tied to one barrel of oil, and the issuance of the first 100 million coins was ordered. Initially, the industry treated the measure as a first-ever \u201cbitcoinization\u201d of a sovereign state.\nThroughout 2018, the national cryptocurrency set to stop the hyperinflation was actively promoted by the government. On an international level, Maduro asked 10 countries in the Bolivarian Alliance \u2014 including Cuba \u2014 to support his initiative. Later that year, he claimed that the Petro will be used for international commercial transactions, although he avoided mentioning the countries that agreed to accept the oil-backed currency.\nIn addition to this, the oil-rich country was reportedly going to present the Petro to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 2019, as a unit of account. Maduro even offered the Petro to Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. Nonetheless, Moscow, which had always been supportive of Venezuela\u2019s domestic policies both by diplomacy and investments, refused to accept the Petro as a unit of account.\nMeanwhile, within the country, the Petro was actively used as a tool against poverty, social injustice and hyperinflation. Venezuela launched the creation of the Petro-funded crypto bank for youth initiatives, which claimed to use the Petro to fund housing for homeless, obliged citizens to pay passport fees in oil-backed currency, and \u2014 prior to the official launch of coin\u2019s circulation \u2014 made it a unit of account for salaries, goods and services.\nBut the experts studying the Petro were far from optimistic. An alarming Reuter's report \u2014 dubbed \u201cIn Venezuela, new cryptocurrency is nowhere to be found\u201d \u2014 was published in late August. In it, the news agency stated that the Petro was not currently traded on any of the major global crypto exchanges. Moreover, the journalists doubted that it was actually backed with Venezuelan oil. The report claimed that Atapirire \u2014 an area that Maduro defined as an actual petroleum center for backing the coin \u2014 didn\u2019t indicate any recent activity. \u201cThere is no sign of that petro here,\u201d locals told the agency. The former Oil Minister, Rafael Ramirez, expressed his opinion writing that \"the Petro [...] only exists in the government\u2019s imagination.\u201d\n\nU.S. tech media outlet Wired also spoke to local and South American experts. Jorge Farias, the CEO of Venezuelan startup Cryptobuyer, revealed the state-owned currency was, in fact, backed by national oil company PDVSA, which had $45 billion in debt and showed no signs of any trading activity. Roger Benites, the CEO of Lima-based crypto exchange BitInka, called the Petro a \u201csmoke curtain\u201d to conceal Maduro's failure to reanimate the national fiat currency by devaluating it. Corre Innovation\u2019s Dickie Armour shared his stance, dubbing the Petro a \u201cstunt.\u201d\nBy the time the Petro was finally launched in November, following a series of delays, both Venezuelans and experts doubted its real value and, overall, existence. While crypto enthusiasts studied the Petro\u2019s white paper and came to a conclusion that it blatantly copied some parts of Dash\u2019s documentation available in the GitHub repository, Maduro was forced to increase the Petro\u2019s value from 3,600 to 9,000 bolivars in the midst of ongoing inflation.\nSince the pension bonuses were converted into Petro, the country faced another protest, this time led by seniors who did not believe in the oil-backed coin. \u201cI don\u2019t want Petro, I want my cash,\u201d said one of the protesters.\nDespite all the efforts, by the end of 2018m the Petro was still \u201cnowhere to be found\u201d \u2014 the coin was not listed by any of the major exchanges, nor was it accepted by any of country\u2019s allies. Venezuela\\s economy kept drowning, as the inflation rate, according to the most conservative estimates by IMF, climbed up to 1.37 million percent by the end of the year. The opposition, though, provided much more gloomy data \u2014 1.7 million percent in 2018, which, in fact, converted Venezuela into one of the three countries with the highest inflation rates in history.\nThe grand finale: Maduro vs. Guaido\nIn May, 2018, Maduro was re-elected for his second six-year term during a vote that had shown the lowest turnout \u2014 equalling 40 percent \u2014 since Venezuela\u2019s democracy was restored in 1958. As the two main candidates opposing Maduro, Henri Falcon and Javier Bertucci, rejected the results and reported critical irregularities, the disgraced National Assembly also denied the results, calling them an \"electoral farce.\"", "birthday": "2019-01-29T02:55:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-29 02:55:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 29}

As a result of the funding package he signed on Friday, the government will be open for three weeks.\nWhile the future still seems unclear for U.S. government facilities, which are now returning to work after the 35-day standoff between Trump and the Senate, it is time to reassess how regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) were affected, and what that means for the crypto market.\nTrump failed to get money for his border wall, shut down the U.S. government\nThe shutdown was triggered by Trump's demand for $5.7 billion in federal funds for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, which he called for throughout his 2016 presidential campaign, making it one of his signature promises.\nInitially, Trump claimed he would recoup the costs of the wall from Mexico, but President Enrique Pena Nieto refused to fund the construction. As a result, in January 2017, the Trump administration signed Executive Order 13767, which formally directed the U.S. government to build the wall using existing federal funding.\nIn December 2018, the Senate, which is controlled by the Republican party, unanimously passed an appropriations bill without wall funding. After that, Trump declared that he wouldn't sign any funding bill that didn't include money for the fortified border. According to Politico reports, Trump\u2019s decision could have been influenced by conservative and far-right media outlets, which purportedly pressured the president to keep his longtime promise.\nThe House republicans then pushed a stopgap bill with funding for the wall by a 217-185 vote, but it also failed to find enough support in the Senate.\nDuring what seems to be the highlight of the dispute preceding the shutdown, on Dec. 11, Trump met with Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and asked them to support an appropriation of $5.7 billion for funding of the border wall. After they rejected his proposal, Trump said, \"I am proud to shut down the government for border security. [...] I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it. [...] I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down.\" Ten days later, Trump took to Twitter to blame Democrats for the shutdown.\nAs a result, on Dec. 22, the shutdown started, as funding for numerous agencies, homeland security, law enforcement, tax collection and transportation expired. Approximately 800,000 federal workers were furloughed or were required to work without pay. The shutdown reportedly affected one quarter of the government. According to an analysis from Standard & Poor's, by Jan.11, the shutdown had cost the U.S. economy $3.6 billion. Given that it lasted 14 more days and became the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, the overall effect could be even more significant.\nThe SEC was largely paralyzed, delaying the IPO applications and possibly triggering insider trading\nOn Dec. 27, the SEC announced that it will operate with reduced staff during the shutdown.\n\u201cEffective Thursday, Dec. 27 and until further notice, the agency will have a very limited number of staff members available,\u201d the regulator announced via its website. The SEC added that it will keep essential staff to respond to emergency situations involving market integrity and investor protection.\nAdditionally, the regulator maintained operations for its offices of enforcement and investor complaints, as well as its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) system for company disclosures.\nAccording to data from intelligence firm Enigma Technologies cited by Quartz, the SEC was operating at 5.8 percent of its normal capacity during the shutdown, with the enforcement division at 8 percent.\nIn a comment for Quartz, John Stark, the former chief of the SEC\u2019s Office of Internet Enforcement, called the numbers \u201cshocking\u201d and predicted an increase in insider trading during the shutdown:\n\u201cThere will absolutely be people on Wall Street, and off of Wall Street, who believe they may be able to get away with something because the cop is simply not on the beat.\u201d\nMoreover, Stark stressed that the SEC was underemployed even before the shutdown, which means that the lapse could have made it even more complicated for the watchdog to keep up with the market. It could take months to deal with the backlog, he argued, considering that SEC enforcement staff were allegedly not even permitted to read their emails. \u201cEven if they wanted to work from home and get work done, it\u2019s unlawful for them to do so,\u201d the former SEC employee added.\nAnother former SEC employee, its ex-accountant/examiner Tim Dunn, told Quartz that the most \u201cessential\u201d SEC staff who remained on the job were of senior level. Therefore, they were unlikely to review cases, he argued.\n\u201cHow far away are they from hands-on working these important cases, and are they working them? [...] Somebody who is in senior management is probably six, eight, ten years removed from actually having done that work.\u201d\nThe halt could have encouraged wrongdoing among market participants, according to James Cox, a securities law professor at Duke University, who was also interviewed by Quartz. Cox highlighted insider trading as one of primary examples of such offense, claiming that it accounts for 10 percent of all enforcement cases. He argued that the SEC was forced to handpick cases during the shutdown due to the lack of employees at work, which could have been abused by the market:\n\u201cThat sends out a message to people on Wall Street \u2014 \u2018Hey, maybe there\u2019s less chance of me being caught right now,\u2019 and that has all kinds of perverse incentives.\u201d\nOn Jan. 27, 2019, after the shutdown was temporarily ended, the SEC issued transition guidance that explains how the staff will tackle the backlog of transactional and disclosure filings, as well as shareholder proposals that piled up during the shutdown.\nAccording to the guidance, the staff will prioritize filings, submissions and requests for staff action, including shareholder proposals, in the order they were received. The papers also cautions that the SEC response times may be longer than usual.\nThe initial public offerings (IPO) market has taken a hit as a result of the shutdown, according to the transaction guidance. Specifically, the applications of companies seeking to go public in the first quarter of 2019 have been delayed. The list of such firms include China\u2019s second-largest Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer, Canaan, who turned to New York after its $400 million plans were lapsed by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX).\nThe CFTC\u2019s action was halted as well, pushing back its review of ETH and digital assets platforms\u2019 applications\nThe CFTC, the agency that oversees the derivatives market and trading in Bitcoin futures, was largely shutdown as well. On Dec. 18, the agency released a memo announcing that it will \u201cseverely curtail\u201d its operations. Only 9.1 percent of the CFTC\u2019s staff remained at work during the shutdown, as per the statement.\nNevertheless, the regulator sought stay of actions against binary options and virtual currency fraudsters. On Dec. 26, it reportedly filed respective motions with federal courts.\nOne example of the cases that the CFTC wanted to keep investigating allegedly featured a number of companies that were accused of having solicited potential customers to buy illegal off-exchange binary options via companies such as Blue Bit Banc. The defendants reportedly aimed to cover up their misdemeanor by asking customers to transfer their binary options account balances into the ATM Coin (ATMC) cryptocurrency.\nThe shutdown could have also indefinitely prolonged the CFTC\u2019s studies in regard to Ethereum (ETH).\nOn Dec. 11, the watchdog requested public comments and guidance on the Ethereum blockchain to better understand the differences and similarities between ETH and the seminal cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC). According to a Roll Coll report, while the comment submission period won\u2019t expire until mid-February, there was no CFTC staff in office to begin undertaking the review.", "birthday": "2019-01-29T14:17:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-29 14:17:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 29}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nThe highly-anticipated Bitcoin ETF proposal by VanEck and SolidX partners to list on CBOE's BZX exchange was withdrawn on Jan. 23 due to the ongoing government shutdown. VanEck's founder and CEO, Jan Van Eck, told CNBC that they can allay many of SEC\u2019s concerns but they \u201ccan\u2019t have meetings when they\u2019re shutdown.\u201d The proposal will be resubmitted after the shutdown ends. Bitcoin has not reacted to this news, which is a positive sign.\nThe leading cryptocurrency has been stuck in a tight range for the past few days. Its 14-day volatility plummeted to its lowest level since mid-November, according to U.S. asset manager Blockforce Capital. This period of low volatility will be followed by another expansion in volatility.\nThough it is difficult to predict which way the price will escape, analysts at JP Morgan believe that Bitcoin can plunge to $2,400 and below that to $1,260. According to them, using crypto in the real world is a challenge. They could pinpoint any major retailer who accepted crypto in 2018.\nAdditionally, the analysts do not expect banks to benefit from blockchain technology at least for another three to five years. These forecasts should be taken with a pinch of salt because the investment bank\u2019s CEO, Jamie Dimon has been one of the most vocal high-profile critics of cryptocurrencies.\nCardano\u2019s (ADA) founder, Charles Hoskinson anticipates cryptocurrencies will take more than a decade to reach their 2017 highs. However, by then, he expects the markets to mature and solve most of the problems plaguing it.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) has been trading close to the $3,500 level since Jan. 11. Attempts to move away from this price level have been unsuccessful. The price is trading below both the moving averages, which are trending down. This shows that sellers have the upper hand. \u00a0\n\nThe downtrend will resume if the BTC/USD pair plunges below $3,236.09. A breakdown will dent the sentiment severely and scare away investors who are waiting on the sidelines to enter.\nIf the bulls push the price above both the moving averages, a rally to $4,000 and above it to $4,255 is probable. We might suggest long positions if the price sustains above the downtrend line. Until then, we remain in a wait-and-watch mode.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) is in a weak downtrend. Both the moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone. This shows that the bears are at an advantage.\n\nThe immediate support on the downside is in the $0.30550\u2013 $0.31 zone. A break below this zone can plunge the XRP/USD pair to the next support at $0.27795. If that support also breaks, the fall can extend to $0.24508.\nThe cryptocurrency will show signs of a possible recovery if it breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above the 50-day SMA. We retain our buy suggested in the previous analysis.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) has not been able to bounce off the strong support at $116.30 for the past few days. This suggests a lack of demand at higher levels.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone. This means the path of least resistance in the short term is to the downside. If the ETH/USD pair closes (UTC time frame) below $116.30, it will turn negative and slide to $100. If $100 also fails to offer support, the next target on the downside is $83.\nOur bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls bounce off of current levels and push prices above $134.50. We do not find any reliable buy setups at current levels; hence, we are not recommending any trade in it.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has been trading in a tight range of $141\u2013$121.30 since Jan. 11. The next move will start when the price escapes from this range.\n\nA breakout and close above $141 can carry the BCH/USD pair to $177.30 and above it to $239. Therefore, traders can look to buy on a close (UTC time frame) above $141 with a stop just below $115.\nHowever, if the bears sink the cryptocurrency below $121.3, it can correct to $100 and below that to $73.50.\nEOS/USD\nEOS has been trading close to the 20-day EMA for the past four days. Both the moving averages are flat and the RSI is just below the 50 level. This points to a balance between the buyers and the sellers.\n\nThe balance will tilt in favor of the bulls if the price breaks out of the moving average and $2.5944. The breakout can result in a rally to the overhead resistance zone of $3.05 to $3.2081.\nOn the other hand, if the EOS/USD pair turns down from the current level and plummets below $2.1733, it can drop to $1.7746 and below it to $1.55. We shall wait for the price to sustain above $2.60 before suggesting any long positions.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) is likely to correct to the yearly low of $0.09285498. A breakdown of this final support will resume the downtrend. The downtrending moving averages and RSI in negative territory suggest that sellers have an upper hand.\n\nIf the XLM/USD pair bounces off the support at $0.09285498, it might move up to the downtrend line. A breakout of the 50-day SMA will indicate strength. The cryptocurrency might pick up momentum above $0.13427050. We shall wait for a trend reversal to form before proposing a trade in it.\nLTC/USD\nFrom the bottom of the tight range, the bulls carried Litecoin (LTC) to the top of the range. A breakout and close above $33 can push it to $36.428, followed by a move to $40. Therefore, we suggest traders keep a stop loss of $27.50 on their long positions.\n\nThe LTC/USD pair will turn negative if the bears sink the price below the support zone of $29.349 to $27.701. If this zone breaks, the drop can stretch to the yearly low of $23.090.\nA failure to breakout of the range will extend the consolidation by a few more days. The flat moving averages and the RSI close to 50 points to a balance between the buyers and the sellers.\nTRX/USD\nTron (TRX) is one of the stronger cryptocurrencies. It has been consolidating near the highs of the $0.0183\u2013$0.02815521 range for the past three days.\n\nConsolidation close to a resistance shows that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits. If the buyers push the price above $0.02815521, a new uptrend is likely. The target levels to watch on the upside are $0.03801042 and above it $0.04. We retain the buy recommendation provided in the previous analysis.\nConversely, if the TRX/USD pair reverses direction from current levels, it can correct to the 20-day EMA and below it to $0.02113440. \u00a0\nBSV/USD\nBitcoin SV (BSV) continues to trade in a tight range. After this low-volatility period, we expect the volatility to surge.\n", "birthday": "2019-01-25T19:58:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-25 19:58:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 25}

Specifically, the FCA aims to help them understand whether their digital assets of choice are within the regulatory perimeter, what regulations apply to their business and whether they need to be authorized with the agency.\nIn the paper, the regulator outlines various possible definitions of crypto assets and currently applicable U.K. laws. Specifically, the agency notes that crypto assets could be considered \u201cSpecified Investments\u201d under the state\u2019s Regulated Activities Order (RAO) or \u201cFinancial Instruments\u201d regulated by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II. The regulatory body also mentions that such assets could be subject to E-Money Regulations or Payment Services Regulations.\nThe FCA\u2019s consultation paper then breaks down cryptocurrencies into three potential categories: exchange tokens, security tokens and utility tokens.\nThus, as per the agency, exchange tokens are those \u201cnot issued or backed by any central authority and are intended and designed to be used as a means of exchange.\u201d The FCA cited the example of Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC) in the context of that particular type of digital asset, adding that exchange tokens are usually decentralized. Consequently, the regulator adds, such tokens can be used for the buying and selling of goods and services without the need for conventional intermediaries, such as banks.\nSecurity tokens, in turn, are assets that \u201care the same as or akin to traditional instruments like shares, debentures or units in a collective investment scheme.\u201d The FCA adds that such tokens likely fall under RAO and are hence \u201cwithin the perimeter\u201d of the watchdog\u2019s purview. The FCA avoided mentioning specific examples of such security tokens, but nonetheless outlined a more abstract example:\n\u201cFirm CD, incorporated in the UK, has created a social trading platform, called the CD Platform, for users to easily exchange fiat currencies for exchange tokens. The firm issues \u2018CD Tokens\u2019 which are exchanged for fiat funds and these tokens are used to purchase other exchange tokens.\u201d\nIn this scenario, the FCA writes, CD Tokens might be categorized as security tokens, as they \u201cconfer on the holder a right of ownership of the CD Platform.\u201d\nFinally, coins referred to as utility tokens are those that give users access to a product, but do not grant the same rights as security tokens \u2014 and hence are not covered by the regulatory regime, unless they can be classified as e-money by definition.\nThe FCA cites data previously obtained by the U.K. Cryptoassets Taskforce, noting that the country accommodates less than 15 crypto spot exchanges. Combined, they appear to have a daily trading volume of about $200 million \u2014 accounting for approximately 1 percent of the daily global trade in cryptocurrencies. Moreover, there are 56 projects in the U.K. that have held initial coin offerings (ICOs), which is less than 5 percent of projects globally. That implies that the domestic crypto market is still relatively small.\nHowever, despite the modest size of the U.K.\u2019s crypto industry, the local regulators have been intensifying their scrutiny: In December last year, the FCA revealed that it is investigating 18 companies over cryptocurrency use, while the U.K. tax collection service issued its first detailed tax legislation for private cryptocurrency holders. As for the FCA consultation paper, the agency is asking the public to weight in on the document and submit comments before April 5. The finalized version of the document will reportedly be presented by summer 2019.\nTherefore, the U.K. might soon join the list of countries that employ a definite regulatory approach toward cryptocurrencies. Some of those players, along with the ways in which they define digital assets, will be discussed below.\nJapan\nStatus of cryptocurrencies: legally-accepted means of payment\n\nJapan is one of the world\u2019s largest markets for cryptocurrencies. According to the data collected by the Financial Services Agency (FSA), the chief domestic financial regulator, the country has about 3.5 million crypto traders who conduct annual transactions to the amount of more than $97 billion. The majority of them are reportedly businessmen around the age of 30. Moreover, domestic reports show that around 14 percent \u043ef country\u2019s young male workforce has invested in cryptocurrencies.\nGiven the significant size of the Japanese crypto market, the FSA has been notably active there. As a result of its politics, the domestic market has gained the reputation of being one of the most compliant and regulation-oriented.\nAlso, Japan is one of the first countries to legally recognize Bitcoin. Thus, since May 2016, the cryptocurrency, along with other altcoins, can be used as a legally accepted means of payment in the country. However, cryptocurrencies are still not defined as legal tender in Japan. In April 2017, the local Payment Services Act came into force: The document confirmed cryptocurrencies\u2019 role as a form of payment and outlined further regulatory measures of local crypto exchanges and ICOs.\nIn December 2018, the FSA decided to place Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies under a single category dubbed \u201ccrypto-assets,\u201d according to reports from local media. The government was allegedly worried that, because cryptocurrencies were called \u201cvirtual currencies,\u201d traders were mislead into thinking that they were purchasing legal tender recognized by the government.\nChina\nStatus of cryptocurrencies: not recognized, banned for trading\n\nChina used to be an extremely significant player in the crypto market, hosting a substantial share of Bitcoin miners (in 2017, it was estimated that 50 to 70 percent of Bitcoin mining took place in the country) and Bitcoin trading volume. However, since the government's major crackdown on local exchanges and ICOs in September 2017, both figures have been significantly downplayed. Nevertheless, China has not abandoned crypto altogether and moved on to become a strictly blockchain power.\nThus, since the wave of regulatory repression took place, people in China can hold cryptocurrencies, but cannot legally exchange them for fiat money. According to the local government, domestic regulators do not recognize cryptocurrencies as legal tender or as a tool for retail payments, and the Chinese banking system is not accepting any cryptocurrencies.\nUnited States\nStatus of cryptocurrencies: varied, depends on the agency\n\nIn the U.S. Congress holds supreme power over federal regulatory agencies, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), discharging them to comply with the laws it issues.\nHowever, Congress has remained silent on the matter of regulating and defining cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, different regulatory agencies have taken the matter into their hands, with each regulatory body defining cryptocurrencies in its own way.\nThe SEC, the body that oversees securities transactions, mostly considers crypto as securities. According to the 70-year-old Howey Test, which the SEC applies to determine the purview of its jurisdiction, a security involves the investment of money in a common enterprise, in which the investor expects profits primarily from others' efforts. Nonetheless, the SEC has ruled that Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin are not securities, meaning that the assets\u2019 ICOs won\u2019t be reassessed by the regulator, which has been shutting down \u201cunregistered securities\u201d during its sweeping probe.\nThe CFTC, the agency that controls commodity derivatives transactions, claims that tokens are commodities. Basically, in their view, Bitcoin is closer to gold than to conventional currencies or securities, as it is not backed by the government and does not have a liability attached to it.\nThe Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen), the bureau that has full authority for Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) matters, considers tokens to be money. In their view, ICO sales are subject to the money transmitter rules under the Bank Secrecy Act, and are therefore required to register with the government, collect information about their customers, and report any suspicious financial activities.\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in turn, believes that cryptocurrencies are not currencies, but properties, meaning that when cryptocurrencies are sold for a profit, a capital gains tax will be levied.\nHowever, the complex supervisory situation in the U.S. might change in the future. In late December 2018, two congressmen introduced a bipartisan bill titled \u201cToken Taxonomy Act,\u201d aiming to prevent over-regulation in the domestic cryptocurrency space. Specifically, the paper offers more clarity in regard to ICO registration and taxation policy.\nGermany\nStatus of cryptocurrencies: private money\n\nCryptocurrencies are not legal tender in Germany, but they have been recognized as \u201cprivate money\u201d by the German Finance Ministry since 2013. Consequently, any profit made through trading, mining or exchanging Bitcoin or altcoins is subject to a capital gains tax. However, according the German Income Tax Act, if the assets (cryptos) are held for more than one year, they become tax exempt.\nCrypto seems to be relatively popular among young people in Germany. According to a November poll conducted by the German Consumer Centers of Hesse and Saxony, more than a quarter of Germans aged 18 to 29 are interested in buying digital assets.\nMeanwhile, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) has been maintaining a rather aggressive stance toward ICOs, reporting on unauthorized offerings and warning private investors to \u201ckeep away from such things.\u201d The agency has also called for international regulations in the sector.\nSwitzerland\nStatus of cryptocurrencies: properties\n\nHome to the famous Crypto Valley located in Zug, Switzerland is renowned for its friendly approach toward crypto-related technologies. Just recently, major global Bitcoin wallet Xapo announced it will relocate key business operations from Hong Kong to Switzerland, citing \u201copaque jurisdiction.\u201d\nIn Switzerland, cryptocurrencies constitute properties. According to a 2014 report issued by Federal Council, the Swiss government classifies cryptocurrency as \u201cvirtual currencies,\u201d or, more specifically, as \"digital representation of a value which can be traded on the Internet but not accepted as legal tender anywhere.\u201d\nSouth Korea\nStatus of cryptocurrencies: not defined yet\n\nSouth Korea has been spearheading the crypto industry since the 2017 investor boom. Specifically, in July 2017, the local exchange market was processing over 14 percent of global Bitcoin trades, being the third-largest market after the U.S. and Japan. Soon, the South Korean crypto industry was hit with a Chinese-like blanket ban on ICOs, performed by the local financial regulator, which was lifted later in May 2018. Meanwhile, the country has been advancing on the fintech field, steadily becoming an international blockchain hub.\nWhile there\u2019s been a lot regulatory uncertainty along the way, it might not be the case in the near future. In late December, as many as six bills to regulate the crypto industry were introduced by local lawmakers. Specifically, the proposed legislation aims to establish more protection for private investors and deal with the lack of \u201cdefinition for virtual currencies and regulations for virtual currency transactions in the current law,\u201d among other things.\nMalta\nStatus of cryptocurrencies: digital medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value\n\nMalta is famously called the blockchain island, where several foreign cryptocurrency exchanges, including OKex, Binance and BitBay have set up their operations due to the development of a crypto-friendly space.\nIn July 2018, the local parliament approved and enacted three bills on distributed ledger technology (DLT): the Digital Innovation Authority Act, the Innovative Technological Arrangement and Services Act and the Virtual Financial Asset Act.\nAnnouncing the changes on Twitter, Silvio Schembri, the junior minister for financial services, digital economy and innovation within the Office of the Prime Minister of Malta, claimed that the country became \u201cthe first world jurisdiction to provide legal certainty to this space.\u201d\nAs per the Virtual Financial Asset Act, cryptocurrencies are officially referred to as virtual financial assets (VFA), possibly to avoid the stigma that might be attached to the word \u201ccryptocurrencies\u201d: For instance, ICOs have been named initial VFA offerings, while crypto exchanges have become VFA exchanges.\nMore specifically, VFA stands for \"any form of digital medium recordation that is used as a digital medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value,\" which is, however, \"not electronic money, a financial instrument, or a virtual token.\" The use of virtual tokens is allowed only on \u201cthe DLT platform on which it was issued,\u201d while the redemption for funds is available only \u201con such platform directly by the issuer of such DLT asset.\u201d\nMalaysia\nStatus of cryptocurrencies: securities\n\nRecently, Malaysia became one of the latest countries to roll out regulatory policy in regard to crypto. Starting from Jan. 15, cryptocurrencies are now classified as securities there, which means they are under the purview of the Malaysian Securities Commission. Crypto exchanges or ICOs that continue to operate without the watchdog\u2019s approval could face a 10-year jail sentence and up to $2.4 million in fines.\nNevertheless, the changes came in with a silver lining: According to Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng, the Malaysian government sees the potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain to boost the domestic economy:\n\u201cThe Ministry of Finance views digital assets, as well as its underlying blockchain technologies, as having the potential to bring about innovation in both old and new industries. In particular, we believe digital assets have a role to play as an alternative fundraising avenue for entrepreneurs and new businesses, and an alternate asset class for investors.\u201d\nSingapore\nStatus of cryptocurrencies: not legal tender, unregulated\n\nSingapore is a booming market for crypto: Close to the end of 2018, both South Korea\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Upbit, and major Chinese player Binance announced their expansion into the local market.\nMeanwhile, in November, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) broadened the existing regulatory regime to bring certain cryptocurrencies under its jurisdiction. Thus, the central bank introduced a mandatory licensing regime for payment service providers, which are now required to apply for one of three licenses based on the nature and scale of their crypto activities.\nPreviously, however, the MAS stressed that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in Singapore, and that the agency does not regulate them.", "birthday": "2019-01-26T22:50:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-26 22:50:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 26}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bis-report-questions-longevity-efficacy-of-proof-of-work-based-cryptocurrencies", "title": " BIS Report Questions Longevity, Efficacy of Proof-of-Work Based Cryptocurrencies ", "content": "A recent report from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has cast a spotlight on the efficacy and longevity of the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus and the future of Bitcoin.\nThe paper takes an in-depth look at how the Bitcoin protocol verifies payments using blockchain technology and various consensus algorithms.\nPoW algorithms are a major point of discussion, with the author suggesting two major drawbacks. Firstly, the high cost of ensuring payment finality in a reasonable time frame, and the belief that PoW systems won\u2019t produce adequate transaction fees to guarantee payment security in the long run.\nIt is a controversial and thought-provoking narrative, as it calls into question the future viability of Bitcoin as a transaction system and how it achieves payment finality through PoW.\nUnpacking the report\nThe 31-page document goes into some technical detail, unpacking the nitty gritty aspects of the Bitcoin protocol, and how payments are validated and recorded on the blockchain.\nWith a big focus on the economics of Bitcoin, the author examines how Bitcoin creates an immutable record of payments via PoW and goes into great depth examining data tied to transaction fees and block rewards, as well as the future potential of this method.\nIn essence, the author suggests that a 51 percent attack by malicious miners is inherently profitable, using assumptions based on various economic considerations of Bitcoin mining.\nThe author notes that a successful attacker would gain double-spent coins, by transaction fees and block rewards:\n\u201cThis makes an attack inherently more profitable than honest mining, unless there are strong disadvantages in terms of costs for short-term rentals, a price collapse following any double-spending, or deterrence through overarching coordination.\u201d\nThe second major argument of the research paper is solely focused on mining income. The premise of this section is that mining income from fees is not adequate enough for miners to keep their equipment operational in the future.\nExamining the way in which transaction fees fluctuate during different periods of time, it is suggested that the transaction market cannot produce enough income for miners to remain profitable.\nThis is due to the way in which transaction fees work in the Bitcoin protocol. Users can assign the transaction fee of any given payment on the network, and miners naturally look to include transactions with the highests fees in their mined block to maximize their earnings.\nNevertheless, some transactions are seen to be \u201cfree-riding,\u201d as they may carry a small transaction fee but are bundled into a block \u2014 therefore not contributing to a positive economic environment for miners.\nThis is shown by the difference of transaction fees during periods of low and high transaction volumes.\nConsidering this, it is argued that miners have relied heavily on the value of Bitcoin block rewards, which are garnered by successfully mining a block and recording transactions \u2014 as examined below.\nSo, with these two considerations, the report predicts that liquidity is set to drop in the coming years, as there is less incentive for miners to actively maintain the Bitcoin blockchain. This could potentially lead to massive delays in payments being processed and confirmed.\nThe paper then goes on to explore various options that could address these concerns. Second-layer solutions like the Lightning Network are identified as potential answers to these problems.\nNevertheless, the paper essentially argues that Bitcoin needs to depart from the PoW consensus and adopt some sort of \u201csocial coordination or institutionalisation.\u201d\nHow realistic are these assumptions?\nWhile this research paper provides some interesting food for thought, some of its assumptions are based on a reality that will be realized only after a century from now.\nPart of the writer\u2019s argument assumes that once Bitcoin miners can no longer earn BTC rewards for unlocking a block, they won\u2019t be able to make enough income on transaction fees alone.\nIn short, the Bitcoin mining process is what ensures that transactions are validated and recorded on the ever-expanding blockchain. Computers, known as miners, are required to solve a cryptographic algorithm in order to unlock a block, which is then used to store transactions.\nThe reward for doing this work comes in the form of transactions fees and a certain amount of Bitcoin, which is awarded to the miner who unlocks a block.\nBitcoin uses a PoW algorithm known as SHA-256, and it requires both time and electricity to solve. The system is programmed to become more difficult to solve as the mining pool grows.\nThe Bitcoin reward for mining a block also halves every 210,000 blocks and, as it stands, miners receive a 12.5 BTC reward for unlocking a new block. The next halving is predicted to occur in May 2020.\nAs Cointelegraph has previously reported, given that there are no changes to the protocol, the Bitcoin cap of 21 million tokens will be reached by the year 2140, 121 years from now.\nThus, the argument put forward by the author that Bitcoin payments would take months once the block rewards hit zero holds no real relevance for the next 100 years, at least. However, as mentioned in the report, the development of the Lightning Network could very well answer the scaling and speed issues of transaction validation.\nCrypto industry investor Anthony Pompliano wasn\u2019t convinced that the BIS report paints an accurate prediction of how the mining ecosystem and Bitcoin could change:\n\u201cThe more FUD that is published by legacy financial institutions, the more bullish I become. Bitcoin definitely has risks and challenges ahead, but this report does not give an accurate representation of them.\u201d\nWhile he may not agree with the outcomes given, Pompliano believes that the Lightning Network could well be the second-layer application that answers some of Bitcoin\u2019s teething problems:\n\u201cThe Lightning Network growth and adoption has been incredible. It is probably one of the fastest-growing products in crypto, which leads me to believe it has an increased probability of being the scaling solution of the future.\u201d\nA harsh truth\nWhile the paper hints at the possible shortcomings of Bitcoin, the preeminent cryptocurrency has proven itself through many trials over the last 10 years.", "birthday": "2019-01-27T13:40:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-27 13:40:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 27}

The group\u2019s target was Nordic IT company Advania, to which all seven defendants will now pay compensation of 33 million Icelandic Krona (about $273,000).\nSuspect Arrested in 11 Million IOTA Theft Case After International Police Collaboration\nA 36-year-old individual suspected of the theft of over $11 million in IOTA, as well as fraud and money laundering, has been arrested by the United Kingdom\u2019s South East Regional Organised Crime Unit. The Hessen State Police in Germany, the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency and Europol also helped with the arrest, following a search warrant carried out in Oxford, U.K. The suspect has reportedly stolen more than $11 million in IOTA from over 85 victims since January 2018 by using a malicious IOTA seed generator to lead users to private keys that he controls.", "birthday": "2019-01-27T15:57:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-27 15:57:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 27}
{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-crypto-performers-overview-tron-litecoin-binance-coin-dash-monero", "title": " Top 5 Crypto Performers Overview: Tron, Litecoin, Binance Coin, Dash, Monero ", "content": "The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nJeff Schumacher, founder of BCG Digital Ventures, told CNBC during a panel discussion in Davos, Switzerland that Bitcoin will go to zero. In another interview with Fox Business, Fundstrat Global Managing Partner Thomas Lee said that Bitcoin can still go to $25,000, which he calls its fair value.\nAnalysts at JPMorgan Chase have predicted that Bitcoin is likely to plunge to $2,400 and eventually further to $1,260. Such differing opinions can confuse new investors who are looking to enter the crypto markets.\nWe believe that traders should focus on the fundamental developments in the crypto space, as well as on the price action on the charts. Cryptocurrencies as an asset class are here to stay.\nNumerous blockchain projects are securing funding from traditional investors every month, which confirms that those investors are confident in the long-term promise of crypto. Crypto companies are introducing new products to attract institutional investors.\nMoreover, efforts are in progress to integrate cryptocurrencies into the mainstream economy. It is only a matter of time before the bear market ends and a new bull phase begins.\nHowever, this time, we don\u2019t expect a vertical rise as seen in 2017. It will likely be a more gradual movement higher. A few of the top cryptocurrencies are showing signs of bottoming out. Let\u2019s see if any of the top performers of this week qualify as a buy.\nTRX/USD\nTron (TRX) was the best performing cryptocurrency among the largest coins by market cap over the past week. In its weekly report, Tron said that it has over \u201c150 DApps and more than 300 smart contracts.\u201d\nAt the recent niTron Summit, Tron founder and CEO Justin Sun said that he expects the number of decentralized applications (DApps) on the network to surge to 2,000 by the year-end.\n\nThe TRX/USD pair is showing strength as the bulls are attempting to sustain above the overhead resistance at $0.02815521. As the cryptocurrency has been stuck in this range since mid-August, we believe that a breakout will result in a new uptrend.\nThe immediate target objective is $0.4, but we expect this to be crossed and the rally to extend to $0.05218328. Therefore, we suggest long positions on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.02815521, with a stop loss just below $0.021.\nConversely, if the cryptocurrency fails to sustain the breakout and drops below $0.02815521 once again, it will remain range bound between $0.0183 and $0.02815521. The sentiment will weaken if the bears push the price below the support of $0.0183.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) has come up with a new tagline \u201cTake control of your money and pay with Litecoin\u201d and a new logo. The logo was first showcased during a UFC event sponsored by the company and was widely appreciated. Will the new vision help change the fortunes for the struggling cryptocurrency? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe LTC/USD pair is attempting to put a bottom in place. After the initial pullback from the low of $23.090, the bulls have held the support at $29.349 for the past five weeks. This increases the probability of this level being a higher low. We will get a confirmation if the price breaks out of the downtrend line and the previous swing high of $40.784.\nLong-term investors can expect the cryptocurrency to start a new uptrend if the price sustains above $40.784. There is a minor resistance at $47.246, above which the move can extend to $65.561.\nOur bullish view will be invalidated if the bears defend the overhead resistance of the downtrend line, or the $40.784 mark. In such a case, the price will remain range bound between $29.349 and $40.784 for a few more weeks, before breaking out or breaking down from it.\nBNB/USD\nBinance Coin (BNB) has made giant strides in the past few weeks and is now ranking 12th largest coin by market capitalization. Binance has become the latest exchange to offer a crypto-to-crypto over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk to benefit from the surge in OTC trading.\nThe company has rebranded its Trust Wallet as a multi cryptocurrency wallet, adding support to a larger number of blockchains and has improved its various features. Binance Charity has announced a Lunch for Children program that will help provide lunch to disadvantaged children in developing countries in Africa and elsewhere. Can BNB\u2019s recovery continue or will it falter? Let\u2019s see.\n\nThe BNB/USD pair has reached the resistance line of the descending channel. The 20-week EMA is also placed just above the channel. Therefore, we anticipate a strong resistance in the zone of $7.17\u2013$7.7.\nA breakout and close (UTC time frame) above this zone is likely to signal a trend reversal. The upside target is $12 and if that is crossed, the move can extend to $15. We retain the buy proposed in the previous weekly analysis.\nIf the position gets filled, we suggest traders book partial profits at resistance levels and raise the stops on the remaining amount. After all, the sentiment of the broader crypto market is still negative, so it is better to pocket small profits while one can, instead of waiting for a home run.\nOur bullish assumption will be invalidated if the price reverses direction from the current levels. The downtrend will resume if the bears sink the coin below $4.1723848. \u00a0\nDASH/USD\nDash recently released version 0.13 of its build, and 47 percent of masternodes have already transitioned to it. The cryptocurrency is already quite popular in Venezuela with over 2,600 merchants accepting it.\nWe expect the latest political crisis in Venezuela to attract more people to Dash, and this will highlight the importance of cryptocurrencies during times of unrest and crisis. Anypay and eGifter have partnered with coin, allowing customers to turn their DASH into eGift cards without converting to fiat. Can these fundamental factors propel the price? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe long-term trend in the DASH/USD pair is still down. The bulls are attempting to form a higher low around $67. However, both moving averages are trending down, and the RSI is also close to the oversold levels. This shows that the sellers currently have the upper hand. If the bears sink the cryptocurrency below $56.214, the downtrend will resume.\nThe pair will show signs of strength if it breaks out of the overhead resistance zone of $103\u2013$123. If that happens, a rally to $175 and above it to $224 will be probable. Another possibility is that the bears defend the immediate resistance at $103.261, resulting in a consolidation.", "birthday": "2019-01-27T16:26:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-27 16:26:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 27}

", "content": "Amid a seemingly constant stream of new concepts claiming to be key to crypto to breaking through to the financial mainstream, one immovable issue remains ever-present: scalability. The crypto community is abuzz with new projects relating to the issue, from the Bitcoin (BTC) Lightning Network to a brand new cryptocurrency designed by some of the top names in crypto and American academia. Cointelegraph takes a look at the latest scalability developments and what they can bring to blockchain and crypto.\nSome of the United States\u2019 finest academic and technological have\u00a0come together in a new project aiming to launch a globally scalable decentralized payment network, according to a press release published on Jan.17.\nThe brainchild of this group of tech professionals and leading American academics is called \u201cUnit-e,\u201d a new cryptocurrency that aims to end the scalability issues plaguing both blockchain and cryptocurrencies alike. Unit-e is receiving funding from Distributed Technologies Research (DTR), a nonprofit organization based in Zug, the central nexus of Switzerland\u2019s so-called Crypto Valley. In addition to the newly launched DTR, Unit-e has also received an injection of funds from San Francisco-based Pantera Capital.\nAs per the press release, the core members of the team involved in developing Unit-e are based in Berlin, with the team largely consisting of \u201copen-source and distributed systems engineers.\u201d\nDTR Foundation Council Member and Co-Chief Investment Officer at Pantera Capital Joey Krug acknowledged that, although the current technology represents a stumbling block for the adoption of cryptocurrencies on a wider scale, Unit-e is aware of this and is incorporating that knowledge into its research:\n\u201cA lack of scalability is holding back cryptocurrency adoption. The Unit-e developers are turning this research into real scalable performance that will benefit a huge swath of decentralized financial applications.\u201d\nGiulia Fanti, one of DTR\u2019s lead researchers and assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, explained to Cointelegraph why scalability is important and what this project is doing to tackle it:\n\u201cScalability is difficult to tackle in part because there are so many moving parts in blockchain systems. The ideal design should have low storage, computation, and communication costs, all while guaranteeing security and decentralization. Any of these requirements alone can be challenging to optimize, and the combination of these requirements is legitimately a very difficult problem.\u201cI think two key factors make our project interesting: The first is that we are doing research at all levels of the stack, ranging from the network to consensus to economics, instead of focusing on just one area. This is important because the subsystems of blockchains are very interconnected. The second factor is that we didn't limit ourselves to people who already work on blockchains. Instead, we brought in experts from areas that are critical to blockchains \u2013 e.g., networking, economics, information theory, distributed systems \u2013 and asked them to approach these problems using the expertise of their respective fields.\"\n\nPramod Viswanath, a researcher for DTR and professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign also spoke to Cointelegraph about how scalability has been an issue in the early stages of any technology:\n\u201cGlobal scalability is usually quite hard for any technology. As an example, consider cellular wireless systems. Every man, woman and child on Earth has one now. But wireless technology itself is not new at all. Marconi demonstrated a wireless communication link across the Atlantic Ocean in 1901 and it took 100+ years for the technology to really scale globally. It took huge innovations beyond Marconi's technology for wireless to scale globally. A big part of this innovation was system or full stack design, redesigning all aspects of the radio stacks.\u201cBitcoin is the equivalent of Marconi's historic wireless transmission: Bitcoin demonstrated that secure distributed trust is possible. But it came at the cost of poor performance (throughput, latency). We are redesigning the full stack of cryptocurrencies in our quest at the getting global scalability.\u201d\nDuring the interview, Viswanath said that he was aware of the tendency for projects that claim that they are a one-trick fix for the many issues bogging down the crypto and blockchain sectors. As a result, Viswanath stated that their project was kept quiet until solid research could be presented, in the hope that scientific output could form the basis of Unit-e as opposed to mere fantasy:\n\u201cWe are aware of the noise in the crypto community. This is why we took a very conservative approach. We have been in stealth mode for over a year, coming out in the open only when we found that we have already demonstrated a large bit of the claims/promises that Unit-e is making. Indeed, the standard \u2018white paper\u2019 in crypto projects is replaced in our case by a \u2018150+ page research manifesto,\u2019 which itself is a succinct summary of 10+ research papers by us in the past year, each written for a scientific audience in the appropriate level of engineering and mathematical formalization. These scientific outputs are really the basis behind the claims of Unit-e, not so much as wishful thinking.\u201c\nIn spite of the myriad challenges the hitherto insurmountable issue of scalability has presented, Fanti is optimistic about the progress being made and believes that developers shouldn\u2019t shy away from experimentation in their research:\n\u201cI think scalability is a very important issue to solve if cryptocurrencies and blockchains more generally are going to gain (or even keep) traction. We're now at the point where there is demand for these technologies, but the growing pains are starting to be evident. So it's critical to explore scalability solutions. At the same time, it can be difficult to experiment with drastically new scalability solutions in already-existing systems due to technical and political inertia. Because of this, we felt there were some clear benefits to building a standalone system with the flexibility to try out different ideas. The hope is that these ideas can eventually benefit the whole community.\u201d\n\nBabak Dastmaltschi, chairman of the DTR Foundation Council is bullish on blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Much like Viswanath, Dastmaltschi expressed his belief that this transitional era for cryptocurrency is not unlike the birth of the telecommunications industry and the dawn of the internet:\n\"The blockchain and digital currency markets are at an interesting crossroads, reminiscent of the inflection points reached when industries such as telecom and the internet were coming of age. These are transformative times. We are nearing the point where every person in the world is connected together. Advancements in distributed technologies will enable open networks, avoiding the need for centralized authorities. DTR was formed with the goal of enabling and supporting this revolution, and it is in this vein that we unveil Unit-e.\"\nFanti commented that one of the most encouraging things about the blockchain community is the readiness for cooperation among its members. In this way, those working on Unit-e have been able to learn from previous projects attempting to tackle scalability, such as the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Fanti outlined that, although both projects center around the same focal point, there are some key differences between the two:\n\u201cLike the Lightning network, we are very focused on scalability. I think one key difference is that because we are starting from scratch, we have the freedom to completely rethink other parts of the blockchain (e.g., consensus mechanisms) that are difficult to change in more established systems. That being said, some of our research is quite related to scalability of the Lightning network, and payment channel networks in general.\u201cSome scalability challenges in payment channel networks haven't really come to a head yet, in part because adoption is still growing. But once these technologies become more widely used, it will become increasingly important to understand how to route and schedule packets \u2013 much like the internet. We hope that some of the research going on for Unit-e can also benefit the Lightning Network and other projects in the payment channel network space, just as we are learning from their prior work.\u201d\n\nLightning Network\nOn Dec. 23, BTC statistics website Bitcoinvisuals.com announced that the capacity of the Bitcoin Lightning Network surpassed $2 million. Born from a white paper first published in 2015 by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja, the BTC Lightning Network is a second-layer payment protocol that functions on top of the BTC blockchain.\nMuch like Unit-e, the network aims to tackle the scalability issues weighing down the crypto sector. However, as opposed to adapting the mechanics of the blockchain itself, the BTC Lightning Network seeks to increase transaction speed by using payment channels. The results of this approach help speed up transaction speeds between users because transactions are not recorded on the blockchain until the channel closes.\nThe news of the increase in the network\u2019s capacity comes against the backdrop of a dismal period of decreasing crypto prices, famously dubbed the \u201ccrypto winter.\u201d In spite of the vertiginous drops witnessed across the crypto sector throughout the 2018, the network managed to maintain strong growth.\nIn spite of being lauded for its efforts to reduce the transaction time between users, the network has attracted criticism for one major aspect: Although the transactions take place on top of the blockchain, they don\u2019t enjoy the same level of security. As a result, it\u2019s unlikely that the method will result in the transfer of large transactions, as these would need the backup of decentralized security that can be guaranteed only through the original blockchain layer.\nAs of Dec. 23, the capacity of node channels supporting the Lightning scaling protocol was 496.8 BTC, only just falling short of a landmark 500 BTC. December also witnessed an increase in channels connecting nodes, with 14,352 unique channels doing so by late December.\nThe Lightning Network also drew praise from crypto trailblazer Nick Szabo who said that the current state of technical development in the sector would lead to an uptick in second-layer solutions in 2019.\nMajor central bank institution casts doubt on potential of blockchain in current state\nA new report published on Jan. 21 by the Bank for International Settlement (BIS) has found that Bitcoin\u2019s problems are only solvable by moving on from a proof-of-work (PoW) system. BIS is a Swiss-based organization comprised of 60 central banks that reportedly account for 95 percent of global GDP.\nAccording to the report, the nature of the blockchain infrastructure will result in a steady increase in transaction times as a result of only a limited number of new Bitcoin ever being created. This report also found that transaction fees would no longer be able to support mining expenses and that the transaction speeds would be so slow that the network could become virtually unusable:\n\u201cSimple calculations suggest that once block rewards are zero, it could take months before a Bitcoin payment is final, unless new technologies are deployed to speed up payment finality.\u201d\nThe report comments favorably on solutions such as the BTC Lightning Network, stating that \u201cThe only fundamental remedy would be to depart from proof-of-work.\u201d The report adds however, that a departure from the existing system would \u201cprobably require some form of social coordination or institutionalization, and concludes that \u201cin the digital age too, good money is likely to remain a social construct rather than a purely technological one.\u201d\nMIT professor says blockchain must increase scalability\nOn Jan. 21, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor Silvio Micali became the latest U.S.-based academic to outline which major aspects of blockchain systems must be improved in order to maximize all the benefits that the technology entails.\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, Micali stated his view that security, decentralization and scalability are three core aspects of blockchain systems that must function simultaneously in order to deliver an inclusive and borderless economy. With regard to scalability, Micali emphasized that a decentralized system requires a higher level of technology in order to ensure the same degree of participation that centralized systems currently enjoy.\nMicali outlined his optimism about future prospects for the technology once it is optimized to a degree to which the current issues regarding scalability and security can finally be dispelled:\n\u201cOnly a true decentralized system, where the power is really so spread that is going to be essentially practically impossible to attack them all and when you don\u2019t need to trust this or that particular node, is going to bring actually the security we really need and deserve.\u201d\nIn January, MIT Technology Review furthered its bullish stance in claiming that 2019 would be the year that blockchain systems would finally enjoy normalization and wider adoption.\nLiquid sidechain\nIn September, Blocksteam\u2019s Liquid Network sidechain for the Bitcoin blockchain was publicly announced. First discussed in 2015, the project has now been launched with the view of improving liquidity between Bitcoin exchanges and brokers.\nThe blog post from Blockstream states that the Liquid sidechain would allow faster transactions between users as a result of a native Liquid Bitcoin (L-BTC) asset backed by a \u201ctwo-way peg\u201d to Bitcoin, Confidential Transaction Technology and Issued Assets that aim to bring \u201cBitcoin-like features to traditional assets.\u201d The Liquid Network FAQ page explains that the Liquid Network differs from the Lightning Network in that its transactions are not \u201climited in amount of channel capacity.\u201d\n\u201cWall Street\u2019s Bookkeeper\u201d enters test phase of DLT replatforming\nOn Nov. 6, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) announced it had commenced the test phase of its attempt to replatform its Trade Information Warehouse (TIW) using distributed ledger technology (DLT). The project is the fruit of a collaboration between IBM, Axonia and R3. If successful, the project would represent a considerable leap forward in both scalability and the potential scope of major blockchain projects.\nIn light of the historic attempts to overcome scalability issues, the DTCC\u2019s attempt to shift its TIW to the blockchain is especially ambitious due to the fact that it processes 98 percent of derivatives transactions worldwide. Furthermore, the statement adds that the DTCC\u2019s subsidiaries \u201cprocessed securities is valued at more the U.S. $1.61 quadrillion.\u201d As per the release, the DTCC\u2019s Global Trade Repository service processed around 40 million over the counter (OTC) positions weekly, along with 1 billion monthly communications via its licensed trade repositories group.\nIn a 19-week study headed by the DTCC in collaboration with both Accenture and R3, the trio found that DLT is scalable enough to support the high-trade volumes of the U.S. equities market. Findings in the report allegedly show that DLT is able to process an entire trading day\u2019s volume at peak rates, amounting to 115,000,000 daily trades, which equates to roughly 6,300 trades per second for five hours on end.", "birthday": "2019-01-24T21:50:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-24 21:50:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 24}

The motivation for the startup came after the company\u2019s founders discovered the extent and impact of oversupply via the National Health Service (NHS) and private health care providers.\nA lack of data sharing means patients can make multiple prescription orders across several websites in a matter of minutes \u2014 an issue of concern for regulators given the growing levels of drug dependency and addiction in the U.K. MediConnect says that, when it comes to opioid painkillers, patients could end up in possession of potentially lethal quantities of the drug in a short space of time, and a lack of control mechanisms means that all of this could take place daily, without a coordinated duty of care.\nInitially, the company\u2019s platform is going to be used by two established online pharmacies that already have a combined user base of 300,000 people, with an average of 30,000 to 50,000 prescriptions currently handled per month. MediConnect hopes that its solution can improve patient outcomes, prevent drug misuse, establish where medicines have come from, and ensure that product recalls can happen more efficiently.\nSadly, the issue of counterfeit drugs is far from a hypothetical one.

Elipay users can kick off their day with an indulgent piece of cake at a premium hotel, challenge themselves in escape rooms, indulge in retail therapy, sip a cocktail at a trendy bar and enjoy high-end cuisine without ever resorting to fiat.\nCheck out\u00a0ELIPAY here\nAll of these venues can be found in the tiny Central European country of Slovenia, which is quickly becoming a hub for crypto, as it pursues the title of \u201cEurope\u2019s Silicon Valley.\u201d Eligma claims that the nation boasts one of the world\u2019s highest concentrations of crypto-friendly locations per capita \u2014 with Slovenia\u2019s capital, Ljubljana, hitting global headlines\u00a0with the launch of \u201cBitcoin City,\u201d a collaboration between Eligma and the BTC City shopping and business center, one of the biggest in Europe.", "birthday": "2019-01-25T13:14:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-25 13:14:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 25}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nAdena Friedman, president and CEO of Nasdaq Inc., believes that cryptocurrencies will have an important role to play in the future, if they can integrate into the economy and find greater practical utility. Clarity on regulations and governance can provide the necessary boost to the nascent asset class.\nOne country that could be at the forefront of retail adoption of cryptocurrencies is Japan. Currently, most transactions in Japan involve paper bills and metal coins, however, the nation is attempting a shift towards a cashless society.\nThe top banks in Japan are working on the development of blockchain-based payment networks that can be operational in time for the Summer Olympics in Tokyo by 2020. If successful, the third largest economy of the world could bring about a change that will force other economies around the world to take notice.\nSeveral smaller countries are also trying to gain leadership in this space. Georgia has migrated most of its land registry to blockchain and the tax system might soon follow.\nThe country also subsidizes local crypto companies via various means, such as discounted electricity rates, tax-free zones and land at nominal prices. Georgia hopes to beat the other crypto-friendly nations like Malta and Bermuda and become an international leader in crypto.\nWhile the fundamental factors are improving by the day, the price is not following suit. However, a Bloomberg analyst expects Bitcoin (BTC) to rally in the short term, based on a study of technical indicators. What does our study forecast? Let\u2019s find out.\nBTC/USD\nThe volatility in Bitcoin (BTC) has shrunk over the past few days. This period of low volatility will eventually lead to a range expansion. The longer the time spent in a tight range, the stronger will be the breakout or breakdown from it.\n\nIt is difficult to predict the direction of the break. During the previous period of low volatility from mid-September to mid-November 2018, the attempt to break out on Oct. 15 failed. After that, the BTC/USD pair broke down on Nov. 14, resulting in a quick drop from $6,480.54 to $3,620.26 within a short span of time.\nThe important resistance to watch on the upside is the downtrend line, and above it the $4,255 mark. A break out of these levels will signal a probable trend reversal.\nOn the other hand, a breakdown of $3,236.09 will resume the downtrend. The next support on the downside is the psychological level of $3,000. We shall wait for an upside range expansion before recommending a long position.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) bounced from the area of $0.30550 on Jan. 22. This shows demand at lower levels. However, the failure of the bulls to break above the downtrend line and the moving averages means that buying dries up at higher levels. The down-sloping moving averages and the RSI below the 50 level suggest that supply exceeds demand.\n\nThe balance might tilt in favor of the bulls if the XRP/USD pair sustains above the moving averages. That would increase the possibility of a rally to $0.4. Based on that, we suggest long positions on a close above $0.336, with a stop loss of $0.305.\nConversely, if the price turns down from the downtrend line and breaks below $0.305, a drop to $0.27795 will be likely.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) dipped below the support of $116.3 again on Jan. 22, but the bears could not capitalize on the breakdown. They could not force the price to the next lower support of $100. This shows that there is buying at lower levels.\n\nNow, if the ETH/USD pair breaks out of the moving averages and scales above $134.5, it will indicate strength. If the price doesn\u2019t drop below $116.3 again within the next couple of days, we might suggest long positions with an allocation of about 30 percent of the usual size. The remaining positions can be added once the price is above $134.5.\nOn the other hand, if the cryptocurrency fails to rise above the moving averages, the bears will again attempt to break the support at $116.3 on a closing (UTC time frame) basis.\nBCH/USD\nThe bulls haven\u2019t been able to push Bitcoin Cash (BCH) above $141 since breaking down of it on Jan. 10. On the downside, $121 has been acting as a strong support. Though the bears had broken below this level during intraday trading, they haven\u2019t been able to close (UTC time frame) below this support in the past few days.\n\nWe expect the bulls to attempt to break above $141. If they are successful, the BCH/USD pair can rise to $177.3, and above it to $239. We might suggest a long position above $141. Until then, we remain neutral on the coin.\nIf the bears defend $141, the cryptocurrency will remain stuck in the tight range of $120\u2013$141.\nEOS/USD\nEOS bounced off the support at $2.3093 on Jan. 22, but the bulls haven\u2019t been able to push the price above $2.5840.\n\nIf the price breaks out of $2.5840, the EOS/USD pair can rally to the next overhead resistance at $3.2081. We might suggest a long position if the price sustains above $2.5840.\nHowever, if the bulls fail to scale $2.5840, the cryptocurrency might extend its stay in the tight range of $2.3093\u2013$2.5840. A breakdown of $2.1733 will open the door for a decline to $1.7746, and below it to $1.55. We couldn\u2019t find a tradeable setup at the current level.\nXLM/USD\nStellar (XLM) has gradually declined close to the yearly low of $0.09285498. Both moving averages are sloping down, and the RSI is in the negative territory, which shows that the sellers are in command.\n\nIf the bears sink the price to new yearly lows, the downtrend will resume. However, if the bulls defend the support at $0.09285498, the XLM/USD pair might bounce to the downtrend line. A break out of this overhead resistance can result in a consolidation between $0.09285498 and $0.13427050.\nAs the short-term trend is down, we shall wait for a trend reversal before recommending a trade.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) has been trading between $29.349 and $33 since Jan. 12. Both moving averages are flat, and the RSI is close to 50 levels. This suggests a balance between the buyers and the sellers.\n\nThe next directional move will start on a breakout or breakdown of this tight range. A breakdown could result in a drop to $27.701, and below it to $23.090.\nOn the other hand, a breakout can carry the LTC/USD pair to $36.428 and above it to $40.784. Therefore, we suggest traders protect their long positions with a stop loss of $27.5.\nTRX/USD\nThough Tron (TRX) has been consolidating inside the range of $0.0183\u2013$0.02815521; the uptrending moving averages point to a probable break out of this range.\n\nIf the TRX/USD pair breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above $0.02815521, it can rally to $0.03801042, and after that to $0.04. Therefore, we suggest long positions on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.02815521, with a stop loss at $0.023.\nConversely, if the bulls fail to scale above $0.02815521, the cryptocurrency will continue to trade inside the range. In such a situation, we shall wait for the price to correct to $0.0183 before suggesting a trade.\nBSV/USD\nThough Bitcoin SV (BSV) slipped below $74.022 during intraday trading on Jan. 19 and Jan. 22, the close (UTC time frame) was above that level. We believe a close (UTC time frame) below $72 can plunge the pair to $65.031, and beyond that to $57.\n", "birthday": "2019-01-23T23:26:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-23 23:26:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 23}

Although the move to \u201cdeplatform\u201d those seen to be allegedly promoting hate speech has received popular support, several high-profile political commentators and libertarian media personalities consider this to constitute and unacceptable assault on free speech.\nAs a result, some of the online crowdfunding platform Patreon\u2019s top content creators decided to leave the platform in favor of Bitcoin funding, each taking with them tens of thousands of dollars in monthly revenue. As the furore surrounding payment platforms and their decision to cancel controversial accounts continues, Cointelegraph takes a closer look at what role crypto plays in what is being portrayed as the latest battleground for the freedom of speech.\nRubin deletes Patreon\nOn Jan. 16, American political commentator Dave Rubin became the latest high-profile public figure to delete his account with the online crowdfunding platform Patreon. Rubin appeared in a live video on his YouTube channel in which he reiterated his prior support for controversial online polemicist Carl Benjamin, also known as Sargon of Akkad, stating that his account cancelation was one of the most important factors in his decision to move from Patreon to Bitcoin funding:\n\u201cThe fact that this has even been going down on Patreon related to freedom of speech, it was because of them kicking off Carl Benjamin, Sargon of Akkad, who has been in this very studio. It seems so fitting that we\u2019re going to finally do this.\u201cWhen I started talking about it everyone said you\u2019ve got to talk to Carl Benjamin, you\u2019ve got to talk to Sargon of Akkad. It seems sort of fitting that the first guy I talked to online about this is the one who got booted, who\u2019s now caused me to leave this. And we\u2019re taking control of our destiny and all that good stuff.\u201d\nAlthough Rubin initially found fame as a stand up comedian, he has become more widely known as an advocate for libertarian values such as freedom of speech. In spite of his claims to earn \u201cbetween 60-70 percent\u201d of his income through Patreon, Rubin said that his decision to switch to Bitcoin constituted \u201ca stand against the ever-moving encroachment on free speech, on free expression\u201d that he perceives to be taking place across mainstream funding platforms.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a normal businessman would say can I just get rid of 70 percent of my company\u2019s revenue and we\u2019ll see what happens. I just feel like it [Benjamin\u2019s banning] was just enough.\u201d\nRubin further commented on what he considers to be an orchestrated affront on liberty and a campaign of enforced censorship being carried out by tech companies:\n\u201cThis seems like the next obvious step in everything that\u2019s been going on here. I just think that at some point, us, the people, have to push back against these tech companies. You can\u2019t keep on infringing on the freedom of expression. Yes, they can do whatever they want at private companies and there\u2019s some issue as to whether these platforms are becoming the true public space of the future and what\u2019s the relationship between that entity and a platform that we can all communicate on and the government.\u201d\nRubin\u2019s video also contained the announcement that he plans to launch his own funding platform with fellow online commentator and clinical psychologist Dr. Jordan B. Peterson:\n\u201cAlso, the key to this whole thing is that Jordan and I are also working on a new platform. There\u2019s a limit to the amount that I can tell you, for legal reasons. I can\u2019t give away all the secrets and the keys to the kingdom just yet. We\u2019re working on another platform. There are huge, huge questions in relation to how we want this platform to function. Should it be monetized through crypto, should we be doing torrent video streaming, how can it be fully protected so that we don\u2019t have to worry about payment processors, so we don\u2019t have to worry about tech companies taking us down? As crazy as that is, all I\u2019m doing here is exercising free speech. I like interviewing people, I enjoy having good conversation and all these things. Jordan and I are working on that, there\u2019s a company formed. We\u2019re working on that. Today is step one. Step one for me is get off Patreon and let's move everybody.\u201d\nPeterson was also among the group of content creators that vowed to leave Patreon on the grounds of free speech. In spite of reportedly earning $80,000 per month through the platform, Peterson also recently deleted his Patreon account. \u00a0\nRubin first announced his intention to switch to Bitcoin in early January. Members of the crypto community responded enthusiastically to Rubin\u2019s announcement and were quick to respond with practical advice for the transition. At time of publication, Rubin\u2019s Bitcoin wallet has received a total of \u00a00.8119261 BTC.\nNo more gifts for Gab\nThe controversial social media platform Gab is one of the most prominent sites to be shut down in the name of monitoring hate speech. In January, the company\u2019s official Twitter account reported that its corporate account with the United States crypto exchange and wallet service provider Coinbase had been terminated. In early January, the merchant and personal accounts of Gab co-founder Andrew Torba were also shut down.\nAs predicted: the on ramps and off ramps (exchanges) are going to start censoring not only companies, but also individuals. @coinbase has now banned both Gab's merchant account and Andrew Torba's personal account.Decentralized exchanges are the future. pic.twitter.com/LXkjblrdgu\u2014 Gab.com (@getongab) January 4, 2019\n\nGab describes itself on its website as a \u201csocial network that champions free speech, individual liberty and the free flow of information online. All are welcome.\u201d However, the social network quickly earned itself a more sinister reputation as an echo chamber for alt- and far-right views. Gab faced intense public scrutiny after it was revealed that Robert Gregory Bowers, the perpetrator of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, had reportedly laid bare his intentions to harm people via posts on the social media network prior to the crime.\nFollowing this, mainstream funding platforms such as PayPal and Stripe terminated their relationship with the company. Bitpay, a payment processor that uses cryptocurrency, also decided that hosting the organization presented a high level of risk and would consequently no longer be able to provide their services.\nThe company\u2019s latest attempt to find a platform through which to receive funding also ended in failure. On Jan. 6, Gab\u2019s official Twitter handle tweeted that their account with Square\u2019s Cash App had been blocked, along with the personal account of Andrew Torba. After a delay of about 20 minutes, the company published another tweet.\nYes, we know who owns Square. We realize our accounts have been blocked for unknown reasons.Cash App is still the easiest and fastest way to buy bitcoin on a mobile device. That\u2019s still a net positive for bitcoin and freedom in our book.They can\u2019t ban everyone.\u2014 Gab.com (@getongab) January 8, 2019\n\nMedia sources emphasized the role of Gab\u2019s reputation in its lack of success in establishing a long-term relationship with a payments processor.\nThroughout January, the company has taken to Twitter in a bid to assure viewers that its core values were in line with their own, presenting Bitcoin as a way of bringing about \u201cfreedom from central banks, financial censorship, and a rigged financial system.\u201d\nIn recent weeks, the organization has repeatedly said that support for Bitcoin is one of the company\u2019s three pillars \u2014 \u201cmaximalism\u201d concerning free speech, Bitcoin and freedom, again hammering home a new style of self-promotion in an effort to distance itself from the proliferation of hate speech that brought it to the limelight:\n\u201cUnapologetic free speech maximalist. Unapologetic bitcoin maximalist. Unapologetic freedom maximalist. But I repeat myself.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s search for a funding platform continues and stated on its website that it is \u201cthe most censored, smeared, and no-platformed startup in history.\u201d\nAs mainstream platforms close their doors, crypto alternatives fill the gaps in the market\nCompanies and individuals alike have been quick to distance themselves from the controversial social media site. However, on Jan. 5, the Bisq network appeared to promote its services in the wake of the account terminations:\n\u201cIf Bitcoin allows you to \u201cbe your own bank,\u201d Bisq allows you to \u201cbe your own exchange.\u201d YOU run Bisq on YOUR own machine and trade Bitcoin P2P. Censorship-resistance by design, not policy. Gatekeepers have no business being in bitcoin. Let\u2019s shun them!\u201d\nSteve Jain, a contributor to the Bisq project who focuses on communications, spoke to Cointelegraph about Gab\u2019s banning and the move to crypto funding:\n\u201cI don't follow Gab too closely, and I don't use their service, but they're very good at marketing so I usually end up seeing their headlines or tweets anyway. And I recall seeing headlines throughout the past several months about them being banned from the most major payment processors. So I don't think they were left with a choice \u2014 Bitcoin cannot ban you. It's a natural move for them.\u201d\nJain also mentioned that the concern about payment platform censorship is not contained to those associated with the far-right alone, explaining that crypto is principally democratic in its design:\n\u201cSignificant damage is already done. Many people (especially those who tend to stray away from mainstream politics) have known for a while that something strange was happening on the major platforms, but most such accounts were anecdotal. These recent developments are concrete realizations of many people\u2019s suspicions that the big companies don't necessarily operate with consistent principles. It's not that Bitcoin won't ban you because it's so nice and principled \u2014 it can't. This immutable finality is part of what Bitcoin brings to the table that no other human-managed service can ever possibly bring.\u201d\nWhen asked whether Bisq is looking to capitalize on disgruntled Patreon users by retweeting Gab\u2019s account termination notice, Jain was quick to emphasize that Bisq is \u201cmore of a platform for people to exchange Bitcoin for national currencies, so there isn't much of a way for it to directly provide help to disgruntled Patreon users.\u201d However, Jain did not rule out the possibility of ex-Patreon service users including Bisq in their future plans to build a more democratic payment platform:\n\u201cI have, however, heard of some people looking to start Patreon alternatives powered by Bisq, where (I guess) Bisq would act as a tool to exchange dollars for Bitcoin that cannot be censored. Recently we've made some great progress on the Bisq API, and I (for one) would love to see Bisq power such services.\u201d\nIn spite of the circumstances in which websites like Gab and individuals such as Sargon of Akkad are turning to cryptocurrency funding because they have no choice, Jain maintains that this does not compromise the core principles of cryptocurrencies themselves:\n\u201cPeer-to-peer trading is merely the digital equivalent of you and I trading Bitcoin for USD in person. You bring the Bitcoin, and I bring the USD. We trade. Face-to-face, peer-to-peer. It doesn't matter who you are, and it doesn't matter who I am. All that matters is that we each hold up our ends of the deal. No BS. If that's not ethical, I don't know what is!\u201cI would argue it's the introduction of third parties that adds all kinds of complications and stipulations and liabilities and ethical considerations.\u201d\nU.K. far-right feels the squeeze as prominent figures are stripped of funding\nThe United Kingdom has also witnessed a number of account terminations connected to the far-right, with banned individuals turning to crypto as a last resort. On Jan. 17, YouTube demonetized the account of U.K.-based far-right extremist Tommy Robinson after alleged breaches of the site\u2019s advertising guidelines. The YouTube clampdown on the founder of the English Defence League, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is the latest in a series of bans for the activist, brought about by pressure put on crowdfunding companies by members of the public.\nRobinson has also faced bans on a number of other platforms, including both Twitter and PayPal. The far-right activist\u2019s PayPal account was terminated in November after the company stated that they \u201cdo not allow PayPal services to be used to promote hate, violence, or other forms of intolerance that is discriminatory.\u201d Robinson\u2019s ban was preceded by an online petition to remove him from the platform that gathered thousands of signatures, drawing attention to his past actions of \u201cstirring up racist violence with online content.\u201d As Robinson\u2019s options for fundraising via traditional platforms are being removed one by one, the activist has turned to crypto in a last-ditch attempt to secure funding for his controversial activities.\nAround the time of his arrest and imprisonment for contempt of court in 2018, Robinson received around 20,000 British pounds (roughly $25,777) in Bitcoin, including a donation of 5,500 pounds (~$7,088) on the day of his detention. The success of Robinson\u2019s online fundraising has sparked a series of copycat activists, all of whom proclaim to be defenders of the freedom of speech and encourage supporters to donate to their cause.\nU.K.-based commentator on far-right politics Mike Stuchbery spoke to Cointelegraph about the tendency for far-right groups to shift to crypto after mainstream funding platforms terminate their accounts:\n\u201cFar Right groups are slowly having their sources of income taken from them as activists target payment processors such as PayPal and Stripe, rather than calling for the banning of groups in their totality. Far Right groups are also finding themselves 'deplatformed' from mainstream social media and video platforms. They are, therefore, either creating their own alternatives to these platforms \u2013 Gab, Minds, Bitchute \u2013 or are looking at other, decentralized alternatives to disseminating their ideas.\u201d\nStuchbery commented that while the arrest and jailing of Tommy Robinson acted as a catalyst for the shift to Bitcoin, the circumstances created a reputational crisis for crypto funding in general:", "birthday": "2019-01-23T12:58:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-23 12:58:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 23}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-africa-is-making-strides-toward-crypto-clarity-with-the-reserve-banks-latest-report", "title": " Report by South Africa's Reserve Bank Makes Strides Toward Crypto Clarity in the Country ", "content": "A working group of South African financial regulatory organizations has released a consultation paper focused on cryptocurrencies, calling for public input to develop a cryptocurrency regulation policy for the country.\nThis latest consultation paper is the most in-depth review of cryptocurrencies from South African financial institutions since an initial public statement on what it calls crypto assets was issued by South African authorities back in 2014.\nThe group that was responsible for putting together this consultation paper is comprised of the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC), the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA), the National Treasury (NT), the South African Revenue Service (SARS) and the South African Reserve Bank (SARB).\nAs Cointelegraph previously reported, South Africa has taken a conservatively optimistic approach toward cryptocurrencies. The sector has been relatively unregulated, allowing blockchain-based businesses like cryptocurrency exchanges to operate, but SARS imposed taxes on crypto gains and investors were cautioned about the associated risks of investments made.\nOver the next few years, the cryptocurrency industry grew exponentially, and the surge of interest led to the establishment of an Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group (IFWG), which began developing a review for regulators and policymakers focused on fintech, taking into account the implications for the financial sector and economy of South Africa.\nThe IFWG has described its approach to fintech as balanced, weighing up the benefits and risks of the sector.\nAt the beginning of 2018, the IFWG began its review and the release of the consultancy paper is the culmination of a year\u2019s work. Reviewing the current state of cryptocurrency-focused activities, two specific use cases have been analysed by the IFWG. This includes the buying and selling of crypto assets, and transactions made with crypto assets.\nBreaking it down\nThe consultation paper provides a complete breakdown of the perceived risks and benefits of crypto-related activities and goes on to present recommendations for policies toward crypto assets from a South African perspective.\nMost importantly, the IFWG has called upon the South African public to give feedback on the paper and engage on the way forward, while making it clear that there was no intent to ban the use of cryptocurrency in the country.\n\nRisks\nThe paper analyses the perceived risks that cryptocurrencies could have on the South African economy. Firstly, it is noted that the rise of cryptocurrencies could pose a threat to the central bank\u2019s exclusive right to issue and control monetary supply in the country. Should the popularity of cryptocurrencies increase, this could then cause a decrease in the demand for fiat currency in South Africa.\nSecondly, the paper recognizes the potential risks posed to financial stability, should the market capitalization grow to over $1 trillion. This figure is said to be psychological barrier that would lead to regulatory scrutiny by financial institutions and lawmakers around the world.\nThirdly, the paper suggests cryptocurrencies could pose a threat to the national payment system. Should cryptocurrencies gain massive adoption, there is fear that they will compete with the national payment system, with little to no regulatory oversight.\nWhile the risks mentioned are hypothetical, the need for a regulatory response has been prompted by concerns already experienced in South Africa. This includes the need for consumer protection while preventing possible misuse for money laundering and terrorist financing, exchange control evasion, illicit transactions, tax evasion and a lack of market stability.\nBenefits\nThe paper also notes the benefits that cryptocurrencies could provide South Africans.\nLocal investors could find some solace investing in cryptocurrencies, which are an asset class not tied to the risks created by political and economic instability in the country.\nThe anonymity of cryptocurrencies is also recognized as a potential benefit and drawcard for investors. Furthermore, an increased demand for cryptocurrencies in the country could see the premium paid by investors reduced by a greater supply of cryptocurrency exchanges.\nFurthermore, the working group notes the often-touted benefits of cryptocurrencies \u2014 including fast, low fee, anonymous and encrypted transactions \u2014 but a lack of working use cases proving these points has led to the belief that major adoption won\u2019t be seen in the medium to long term.\nPondering the way forward\nCryptocurrency regulation has been the subject heavy debate around the world, with many countries taking varying stances. Given that the nature of cryptocurrencies is essentially borderless, this makes it very challenging from a regulatory perspective.\nWith this in mind, the report identifies two possible approaches to cryptocurrency regulation.\nThe first is enforcing regulations on cryptocurrencies in accordance with existing legislature. This effectively leaves businesses involved in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries bound to actual laws.\nThe second is a more forward-thinking approach. The South African report cites the American \u00a0Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s (CFTC) \u201cdo-not-harm\u201d approach, which emphasizes innovation in the financial system.\nThe major focus is avoiding overregulation, which would tend to stifle innovation of the sector.\nNaturally, a balanced approach seems to be the ideal way forward. The South African report makes reference to researcher Jan Lansky\u2019s suggestions of country-specific approaches to cryptocurrencies, as seen below.\nThe classification ranges from 0 to 5, with 0 on one side of the spectrum, where countries completely ignore cryptocurrencies, and 5 is the opposite, where a country has either enforced bans or fully integrated.\n\nAccording to this measurement system, South Africa registers at level 2, given the paper released by SARS in 2018, which enforced normal income tax rules on cryptocurrencies.\nBetter compliance is the aim\nWith this in mind, the working group would like to see South Africa climb further up the level of classification of Lansky\u2019s matrix.\nPerhaps most importantly, South Africans don\u2019t have to worry about any impending bans on the use of cryptocurrencies. The working group made in clear that there were no plans to ban the buying, selling or holding of cryptocurrency.\nThe report concedes that a certain level of regulation is needed. To this end, specific requirements will be set out to meet Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) standards.\nPositive response in South Africa\nThe report seems to have been met with positive responses in South Africa. According to Marius Reitz, Luno\u2019s South Africa country manager, the daily volumes have exceeded 1,200 BTC per day on its South African exchange in recent months:\n\u201cThese numbers demonstrate the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies in South Africa and across the globe and reinforces our aim of upgrading the world to a better financial system.\u201d", "birthday": "2019-01-22T17:10:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-22 17:10:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 22}

Inside Blockchains\u2019 Ongoing Transactions-Per-Second Race ", "content": "Open-source project Qtum representatives claim that their enterprise blockchain dubbed \u2018QtumX\u2019 can accommodate \u201cmore than 10,000\u201d transactions per second (TPS), according to a press release recently shared with Cointelegraph.\nWith yet another player being added to the scalability race, it makes sense to look back and see how the main blockchains and cryptocurrencies stand in regard to TPS \u2014 and whether their numbers are actually authentic.\nTransaction speed: How important is it?\nScalability is one of cryptocurrencies\u2019 main issues, especially when it comes to the older coins. In fact, one of the first public comments on Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) white paper opened with the following line: \u201cWe very, very much need such a system, but the way I understand your proposal, it does not seem to scale to the required size.\u201d\nTen years on, the problem still persists \u2014 the original blockchain can reportedly process only around seven TPS, which eventually led to dire consequences. At the end of 2017, Bitcoin users had to pay around $28 in fees so their transactions wouldn\u2019t take days to complete. Those problems resulted in a hard fork and a new Bitcoin-based currency, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which moved on to increase the maximum block size up to eight megabytes from just one.\nMany other, newer cryptocurrencies have since attempted to create their own blockchains, which are allegedly faster and cheaper. Their primary goal was often to beat the ultimate crypto nemesis, the centralized global payment system Visa, which can process 24,000 TPS, according to the IBM study conducted back in 2010. Many blockchains have since surpassed that point during their scalability race, but only on paper.\nIt is important to recognize that while TPS, confirmation time and scalability in general might be important for the long-awaited mass adoption to come, they are not the only criteria. Many cryptocurrencies claim to have high TPS performance these days, but the transaction speed is often dependable and is generally hard to measure \u2014 especially with real-time traffic instead of test networks, with their ideal conditions in terms of latency. As a result, many of the claimed TPS are different from their actual value.\nBesides, even with a high TPS, the demand might not be there. This has been clearly visualized on the Txstreet website, where every transaction is pictured as a person, and they fill up buses that represent the block space of BTC and BCH. BCH has more buses \u2014 as its block size is bigger \u2014 but few passengers to fill them. On contrary, while there are just two buses for BTC, they fill quickly, and a lot of people are left crowded on the pavement, waiting to hop on the next block. Even the above mentioned Visa, which has the capacity to run at 24,000 TPS, reportedly does only 2,000 TPS on average, and up to 4,000 during peak hours \u2014 in other words, it doesn\u2019t need more at this point.\n\nQtum\nClaimed TPS capacity: 10,000\nQtum developers recently ran the blockchain\u2019s benchmark on Amazon EC2 virtual server and, according to its own estimations, QtumX \u201cis able to handle more than 10,000 TPS.\u201d They stress that, due to the high speed, transactions are supposedly confirmed as soon as they are sent to the network.\nIt is important to note that QtumX has not been audited by third parties, and it is therefore impossible to confirm the authenticity of Qtum\u2019s press release at this point. Similar to QtumX is Aelf, another business-oriented blockchain solution, whose development team reported achieving as many as 15,000 TPS during the initial test run in August 2018.\nRipple\nClaimed TPS capacity: 50,000 (estimated: 1,500)\nAccording to Ripple, XRP, the digital asset used in the company\u2019s cross-border payment system, \u201cconsistently handles 1,500 transactions per second.\u201d Moreover, it allegedly takes just around four seconds for payments to settle, while XRP can scale up to 50,000 TPS \u201cto handle the same throughput as Visa.\u201d\nHowever, unlike most other currencies mentioned in this article, Ripple doesn\u2019t have a blockchain. For that purpose, the company has its own patented technology: the Ripple protocol consensus algorithm. Consequently, XRP has been disregarded as a cryptocurrency by part of the community.\nEthereum\nEstimated TPS capacity: 15\nEthereum (ETH) scales poorly even despite a large amount of miners: Currently, its blockchain accommodates around 20 TPS. However, the situation is likely to change once ETH moves from the proof-of-work (PoW) to the proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm.\nThat will reportedly be implemented in the new protocol called Casper \u2014 Friendly Finality Gadget, which will also employ sharding on top of PoS. Cointelegraph has covered the protocol in greater detail in a separate article.\nHowever, Ethereum developers have been failing to run upgrades on time. Most recently, they rescheduled the Constantinople hard fork to late February after finding a vulnerability hours prior to the original time of release. Therefore, it is unclear when exactly Casper will be introduced. However, it might arrive as soon as this year, according to its developers.\nEOS\nClaimed TPS capacity: 3,996 (estimated: 50)\nIn July 2018, EOS\u2019s chief technology officer, Daniel Larimer, tweeted that its cryptocurrency was performing at 2,351 TPS. A few months later, blockchain testing company Whiteblock published results of \u201cthe first independent benchmark testing of the EOS software.\u201d The report showed that with \u201creal world conditions\u201d of round-trip latency and 0.01 percent packet loss, EOS performance was actually below 50 TPS, \u201cputting the system in close proximity to the performance that exists in Ethereum.\u201d\nLater, the EOS Alliance, a nonprofit organization formed by EOS community members and block producers with the role to \u201cfacilitate the dialogue within community,\u201d published a response signed by its interim executive director, Thomas Cox. It criticized Whiteblock\u2019s \u201cprovocative paper,\u201d noting that the benchmarking firm \u201conly recruited Ethereum folks for the project.\u201d\nStellar\nClaimed TPS capacity: 1,000\nStellar (XLM) is a payment technology built on the Ripple protocol. However, unlike its parent company, Stellar aims to work with developing markets instead of banking systems and other well-established financial institutes.\nStellar has been reported to have different TPS. Thus, according to an employee at Light Year, a network powered by Stellar, its blockchain can process up to 1,000 TPS. However, as per Barclays Africa's chief executive for corporate and investment banking, Stephen van Coller, a test of the Stellar-powered prototype found that it could process 36 million transactions an hour using Google cloud servers, which is around 10,000 TPS.\nLitecoin\nEstimated TPS capacity: 56\nLitecoin (LTC) is reported to handle 56 TPS on its blockchain.

User interfaces that are difficult to understand represent a major barrier to entry, with slow transaction speeds frustrating open-minded people who are trying to use the technology for the first time.\nAn upcoming\u00a0blockchain network says change is desperately needed if crypto is ever going to reach its full potential and enjoy mass adoption.

Continual headlines about massive amounts of crypto being stolen have shaken consumer confidence further. WON also believes that decentralization \u2014 a major selling point for many blockchain-driven companies \u2014 has enabled illicit activities to take place and \"facilitated the trade of dubious products and services.\"\nA force for good\nWON says its goal is to create a global community that encourages \"diversity, innovation and sustainable growth\" \u2014 and move the industry away from a \"vicious cycle\" where greed dominates.\nIts website says: \"WON inspires and encourages people to do valuable actions and make decisions which support social responsibility.

The fateful 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto treatise did not appear in an ideological vacuum: Notions of online privacy, proactive use of cryptography for protecting individual freedom, and denationalization of currency that informed the Bitcoin creator\u2019s vision had been brewing for at least two decades, at least since the rise of the\u00a0cypherpunk movement in the early 1990s. The libertarian spirit of individual sovereignty and suspicion of governments and central banks has dominated the intellectual milieu where the concept of digital cash was forged and developed into a working technology.\nAs cryptocurrencies went more mainstream, the core community\u2019s ideological purity has somewhat diluted \u2014 however, even in 2018, almost half of crypto users\u00a0identified as either libertarian or conservative, another label that, in the context of the United States, captures a lot of the individual liberty and anti-big government sentiment.\nYet, there is another sizable and highly visible group on the right, markedly different from classic libertarians, that is being increasingly drawn to cryptocurrencies for more instrumental than ideological reasons. Often self-identified as conservative or ultra-conservative, the whole ecosystem of hate-mongers, online trolls and conspiracy ideologues \u2014 in the mainstream discourse, most often labelled interchangeably as the far-right or alt-right \u2014 is turning to crypto as mainstream corporate financial platforms face pressure to disrupt their financial infrastructure.\nThe boundaries of free speech\nIn recent years, a previously fringe movement of radical white nationalists came into the spotlight in the U.S., fueled by growing disenchantment of neoliberal identity politics, a subversive\u00a0meme culture and increasing fragmentation of online\u00a0media ecosystems. Much like original crypto-libertarians, those in the alt-right don\u2019t like the incumbent institutions of political and economic power, albeit their reasons are largely different. They take issue with the government because they see it as a major instrument in an insidious plot to undermine the dominance of white people in the Western world. Another weapon in this fight, some of them\u00a0argue, is the incumbent financial system, run by Jews and designed to perpetuate their veiled power.\nThe First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, designed to preserve citizens\u2019 right for dissent against an oppressive government, extends protections to any kind of expression that pertains to the sphere of politics, no matter how outlandish or even hateful it may be.\nA chain of Supreme Court\u00a0decisions throughout the 20th century expanded the realm of protected speech so far that even the most extreme expression is safe from government censorship. This practice stands in stark contrast with the policies of some\u00a0European countries, where governments actively engage in suppressing what they deem to be hate speech.\nThe U.S. Constitution, however, only protects political expression from governmental encroachment, while no such restrictions exist for digital platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. The only policies that govern their relationships with user-generated content that these private entities host on their servers are user agreements of their own making, which are up for reversal at any time. This does not automatically mean that tech giants are quick to censor the content that the majority of their audiences would find ugly. Such corporate players are towing a thin middle ground between the demands of the outraged public and the imperative to maintain the image of a value-neutral infrastructure for any and all expression, which is essential to their business\u2019s success.\nThis struggle is real not only for those platforms that provide a forum for speech, but financial services as well. In the best traditions of American constitutional jurisprudence, online political expression these days is not limited to posting slogans and proclamations \u2014 it also extends to fundraising in the name of those who propagate political ideas. Whereas the alleged censorship and \u201cshadow banning\u201d of conservative accounts by the likes of Facebook and Twitter is hardly a new trope, the relatively fresh trend is public activism that is aimed at pressuring financial infrastructure providers into purging right-wing extremists from their platforms.\nDeplatforming haters\nNot long ago, a whole pantheon of far-right media personalities was thriving on their capacity to convert attention, views and clicks into real money. But at some point, the fortunes of many began to reverse, as services like Google Pay, PayPal and Patreon cut their accounts off.\nSometimes, the pattern followed conspicuous events such as the deadly \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville in August 2017, after which PayPal\u00a0banned the National Policy Institute, a group closely tied to nationalist leader Richard Spencer, from receiving electronic payments.\nYet, the more common strategy for payment processing firms has been to\u00a0deny that dropping odious public figures from the services had anything to do with their politics. In many instances, it took activist groups such as\u00a0Deplatform Hate and\u00a0Hope Not Hate to catalyze the process.\nPatreon, a subscription-based platform designed to enable consumers to reward content creators, has been arguably the most outspoken in severing relationships with conspicuous extremist figures. Starting with the Canadian right-wing YouTube star Lauren Southern in July 2017, and on to the alt-right provocateur\u00a0Milo Yiannopoulos in December 2018, Patreon appeared to be the most responsive to the activist groups\u2019 advocacy efforts, as well as the most consistent in enforcing their anti-hate speech community guidelines in removing controversial characters\u2019 accounts. This immediately incited accusations of double standards and anti-conservative bias from the right.\nOther influencers have exited Patreon voluntarily, protesting against what they perceived as censorship and encroachment on free speech. Among the latest renegades were the libertarian political commentator\u00a0Dave Rubin and the Canadian psychologist\u00a0Jordan Peterson, who has earned a cult following among the right-leaning, tech-savvy youth.\nWhile most observers agree that deplatforming is an efficient strategy for halting hate groups\u2019 public activity, not everyone sees it as a cure-all that comes with no strings attached. The UK educator and far-right commentator Mike Stuchbery told Cointelegraph:\n\u201cI'm reluctant to call for the blanket banning of those who engage in hate speech on social media - not only does it set a problematic precedent, but as we have seen, the Far Right is able to skillfully turn such calls into a Free Speech debate.\u201d\nMeanwhile, facing increasing pressure from the mainstream electronic payments industry, many alt-right figures doubled down on their previously nonexistent or peripheral cryptocurrency fundraising infrastructure.\nWhite supremacy coins", "birthday": "2019-01-21T10:36:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-21 10:36:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 21}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nMarcus Hughes, the United Kingdom lead counsel for major United States crypto exchange and wallet provider Coinbase, expects huge developments for Bitcoin (BTC) in the next two years.\nHughes is confident about the European Union coming up with a more defined regulatory framework for crypto in 2019. After the regulations are in place, Hughes anticipates large investment banks to finally enter the scene.\nU.K.-based investor and entrepreneur Alistair Milne is confident that Bitcoin will break out of its lifetime high and sustain above it. He has based his opinion on the anticipated increase of the level of adoption of the leading cryptocurrency. Milne is certain that Bitcoin will survive for another 100 years.\nSimilar to how prices tend to overshoot to the upside during a bull market, they also usually overshoot to the downside. Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, believes that a lot of development has taken place in the crypto space, implying that cryptocurrencies are currently undervalued.\nSo should the traders start buying? Let\u2019s find out. \u00a0\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) has been trading below the moving averages since Jan. 10. Attempts by the bulls to push the price higher have been met with selling at the moving averages. This is a bearish sign.\nThe cryptocurrency hasn\u2019t been able to make a higher high and a higher low, a signal that we were watching out for. A set of higher highs and higher lows would indicate a probable change in trend.\n\nIf the bears force the price below $3,236.09, it will be a new lower low that would confirm the continuation of the downtrend.\nThe first sign of a probable change in trend will be when the BTC/USD pair breaks out of the downtrend line and sustains above it. The recovery will gain strength if the bulls scale above $4,255. Until then, every rise to the resistance levels will be sold into.\nWe might suggest long positions closer to $3,236.09 if the price rebounds sharply from the support, because that would indicate a strong demand at lower levels. Another probable trade can be taken on a breakout above $4,255. Until then, we suggest traders remain in a wait and see mode.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) has been trading in a tight range since Jan. 11. This is unlikely to continue for long. We expect either a breakout or breakdown from this range within the next few days.\n\nThe downtrending moving averages and the RSI in the negative area suggest that sellers are at an advantage. If the bears force a breakdown below the range, the XRP/USD pair can drop to $0.27795.\nOn the other hand, if the bulls push the price above the moving averages and the downtrend line, the digital currency can move up to $0.4. We suggest traders wait for a bullish pattern to form before jumping in to buy.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) plummeted below the immediate support of $116.3 on Jan. 20, but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. The bulls pulled back from the lows and closed (UTC time frame) above the support line.\n\nIf the ETH/USD pair fails to find buyers at higher levels and reverses direction, it can fall to $107.51, and if that support also breaks, a drop to $83 will be possible. The downtrending 20-day EMA, as well as the RSI in the negative territory confirm that the sellers have the upper hand in the short term.\nThe digital currency will show strength if it breaks out of $134.5. It can then rally to $167.32, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has been trading in a tight range of $120\u2013$137.26 for the past 10 days. This shows that both the buyers and the sellers have stopped actively trading it.\n\nIf the bears push the price below $120, the BCH/USD pair can plunge further to $100, and below that a retest of the lows around $73.5 will be probable. The falling moving averages, and the RSI below 40 levels suggest that the sellers have the upper hand.\nOur bearish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency scales above both the moving averages and the $137.26 mark. We shall wait for a reliable buy setup to form before proposing a trade.\nEOS/USD\nEOS is currently range bound between $2.3093 and $3.2081. The bears are attempting to break down of the range, while the bulls are trying to defend it.\n\nOn Jan. 13 and 14, the EOS/USD pair bounced off the support of the range, but the bulls could not carry it above the 20-day EMA. This is a bearish sign. Any break of the immediate support of the range, and the $2.1733 mark, can result in a fall to $1.7746, and further to $1.55.\nOur bearish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency bounces off the support of the range and sustains above $2.5840. If that happens, a rally to the resistance of the range at $3.2081 will be possible. We might suggest long positions above $2.6.\nXLM/USD\nThe bulls attempted to carry Stellar (XLM) higher on Jan. 19, but could not scale the 20-day EMA. Currently, the bears are attempting to break down of the immediate support at $0.10235190.\n\nIf they are successful, a drop to the yearly low of $0.09285498 will be probable. If this level breaks down, the XLM/USD pair will resume its downtrend. Both moving averages are sloping down, and the RSI is in the negative zone, which suggests that the bears have the upper hand.\nThe first sign of a likely change in trend will be when the bulls succeed in pushing the price above the downtrend line of the symmetrical triangle. A confirmation of strength will be when the pair sustains above $0.13427050. We shall wait for a trend reversal before recommending a long position.\nLTC/USD\nThe bears are not allowing Litecoin (LTC) to sustain above the 20-day EMA, while the bulls are not allowing the price to plummet below $29.349.\n\nIf the LTC/USD pair plunges below $29.349, it could slide further to $27.701, below which a fall to the yearly lows of $23.090 will be likely. The downtrend will resume if the price breaks down to new yearly lows.\nConversely, if the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the virtual currency could rally to $36.428, and beyond that to $40.784. The flat moving averages and the RSI close to 50 levels suggests a balance between the buyers and the sellers.\nThe next move will happen when this balance tilts in favor of either of the parties. For now, the traders who own long positions can keep a stop loss at $27.5.\nTRX/USD\nTron (TRX) has corrected to the 20-day EMA, which might act as a support. However, if the bears break below this support, a fall to $0.02113440, followed by a drop to the 50-day SMA will be probable.\n\nThe TRX/USD pair has been range bound since Aug. 8, 2018. Attempts to break out or break down of this range have been unsuccessful and the price always returned into the range.\nThere are two possible trade opportunities. The traders can either buy closer to $0.0183 and expect the price to reach $0.02815521, or they can buy on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.02815521.\nThe uptrending moving averages suggest that the bulls have the upper hand. We shall turn negative on the cryptocurrency if the price slumps and sustains below $0.0183.\nBSV/USD\nBitcoin SV (BSV) is gradually giving up ground, which shows a lack of buying support at the current levels. If the price sustains below $74.022, a drop to the next support at $65.031 will be probable.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is gradually sloping down, and the RSI is in the negative territory. This shows that the bears have an advantage in the short term. If the BSV/USD pair breaks below $65.031, it will result in liquidation of long trades. The supports on the downside are at $57, and below that at $38.528.", "birthday": "2019-01-21T23:37:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-21 23:37:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 21}

As of Tuesday, Jan. 15, new regulations governing cryptocurrencies have come into effect in Malaysia.\nAccording to reports, the new regulation has classified cryptocurrencies, tokens and crypto assets as securities, which means they are now under the jurisdiction of the Malaysian Securities Commission.\nIn accordance with the change, any unauthorized cryptocurrency exchanges or initial coin offering (ICO) could face a 10-year jail sentence and fines to the tune of $2.4 million.\n\nWhile the change may seem harsh at face value, the punishments for those not adhering to regulations are just the worst-case scenario.\nAccording to various sources, the Malaysian government has expressed positive sentiments toward cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, even though they\u2019ve taken a hard line in classifying all cryptocurrencies as securities.\nMalaysia\u2019s positive outlook, despite blanket treatment\nMalaysian news outlet The Star noted the positive attitude toward the sector, as Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng delivered the enforcement of the new regulations. According to Eng, the Malaysian government sees the potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to improve a number of sectors of its economy:\n\u201cThe Ministry of Finance views digital assets, as well as its underlying blockchain technologies, as having the potential to bring about innovation in both old and new industries. In particular, we believe digital assets have a role to play as an alternative fundraising avenue for entrepreneurs and new businesses, and an alternate asset class for investors.\u201d\nThis change in sentiment has come swiftly, considering that a Malaysian government minister had said the government was still undecided in its stance on cryptocurrencies last week.\nFederal Territories Minister Khalid Abdul Samad made this statement on Jan. 12, according to New Strait Times:\n\u201cPeople have asked me if these (cryptocurrency and digital currency) currencies are legal or illegal. At the moment, the answer is neither legal nor illegal as the situation is still unclear.\u201d\nNevertheless, the final outcome has met the timeline set out by the Malaysian government back in 2018. In December, the finance regulator and central bank had earmarked a final decision on regulation for the first quarter of 2019.\nEffendy Zulkifly, who founded Crypto Valley Malaysia, told Cointelegraph that there was already a high level of awareness at a governmental level in the country, with the Central Bank of Malaysia creating a fintech sandbox and setting up a cryptocurrency unit.\nZulkifly believes the move is a positive one for businesses operating in the cryptocurrency space within Malaysia, as it removes any uncertainty around the legality of their operations:\n\u201cIt is a good thing for the cryptocurrency market because we can [sic] a clear direction and are now recognised by government. There\u2019s no need to be scared and no need to hide anymore. We can just follow the requirements by the government and do an ICO without fear anymore. For example, the Switzerland government is a model that recognised ICOs in their country. Their economy got stronger because the value of ICOs as Foreign Direct Investment.\u201d\nHarapan Coin\nWhile the Malaysian government has been contemplating the direction to take with cryptocurrencies, there\u2019s been plenty of controversy around a local cryptocurrency project linked to a political party.\nAs previously reported by Cointelegraph, the Harapan Coin came into existence in 2017 and has since been touted as a cryptocurrency used for funding a coalition of opposition political parties leading up to the country\u2019s 2018 elections.\nThe Barisan Nasional had been in control of the country since its independence in 1957, but finally conceded power in 2018, when the Pakatan Harapan coalition took a majority of seats in the lower parliament.\nOvercoming the lengthy stay of power was used as a major fighting point by opposing parties, and the Harapan Coin was directly linked to funding these opposition parties.\nThere has been some controversy surrounding this particular aspect of the project. The identities of people working on the project are obscure, and more than half of the funds raised has been allocated to system administrators and one of the political parties within the Pakatan coalition.\nThe Harapan Coin has been promoted by Khalid Samad, the Malaysian Minister of Federal Territories mentioned above. Overall, the project seemed to have been held at arm's length by the Malaysian financial authorities and civil society groups.\nA blanket approach\nThe Malaysian government and financial regulator have made a clear-cut decision to define cryptocurrencies as securities. The decision may have some interesting ramifications, but it's a decision that gives clarity to businesses operating in the country.\nIt is, however, a very different approach compared to a country like the United States, which has taken an extended amount of time to consider how it should regulate cryptocurrencies and virtual assets.\nRegulations governing securities have been applied to cryptocurrencies around the world in order to provide some sort of guideline to a technology and medium of exchange that is still in its infancy.\nWith that being said, the U.S. is looking to move in a different direction from the one taken by Malaysia. In December 2018, two U.S. congressman introduced a draft bill that hopes to exclude digital assets from being defined as securities.\n\nThe bill wants the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to adjust taxes related to virtual currencies, create a tax exemption for the exchange of different cryptocurrency tokens, as well as a change to the taxation of capital gains made on the sale and exchange of cryptocurrencies. The proposal essentially wants cryptocurrencies to be considered for what they are, and regulated in a manner that is fair to their use cases.\nA prime example was the consideration of Ethereum as security, due to the nature of its token sale in 2014. American regulators looked long and hard at the situation before a final decision was taken to not consider Ethereum as a security in June 2018.\nHowever, the simple truth is that Malaysia\u2019s take effectively throws a blanket over all cryptocurrencies, ICO\u2019s and their tokens. \u00a0For now, exchanges and blockchain companies will have to play by the rules or suffer the consequences laid out by Malaysian regulators this week.", "birthday": "2019-01-18T14:50:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-18 14:50:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 18}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nIn a recent interview with Cointelegraph, Sterling Witzke, partner at Winklevoss Capital, claimed that institutional investors are looking into the cryptocurrency industry, but are not quite ready to take the big plunge yet.\nAccording to her, the unfavorable regulatory environment in the United States and the lack of adequate security measures in are two major factors that need to be sorted out if institutions are to make a decisive entry.\nCompanies are trying various approaches to opening up Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to the mainstream audience.\nOne such attempt is by Bitcoin ATM company Coinme that has partnered with coins-to-cash converter Coinstar. The two companies aim to facilitate buying Bitcoin through Coinstar kiosks that are going to be put up at grocery stores throughout various countries.\nAs if the number of existing cryptocurrencies was not enough, researchers from seven top U.S. Universities have come together to launch a \u201cglobally scalable decentralized payments network.\u201d This shows that some of the top minds in the industry are positive on the prospects of cryptocurrencies in the future.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin\u2019s (BTC) volatility has declined sharply in the past three days. We anticipate a resolution of this tight range within the next few days. Both moving averages are either flat or marginally sloping down. The RSI is in the negative zone. This shows that the path of least resistance is to the downside.\n\nA breakdown of $3,473.47 can push the BTC/USD pair towards the year-to-date low of $3,236.09. On the contrary, if the bulls push the price above the moving averages, a rally to $4,000 is possible. We anticipate a strong resistance in the zone of $4,000\u2013$4,255.\nIf the bulls scale this zone, the leading cryptocurrency might start a new uptrend. We shall wait for a reliable buy setup to form before recommending any trades in it. Until then, it is best to remain on the sidelines.\nXRP/USD\nThe failure of Ripple (XRP) to break out of the moving averages will attract sellers. A breakdown of $0.31121 can lead to a decline to $0.27795.\n\nThe trend is down as the XRP/USD pair continues to trade inside the descending channel. Both of the moving averages have turned down marginally and the RSI is in the negative zone, which suggests that the bears have the upper hand.\nThe first sign of a probable trend reversal will be a breakout and close above the downtrend line. Such a move can see the price move to $0.4, and above it to the resistance line of the channel. We couldn\u2019t find a reliable trade setup at the current levels, so we are not suggesting any new long positions.\nETH/USD\nThough the bulls have successfully defended the 50-day SMA for the past four days, they haven\u2019t been able to push Ethereum (ETH) above the 20-day EMA.\n\nThe 20-day EMA sloping down and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that the bears have the advantage in the short term. A breakdown of $116.3 will increase the probability of a fall to $100, and further to $83.\nHowever, if the bulls push the price higher, a breakout above $140 can carry the ETH/USD pair towards the next overhead resistance of $167.32. We shall wait for a confirmed change in trend before proposing a trade in it.\nBCH/USD\nThe volatility in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has shrunk dramatically in the past three days, which shows a lack of both buying and selling interest.\n\nIf the buyers return in large numbers and push the BCH/USD pair above the moving averages, a rally to $177.3 will be probable.\nNonetheless, if the bears sink the digital currency below $121.3, a decline to $100, and below that to $73.5, will be possible.\nEOS/USD\nThough EOS continues to trade inside the range of $2.3093\u2013$3.2081, the bulls are struggling to push the price above the 20-day EMA.\n\nA breakdown of the range and $2.1733 can push the EOS/USD pair towards $1.7746, and below that to the recent low of $1.55.\nConversely, if the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the cryptocurrency might reach the top of the range. With both of the moving averages flat and the RSI marginally in the negative zone, a consolidation is likely.\nXLM/USD\nThe intraday range has tightened further in Stellar (XLM). The bulls and the bears are in a state of balance.\n\nA break below $0.010235190 will increase the probability of a retest of $0.09285498, below which the downtrend will resume.\nIf the bulls push the XLM/USD pair above the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA, a move to $0.13427050 will be possible. A break out of this level will be the first indication that the trend is about to reverse. Currently, we couldn\u2019t find any bullish patterns, so we are not suggesting a trade.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) has been trading between the moving averages for the past four days. Such a tight range is unlikely to sustain for a long time.\n\nAfter this period of low volatility, we expect the range to expand in the next few days. However, it is difficult to predict which way the break will happen because the moving averages are flat and the RSI is also just below the 50 levels.\nIf the LTC/USD pair scales above the 20-day EMA, it might attempt to move up to $36.428, and further to $40.784. However, if the bears sink the virtual currency below the support zone of $27.701\u2013$29.349, a fall to $23.090 will be probable. Therefore, long positions should be protected with a stop loss at $27.5.\nTRX/USD\nFor the past two days, Tron (TRX) has been trading inside the intraday high and low formed on Jan. 15 of this year.\n\nA breakout and close above the overhead resistance zone of $0.02733572\u2013$0.02815521 might start a new uptrend that could carry the TRX/USD pair to $0.04.\nOn the other hand, if the price breaks down of the 20-day EMA, it might correct to $0.0211344, and below it to $0.0183. We suggest traders either buy closer to $0.0183, or on a close above $0.02815521 (UTC time frame). We couldn\u2019t find any reliable trades inside the range.\nBSV/USD\nNot much is happening in Bitcoin SV (BSV) as it remains stuck inside a very tight range of $74.022\u2013$88.722.\n\nA breakdown of this tight range will lead to a retest of $65.031. A break of this level will trigger the liquidation of long positions that can plunge the BSV/USD pair further to $57, and below that to $38.528.", "birthday": "2019-01-18T22:35:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-18 22:35:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 18}

According to the report, the decrease in value from 2017 to 2018 is attributable to the closure of popular darknet market Alphabay in mid-2017, which reportedly saw darknet market activity fall by 60 percent.\n", "birthday": "2019-01-19T12:58:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-19 12:58:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 19}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/huobi-secures-its-fsa-license-in-japan-other-large-players-are-pending", "title": " Huobi Secures Its FSA License in Japan, Other Large Players Are Pending ", "content": "On Jan. 17, Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Huobi, one of the largest players on the market, relaunched as a fully licensed platform in Japan after merging with the BitTrade exchange.\nBranching out to Japan, where compliance is valued and many regulatory measures are imposed for crypto players by domestic regulators, is a complex process. Here\u2019s how Huobi entered the market, and which firms might soon follow suit.\nSpecifics of the Japanese market and the FSA\u2019s role in it\nJapan is one of the world\u2019s largest markets for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins can be used as a legally accepted means of payment there, although they are not considered \u201clegal tender.\u201d Being closely overseen by the national financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), the Japanese crypto market is also one of the most compliant and regulation-oriented.\nSince the amendment of Japan\u2019s Payment Services Act in April 2017, all crypto exchanges in the country are required to register with the FSA. Counting Huobi\u2019s recent merger with BitTrade, the pool of exchanges cleared to serve the Japanese market currently consists of 17 platforms: Money Partners, Liquid (previously known as Quoine), Bitflyer, BitBank, SBI Virtual Currencies, GMO Coin, Btcbox, Bitpoint, Fisco Virtual Currency, Zaif, Tokyo Bitcoin Exchange, Bit Arg Exchange Tokyo, FTT Corporation, Xtheta Corporation, Huobi and Coincheck.\nThe FSA is known to have a tight grip on local exchanges, firmly reacting to security breaches after a number of high-profile local crypto exchange incidents, namely last year\u2019s bizzare $532 million Coincheck hack and the infamous collapse of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox. The FSA also conducts on-site inspections of exchanges that have their registration pending and occasionally asks exchanges to submit their risk management system reports in the wake of security breaches.\nFor instance, in March 2018, following the Coincheck hack, the watchdog sent \u201cpunishment notices\u201d to as many as seven crypto exchanges and temporarily froze the activities of two more after a round of inspections. Business improvement orders were sent for a lack of \u201cthe proper and required internal control systems,\u201d with Coincheck being specifically cited as missing a framework for preventing money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Shortly after the regulator\u2019s move, two local exchanges \u2014 Mr. Exchange and Tokyo GateWay \u2014 decided to close up shop.\nAs a result of the FSA\u2019s thorough supervision, some players have decided to quit the Japanese market. Binance, one of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges that had opened an office in the country, turned to Malta \u2014 the famously crypto-friendly country \u2014 after the regulator had issued a warning in March 2018. Similarly, around the same time, crypto exchange Kraken also decided to end its services in Japan, although citing the rising costs of doing business there as the primary reason for relocation. Japanese social messaging app Line has also decided to exclude the domestic market prior to the launch of its cryptocurrency exchange, citing local regulatory difficulties.\nIn May of last year, the FSA rolled out further regulatory stipulations for domestic crypto exchanges, intensifying its efforts to prevent another major hack. Exchanges were required to monitor customer accounts multiple times per day for suspicious fluctuations and must comply with stricter Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures, which specifically demand Know Your \u00a0Customer (KYC) checks, such as ID verification. There have also been reports regarding the FSA potentially prohibiting the trading of anonymity-oriented altcoins \u2014 such as Dash (DASH) and Monero (XMR) \u2014 in the future.\nIn July, the agency underwent a major redo aimed at improving its presence in fintech-related fields, including cryptocurrencies. Thus, the Strategy Development and Management Bureau replaced the Inspection Bureau to develop a financial strategy policy and handle issues addressing the digital currencies market, fintech and money laundering.The Policy and Markets Bureau, in turn, succeeded the Planning and Coordination Bureau, and was tasked with developing a legal framework that addresses the rapid growth of the fintech sector.\nIn August 2018, Toshihide Endo, the commissioner of the FSA, said that his agency wants the cryptocurrency industry to \u201cgrow under appropriate regulation.\u201d The official added:\n\u201cWe have no intention to curb [the crypto industry] excessively. We would like to see it grow under appropriate regulation.\u201d\nIn response to regulatory pressures, a self-regulatory body named the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) has emerged, comprised of the local exchanges. In October 2018, Japan\u2019s financial regulator formally granted self-regulatory status to the JVCEA to oversee the crypto sector. Therefore, the JVCEA might have a better say when it comes to the industry standards in the future. Specifically, the self-regulatory outfit is now expected to develop AML policies for crypto exchanges.\nHuobi\u2019s way of getting the FSA clearance \u2014 and similar attempts from the past\nFounded in China in 2013, Huobi Group has been headquartered in Singapore since Beijing\u2019s crackdown on domestic crypto-fiat exchanges in September 2017. As part of its ongoing overseas expansion efforts, the platform has recently rebranded its United States-based strategic partner trading platform HBUS to the better recognized the Huobi name. Now, the platform \u2014 currently the world\u2019s sixth largest by daily traded volume \u2014 has expanded to the Japanese market. Huobi\u2019s arrival follows the news about Coincheck receiving full permission from the FSA to continue operating in the country after the above mentioned security breach.\nHuobi\u2019s press release emphasizes its security precaution, outlining that Huobi Japan \u201cfeatures specialized distributed architecture, a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack countermeasures system, and A+ ranked SSL certification (the highest available).\u201d\nAccording to the official announcement, Huobi Japan supports the trading of Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP) and Monacoin (MONA).\nImportantly, Huobi didn\u2019t receive the FSA license from scratch, going through a different route instead. Although Japan\u2019s Payment Services Act allows foreign operators to register in the country as \u201cvirtual currency exchange service providers,\u201d Huobi has relaunched as a fully licensed platform in Japan after acquiring a majority stake in BitTrade last September. At the time, BitTrade was one of only 16 crypto exchanges in the country to have secured a license from the FSA.\nHowever, Huobi\u2019s market expansion through acquisition of a pre-approved FSA platform is not an entirely new move: In June 2018, BitTrade became Japan\u2019s first FSA-licensed platform to be entirely purchased by an international investor, the Singaporean multi-millionaire and entrepreneur Eric Cheng. The investor also acquired BitTrade\u2019s affiliate company at the time, FX Trade Financial Co., Ltd \u2014 one of Japan's leading forex trading platforms. Following the Huobi deal, FX Trade Financial kept 25 percent of BitTrade\u2019s shares.\n\nMore exchanges to receive the FSA\u2019s blessing: Coinbase, Yahoo and others", "birthday": "2019-01-20T13:02:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-20 13:02:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 20}

Bakkt had previously announced a target launch date of the end of January, but the platform is still waiting on approval amid the United States\u2019 ongoing government shutdown.\nNew Wyoming Legislation Aims to Define Virtual Currencies as Money\nA bill introduced in the U.S. state of Wyoming this week is meant to define clarify the definition of cryptocurrency. According to the legislation, crypto assets will be placed in one of three categories: digital consumer assets, digital securities and virtual currencies. In the draft, banks will also be authorized to provide digital asset custodial services, and serve as qualified custodians in accordance with regulations put in place by the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC). The bill also grants virtual currencies the same treatment as fiat.\nAmerican University Researchers Jointly Launch Global Scalable Cryptocurrency\nA group of researchers from American universities announced this week that they are launching a globally scalable and decentralized payments network, with a cryptocurrency dubbed \u201cUnit-e.\u201d The development of the crypto is being funded by Distributed Technologies Research, a Swiss non-profit, with researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley, among others.

When speaking about the crypto market in general, Kelly did say that 2019 will end up better than 2018 as he believes that the bear market is almost over.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nBitcoin (BTC) has proven to be in high demand among citizens of smaller nations like Venezuela, whose economic conditions have been adversely affecting their fiat currencies.\nNow, cryptocurrencies will face another test with the impending Brexit deal. If the United Kingdom is forced to leave the European Union without a deal, experts believe that the pound will be hit hard, and might lose up to a quarter of its value.\nWith such uncertainty, will the market participants turn towards cryptocurrencies as an alternative source of investment or stick to the classical investment vehicles? We believe that digital currencies will make their presence felt because they are likely at the end of their year-long bear market. According to Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao, their new Jersey-based trading platform has witnessed a huge demand.\nCNBC contributor Brian Kelly expects cryptocurrencies to do well in 2019. Geopolitical tension in the world can boost the demand for digital currencies as the investors look to hedge their positions. However, Kelly doesn\u2019t anticipate an approval for Bitcoin ETF this year.\nBNB/USD\nBinance was the top performer among the major coins. The news of the launch of Binance Jersey, a fiat-to-crypto exchange for U.K, and European customers, was cheered by the investors. The company plans to capitalize on the uncertainty regarding Brexit and wants to offer the people an opportunity to diversify into cryptocurrencies. Binance also completed its 6th quarterly BNB token burn, roughly equivalent to $9.4 million. So, will its outperformance continue? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe BNB/USD pair is attempting to breakout of the resistance line of the descending channel. For the past four weeks, the bulls have defended the first support at $5.46666. Therefore, we anticipate another attempt to breakout of the channel within the next couple of weeks.\nA breakout of the channel will start a new uptrend that can carry the virtual currency to $15, with a minor resistance at $12. The traders can buy on a close (UTC time frame) above the channel and keep a stop loss below $5.\nContrary to our opinion, if the bulls fail to breakout of the channel, the bears will try to sink the digital currency below $5. \u00a0\nADA/USD\nCardano developer and CEO of IOHK Charles Hoskinson is excited about the forthcoming Project Shelly update. Cardano wallet \u201cDeadalus\u201d can also prove to be a major event, as it aims to be the most secure crypto wallet with a series of inbuilt protections. While some are confident about the prospects of the cryptocurrency, the critics feel that the developments are moving too slowly.\n\nAfter an extended downtrend, the ADA/USD pair has been trading inside the range $0.062424-$0.027237 for the past nine weeks. There was a similar attempt to bottom out previously (marked as ellipse on the chart) that resulted in a breakdown. That consolidation had also lasted for nine weeks before breaking down of it.\nIf the bears breakdown of the current range, the downtrend will resume. However, if the bulls scale the overhead resistance of $0.062424, we can expect the start of a new uptrend that can reach $0.094256 and above it to $0.2.\nAs the upside potential is high, traders can wait for a close (UTC time frame) above the range to initiate a long position.\nIOTA/USD\nIn the new year, IOTA has announced a couple of collaborations that can help it come on top. Though it has not run away, it has managed to close in the green in the past seven days. Can it move up from here and crack into the top 10? Let\u2019s see.\n\nThe IOTA/USD pair is currently trading inside a range. After failing to breakout of $0.4037 for four weeks, the bears pushed prices back in the week before. However, lower levels are attracting buying as the bulls try to stage a recovery from close to $0.272 levels.\nIf the virtual currency rises from the current levels, the bulls will again attempt to breakout from $0.4037. If successful, a rally to $0.6, followed by a move to the next overhead resistance of $0.8152, is probable.\nHowever, if the bears fail to force a turnaround at the current levels, a drop to $0.2051 is likely. If this support breaks, a retest of the critical support of $0.1427 will be on the cards. The downtrend will resume if this level gives way.\nNEO/USD\nNEO Co-Founder Erik Zhang confesses that he doesn\u2019t watch the daily price action of the virtual currency. \u00a0He is more concerned with its development. According to him, Ethereum might overtake Bitcoin in the future, and Ethereum itself will face competition from cryptocurrencies such as NEO. Can NEO reclaim its footing among the top 10 cryptocurrencies? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe NEO/USD pair has been trading inside a tight range for the past eight weeks. The attempt by the bulls to scale the range failed in the week before. However, the bears could not push the prices back to the bottom of the range: this shows demand for the digital currency close to $7 level.\nWe expect the bulls to again attempt to break out of the range. If successful, a rally to $16, followed by a move to $20 is probable.\nContrary to our expectations, if the bears plunge the virtual currency back below the range, the downtrend will resume. As the previous consolidations had resolved to the downside, we suggest traders wait for a close (UTC time frame) above $10 before initiating any long positions.", "birthday": "2019-01-20T16:23:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-20 16:23:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 20}

On its weekly chart, Ethereum\u2019s lowest price point was $115.16 on Jan. 13, while the weekly peak was reached on Jan. 10, at the $151.94 mark.\nAs Cointelegraph reported yesterday, Ethereum\u2019s Constantinople hard fork is facing another delay over a newly discovered security vulnerability allowing a reentrancy attack.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nAlthough cryptocurrency prices have so far been unable to stage a recovery, the companies in the industry are still launching products that are required by the institutional players.\nCryptocurrency asset manager LedgerX has launched a Bitcoin (BTC) price volatility index called LedgerX Volatility Index (LXVX) that will function as a \u201cbitcoin fear index,\u201d similar to how the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) works for the stock markets. Though the index is not tradeable currently, the company plans to make it so in the future.\nDespite the market-wide price plunge last year, crypto trading volumes have actually increased in 2018 vs 2017, according to a recent report by research firm Diar. This shows that the traders are still active in the space.\nIn a survey of United States consumers by Cornerstone Advisors, only 8 percent said that they own any cryptocurrency. Another 17 percent said that they might buy some in the near future. This implies that a lot of money is waiting to enter the markets when the trend changes.\nThe markets will look for clues from some of the important events expected to take place in 2019. Though crypto prices this year will remain well below their lifetime highs, we expect them to go much higher than the current levels.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin (BTC) is currently range bound between $3,236.09 and $4,255. The 20-day EMA has started to slope down, and the RSI is also in the negative territory. This suggests that the bears have the upper hand in the short term.\nThe immediate resistance is at the moving averages and above that at the downtrend line. One more resistance line is at $4,255.\n\nOn the downside, a slide below $3,473.47 can result in a retest of $3,236.09. A breakdown to new lows will severely dampen sentiment and trigger a few stops on the long positions. The next support is the psychological level of $3,000.\nThe BTC/USD pair is likely to indicate a clear direction within the next few days. Due to the uncertainty, we suggest traders wait until a new buy setup forms.\nXRP/USD\nRipple (XRP) failed to scale above the moving averages in the past two days. However, as it has not given up much ground, we anticipate another attempt by the bulls to scale the overhead resistance.\n\nIf successful, the XRP/USD pair can rally to the overhead resistance of $0.4, and above it to the resistance line of the descending channel. A break out of the channel will signal the probability of a change in trend.\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down from the moving averages once again, it is likely to slump to the support at $0.27795. The moving averages are flattening out and the RSI is marginally in the negative territory, which suggests consolidation in the near term. We will wait for a bullish setup to form before recommending a trade in the pair.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) bounced off the critical support at $116.3 on Jan. 14, but failed to break out of the 20-day EMA. It is currently stuck between both moving averages.\n\nA break out of the 20-day EMA can carry the price to $167.32, whereas a break down of the 50-day SMA and $116.3 can plunge it to $100, and below that to $83.\nThe 50-day SMA is flat, which shows that the ETH/USD pair might consolidate between $116.3 and $167.32 for a few days. A new uptrend can be expected if the price sustains above $167.32. We couldn\u2019t find any reliable buy setups yet, so we are not proposing any trades.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has been trading in a tight range since it broke down of the support at $141. While the bears have failed to sink it towards the next support at $100, the bulls have failed to push it back above $141.\n\nWe anticipate a decisive move within the next 3-4 days. If the bulls scale $141 and the moving averages, the BCH/USD pair can move up to $181. If this resistance is also scaled, the rally can extend to $239.\nNevertheless, if the price fails to scale the moving averages, the bears will try to push the virtual currency below $121.3, which can ultimately result in a drop to $100. We shall wait for buyers to return before recommending a trade.\nEOS/USD\nEOS is trading inside the range of $2.3093\u2013$3.2081. Currently, the bulls are facing resistance at the moving averages. If this resistance is scaled, a rally to the top of the range will be probable.\n\nThe EOS/USD pair will turn positive after the bulls sustain above the range. In such a case, a rally to $3.8723, and further to $4.493, will be probable.\nOn the other hand, if the bears push the price lower from the current levels and break below $2.1733, a fall to $1.7746 and $1.55 will be on the cards.\nWe might suggest long positions if the price sustains above the moving averages. Until then, we remain neutral on the cryptocurrency.\nXLM/USD\nThe intraday range in Stellar (XLM) has shrunk in the past two days. This period of smaller ranges is likely to be followed by a range expansion.\n\nA break out of the downtrend line of the symmetrical triangle can carry the XLM/USD pair to $0.13427050. Above this level, we anticipate a quick move to $0.184.\nHowever, if the bears plunge the price below $0.1, a retest of $0.09285498 will be likely. The downtrend will resume if this support gives way. We couldn\u2019t find any bullish patterns developing yet, so we suggest traders remain on the sidelines.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin (LTC) has been struggling to break out of the 20-day EMA for the past five days. A failure to climb above the moving average will attract selling that will test the immediate support at $29.349. A break below $27.701 will increase the chances of a retest of $23.1.\n\nThe combination of flat moving averages and the RSI close to the 50 levels is not pointing to a clear winner yet. The indicators show that there is a balance between the buyers and the sellers.\nNonetheless, if the bulls succeed in breaking out of the 20-day EMA, the LTC/USD pair can move up to $36.428. The zone between $36.428 and $40.784 is a major hurdle, above which, a quick jump to $47.246 is possible. Therefore, traders who hold long positions can keep their stops at $27.5.\nTRX/USD\nTron (TRX) is finding it difficult to break out of $0.02815521. On Jan. 15, it turned down from the area of the upper end of the range. If the price takes support at the 20-day EMA, the bulls will attempt to break out of the range again. The uptrending moving averages and the RSI show that the demand currently outweighs the supply.\n\nStill, if the bulls fail to scale the overhead resistance, a fall to 20-day EMA, followed by a drop to the critical support at $0.0183 is probable.\nThe next move will start after the TRX/USD pair breaks out or breaks down of the range. We suggest traders wait either for a break out of the range or for a bounce from the bottom of the range to initiate long positions. We couldn\u2019t find any buy setups at the current levels.\nBSV/USD\nBitcoin SV (BSV) has entered a period of low volatility, which shows a lack of interest from both the buyers and the sellers.\n\nThe BSV/USD pair will attract selling if it sinks below $74.022. The downward momentum will pick up if the bears break the support at $65.031.", "birthday": "2019-01-16T19:35:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-16 19:35:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 16}

Instead of increasing the interest of potential buyers, they get the opposite effect. The company believes its product can change the way buyers and sellers currently communicate by putting the prospective buyer in the center of the process.\nThe company says that the potential buyers are able to choose whether or not they want to see an ad on the WeBuy platform. They create a SellMe profile and specify the products or services they might want to buy.\nThe feature called \u201cSellMe\u201d enables sellers to localize potential buyers who have expressed interest in a seller's products. Users create a profile when they want to purchase something, and the information is then sent to WeBuy sellers. The sellers located in the buyer\u2019s geographical area will receive the SellMe profile of the potential buyer and can then reach out to them. The company can communicate with the potential buyers in real time.\nWith no commitment needed to actually buy the product, the buyers get rewarded in WBY tokens just for being contacted by the seller. The users are encouraged to create and manage their own Buyer Referral Network (BRN). The buyers invite stores to join the platform and, after accepting this invitation, the sellers join the BRN. Every time a seller pays for advertising on WeBuy, the user who invited this company will get a share of this payment.\nThe platform will be linked to the public Stellar network and the WeBuy blockchain. The sharing model is based on a smart contract. The users can verify their transactions by a cryptographic key.\nThe startup assures that users have full control of their privacy and the information about them is never revealed to the sellers or any third party.

A substantial portion of the stock \u2014 25.52 percent \u2014 is also held by a local software development and consultancy services called Intranel, while the rest of shares seem to be controlled by the co-founders\u2019 relatives and private investors.\nAs per Cryptopia\u2019s LinkedIn profile, the company has \u201cthe world\u2019s largest range of cryptocurrencies.\u201d Indeed, the exchange has more than 830 cryptocurrencies listed, according to CoinMarketCap, which makes it one of the chief platforms for altcoin trading.\nThe data obtained from Coingecko suggests that Cryptopia\u2019s peak trading volume this year occurred on Jan. 11, when it reached around $1,875,000. The crypto exchange reportedly has around 1.4 million registered users and is the largest crypto exchange in the country. In May 2017, Cryptopia launched NZed (NZDT), allegedly the first stablecoin tethered to the New Zealand dollar.\nThe incident was originally reported as \u201cunscheduled maintenance\u201d; the police are on the case\nThe episode can be traced back to Jan. 14, when Cryptopia published a series of short tweets regarding \u201cunscheduled maintenance.\u201d Interestingly, the platform issued somewhat similar updates in June 2018, causing concern among users, who later reported withdrawal difficulties.\nNevertheless, next day, on Jan. 15, Cryptopia officially announced that it was hacked the day before. According to the note shared by the platform, after finding out about the security breach, the exchange\u2019s staff freezed all operations to assess damages.\nThe exchange has also reportedly notified government agencies and authorities, including the New Zealand Police and High Tech Crimes Unit, who have opened an investigation into the matter and are reportedly treating the incident as a major crime. On Jan. 16, the police confirmed that they are investigating the case.\n\u201cThe inquiry is still in its very early stages and police are continuing to work with Cryptopia to establish what has happened and how.\u201d\nAccording to local media outlet Stuff, on Jan. 16, the police locked down Cryptopia\u2019s office in Christchurch while some of the staff remained inside. The authorities later reported that the exchange\u2019s staff are fully cooperating with the investigation team, but noted that media reports claiming that police \u201cstormed\u201d the building are \u201centirely incorrect.\u201d\nFurther, the authorities are reportedly establishing a dedicated investigation team, including \u201cspecialist police staff with expertise in this area.\" The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) has also been called in, according to Stuff.\nThe FMA spokesman cited in the article said the watchdog did not regulate Cryptopia or the cryptocurrencies listed there, \u201cbut those providing a financial service related to cryptocurrencies needed to register on the Financial Services Providers Register \u2014 which enabled customers to access an independent dispute resolution service.\u201d According to the regulator\u2019s website, New Zealand firms who provide a financial service related to cryptocurrencies need to comply with the \u201cfair dealing\u201d requirements in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013.\nThe stolen amount remains undisclosed; social media estimates $3 million to $13 million being taken\nWhile Cryptopia\u2019s website is still under maintenance as of press time, the exchange has not revealed which tokens have been stolen and to what extent, limiting its comment to state that the losses are \u201csignificant.\u201d The company has since stated that they will not be providing a comment due to the ongoing police investigation.\nHowever, the police are also yet to confirm the exact amount of stolen money. As per their press release issued on Jan.16:\n\u201cPolice are not yet in a position to say how much cryptocurrency is involved, other than it is a significant amount. A large team, including Canterbury CIB and specialist staff from the police High Tech Crime Unit, have been assigned to the case.\u201d\nWith both Cryptopia and the authorities being unable to reveal concrete details of the alleged hack, the community has taken the matter into its own hands. Social media users have pinpointed one of the hacker\u2019s alleged wallet addresses, highlighting large transaction numbers, as well as the timing of transfers, which reportedly occurred after the site went into maintenance mode.\nIf true, the criminals have stolen an abundance of ERC-20 tokens, including Dentacoin, Metal, Ormeus Coin, PowerLedger, Revain, Zap Token, TrueUSD, Centrality, InvestFeed, PILLAR, Golem, Jetcoin, Fabric Token, DALECOIN, Soniq, VOISE, SpankChain, Mothership and Oyster Pearl, among others.\n\u201cAt this stage I'd probably believe reports of $11 [million] + USD equivalent hack,\u201d Reddit user u/spronky writes, \u201cI wouldn't be surprised if all the ERC-20 tokens in Cryptopia's hot wallets were thieved [sic].\u201d\nAccording to another Reddit investigation, a total of $13,000 worth of cryptocurrencies could have been stolen from Cryptopia. User u/toldjahP has collected numerous wallet addresses affiliated with the alleged hackers and combined the transfers, which equalled the above mentioned figure. Similar addresses have been marked by Twitter community members as well. While some of those wallets appear to be empty as of press time, one of them holds as much as $3.6 million.\nCommunity is not rushing to call it a \u201chack\u201d", "birthday": "2019-01-17T20:08:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-17 20:08:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 17}

As a result, Resistance is seeking to address exorbitant energy consumption and the power imbalance within the mining community by offering a \u201cradical concept\u201d known as proof-of-research.\nKnown as PoR for short, proof-of-research enables anyone to donate their computing power to scientific research projects, meaning that the electricity consumed is devoted to performing mathematical equations that further our understanding on issues with a real-world impact. In an attempt to make cryptocurrencies more accessible, the public can get involved without any need for specialized graphics processing units (GPUs) or other niche pieces of hardware.\nAn eco-friendly alternative\nIn explaining why its solution is necessary, Resistance has cited recent research that was published in the journal Nature. The study revealed that activities connected with Bitcoin use up more energy in a year than the whole of Singapore. Meanwhile, the energy used to mine Ethereum is the equivalent of Costa Rica\u2019s annual usage.\nAs reported by Cointelegraph last November, scientists in the United States have also revealed that it takes three times more energy to mine a dollar\u2019s worth of Bitcoin than it does to extract a dollar\u2019s worth of gold \u2014 and in excess of four megajoules more than required to mine the amount of copper at the same market value.\nResistance acknowledges that there is value in the algorithms performed during proof-of-work (PoW) mining \u2014 as they help to keep networks like Bitcoin secure \u2014 but argues that this method is in dire need of an update.\nThe team said: \u201cToday, miners with regular computers can\u2019t even hope to compete for the block reward.

The critical issue was detected by smart contract audit firm ChainSecurity and reported in a blog post Jan. 15.\nAccording to the company\u2019s report, the Constantinople upgrade introduces cheaper gas cost (transaction fees) for some operations on the Ethereum network. As an unexpected side effect, this allegedly enables reentrancy attacks via the use of certain commands in ETH smart contracts.\nA reentrancy vulnerability allows a potential attacker to steal cryptocurrency from a smart contract on the network by repeatedly requesting funds from it while feeding it false data about the malicious actor\u2019s actual ETH balance.\nAfri Schoedon, the hard fork coordinator at Ethereum and release manager at blockchain infrastructure provider Parity Technologies, has confirmed on Reddit that the core developers of Ethereum are aware of the vulnerability.\nSchoedon explained that an all-core-dev call has been scheduled on Friday, Jan. 18, to decide on further steps in relation to the newly discovered loophole. According to him, the launch of Constantinople has been postponed until at least the next week:\n\u201cWe will decided (sic) further steps on Friday in the all-core-devs call.

Decenter also tagged the advertising platform\u2019s official account in the tweet, asking whether they had introduced any new policy changes.\nThe Google Ads account then replied, stating that cryptocurrency exchanges targeting the United States and Japan can be advertised on the platform, while targeting other countries could be the reason for the ad rejection. While Decenter is based in Belgrade, Serbia, it does not provide services as a crypto exchange.\nFurther, when the startup explained that they are a group of developers doing smart contract security audits, and that they were seeing an error message when trying to use \u201cethereum development services\u201d and \u201cethereum security audits\u201d as keywords, the official Google Ads account answered that they were not able to preemptively confirm that the \u201cEthereum\u201d keyword was eligible to trigger ads.\n\u201cWe'd recommend that you refer to the 'Cryptocurrencies' section of our policy on Financial products and services.\u201d\nIn the referred section of their policy, Google Ads states that \u201cdue to the complex and evolving nature of regulations related to cryptocurrencies and related products and services,\u201d the company only allows advertising mining-related services and cryptocurrencies exchanges. The latter is approved for promotion only in Japan and the U.S., however.\nThe Google Ads guide then explicitly mentions that ads for initial coin offerings (ICOs) and similar services, along with \u201cad destinations that aggregate or compare issuers of cryptocurrencies or related products\u201d \u2014 such as crypto trading signals \u2014 are prohibited.\nBlanket ban followed by relaxation: Brief introduction to the relationship between Google and crypto\nIn 2018, after a lengthy period without regulation, Google\u2019s politics regarding cryptocurrencies became significantly stricter. Specifically, on March 14, the search engine giant updated its financial services policy, announcing that it was going to ban all cryptocurrency-related advertising of all types come June.\nTo justify its crypto ad ban, Google said that it was protecting its customers from fraudulent offerings, including, but not limited to, \u201cinitial coin offerings, cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading advice.\u201d The company\u2019s executive, Scott Spender, told CNBC at the time:\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a crystal ball to know where the future is going to go with cryptocurrencies, but we\u2019ve seen enough consumer harm or potential for consumer harm that it\u2019s an area that we want to approach with extreme caution.\u201d\nThe move was later described as \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201ctroubling\u201d by industry insiders. Interestingly, the news of a crypto ad ban came just days after crypto advertisers using Google Adwords reportedly noticed a drastic drop in the number of views of their advertisements. However, as per Finance Magnates, Google Ads had, at that time, denied any change in their financial services regulations that would block cryptocurrency- or ICO-related advertisements.\nFurther, on Sep. 25, the U.S. tech giant partly backpedalled on its blanket ban of ads. Google announced it was set to update its ad policy in October, reallowing some crypto businesses to advertise on its platform.\nAccording to the official statement, starting in October, Google would allow registered crypto exchanges to advertise on its Google Adwords platform, targeting the U.S. and Japanese audiences:\n\u201cAdvertisers will need to be certified with Google for the specific country in which their ads will serve. Advertisers will be able to apply for certification once the policy launches in October.\u201d\nThe cryptocurrency section of the Google Ads\u2019 policy has since been updated, but the precise amount and nature of crypto businesses that have since been allowed to advertise there remains unknown.\nDecenter: \u201cEthereum\u201d keywords isn\u2019t working for other companies too, Google Ads is to provide a definite explanation within 48 hours\nAfter communicating with Google Ads over Twitter, Decenter took to Reddit to ask the r/Ethereum subreddit users about the alleged policy changes. In the post, the team specified that they have tested keywords for \u201cethereum smart contract audits\" and \"eos smart contract audits\u201d and found that only the EOS-referenced keyword showed ads.\nThe community largely reacted by criticizing Google\u2019s position as a neutral third party. The top comment reads:\n\u201cGoogle has various political and economic agendas, and they are quite willing to use their various services to promote their preferences. AdSense and YouTube are notorious for this, but there have been some incidents regarding the Play Store as well.\u201d\nOther users mostly cited the previous blanket ban and the abundance of scam projects as potential reasons for Google Ads to prohibit such advertisements. Some users reported having problems with other crypto-related keywords besides \u201cEthereum.\u201d \u201cI have been unable to use the 'bitcoin' (or even 'blockchain') on my google ads as well,\u201d one of the comments read.\nWhen reached by Cointelegraph, Decenter CEO Andrej Cvoro said that there are other startups which started having difficulties with the \u201cEthereum\u201d ad keyword this month:\n\u201cWe are aware of at least five different competitors that used to have Google Ads shown for search phrases such as \u2018Ethereum smart contract audit,\u2019 all of which stopped showing at the same time.\u201d\nWhen asked to clarify the names of the companies allegedly dealing with the same problem, Cvoro replied that he was not able to answer that \u201cwith certainty\u201d:\n\u201cAll we know is that there are other companies that used to have their ads displayed for search phrases such as \u2018Ethereum smart contract audits,\u2019 which is no longer the case. Due to the intricacies of Google Ads keyword setting mechanism, this does not necessarily mean that these companies had explicitly entered \u2018Ethereum\u2019 as one of their keywords, although there is a good chance that this is the case.\u201d\nThus, according to Cvoro, the ads are still showing for other crypto-related tags, but \u201cEthereum\u201d does not seem to be working \u2014 neither for those companies, nor for Decenter itself. That, the startup\u2019s CEO adds, suggests that Ethereum has indeed been blacklisted:", "birthday": "2019-01-15T16:34:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-15 16:34:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 15}

Cointelegraph Japan reported the news on Jan. 16, following comments from a BitMEX representative.\nIn detailed comments to CT Japan, BitMEX claimed there were as many as six major mistakes in the report, which was published on Jan. 15 by Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper South China Morning Post (SCMP).\nSCMP had reported that BitMEX was moving to bar traders from the Canadian province of Qu\u00e9bec after the local financial regulator, the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (AMF), had sent a letter in early 2018 citing its lack of registration in the province and declaring its activities there illegal.\nThe AMF reportedly told SCMP that all Quebecois BitMEX accounts had subsequently been closed.\nSCMP had further alleged that BitMEX was stepping up restrictions on U.S. accounts in light of escalating enforcement actions from the country\u2019s securities regulator. The report had claimed that while Asia accounts for the lion\u2019s share of BitMEX trading volumes, the U.S. had nonetheless been its other major market, according to unnamed insider sources.\nCiting other unnamed sources, SCMP estimated that until the very recent account closures, U.S. users had comprised around one-seventh of the exchange\u2019s total user base. The report went on to infer a correlation between these closures and recent declines in BitMEX\u2019s traded volumes over the past month, which have reportedly dropped by as much as 50 percent.\nBitMEX refuted these claims, telling CT Japan that the platform has \u201cbanned all US Traders since 2015 and has been proactively closing accounts since guidance was obtained by US regulators, in particular the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\u201d It added:\n\u201cBitMEX has always retained the right to close [accounts] where any BitMEX trading participant has given false representations as to their location or place of residence.

This indicates that the process of bottom formation will be volatile.\nThe traders should aim to book quick profits and trail their stops higher to protect any potential profits. The important event that turned the tide in favor of the bears was the 51 percent attack on the Ethereum Classic network.\nThe crypto markets had topped on Jan. 7, 2018, reaching a total market capitalization of over $835 billion. From there, most of the top cryptocurrencies reversed direction causing a huge erosion in wealth. Even after one year, we can not confirm that the markets have bottomed out and are now on the way up.\nHowever, in 2019 the prices could by boosted by any positive regulatory developments, Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval, or increased institutional interest. Until then, what should the traders do? Let\u2019s study the charts of the top 5 performers among the top coins to gauge the current sentiment.\nTRX/USD\nTron was the best performer in the past week, as it bucked the trend and stayed comfortably in the green. The company has acquired the peer-to-peer torrent client BitTorrent in August 2018. Last week, the latter has launched its own Tron-based cryptocurrency called BTT.\nJustin Sun, the founder of Tron, expects this move to increase the reach of blockchain to hundreds of millions of users. However, Simon Morris, former chief strategy officer at BitTorrent, has opined that the Tron blockchain does not have the capacity to manage the transaction volume needed to tokenize BitTorrent.\nIn other news, Tron has hired former SEC supervisory attorney David Labhart as its head of compliance. Will the performance of the digital currency continue for the next few days? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nThe TRX/USD pair has mostly been trading inside the range of $0.0183\u2013$0.02815521 since mid-August of last year. Although the bears had broken down of this range in mid-November, they could not capitalize on it.\nAfter trading close to $0.011 for about five weeks, the bulls staged a smart recovery that pushed the price above the resistance of the range at $0.02815521. However, the breakout was momentary, as sellers pounced at higher levels, dragging the price back into the range.\nWe anticipate a new uptrend if the price breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above $0.02815521. Currently, both moving averages are flat and the RSI is also close to 50 levels, which suggests that range bound action might continue for a few more days. Our view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price back below $0.0183. \u00a0\nShort-term traders can buy closer to the bottom of the range and sell near the top of the range. However, as the price action inside the range can be volatile, traders should keep their positions small.\nNEO/USD\nThe news of a rumored partnership between the Russian government and NEO developers has kept the cryptocurrency buoyed. The expectation is that in order to dodge the United States sanctions, the Russian government is attempting to diversify into cryptocurrencies.\nIf the rumor turns out to be completely false, the price might fall. So, what should the traders do?\n\nThe NEO/USD pair has a tendency to consolidate before breaking out or breaking down. The two previous attempts resulted in a breakdown of the range, followed by extended fall.\nCurrently, the cryptocurrency is again stuck in a range with support at $5.4808 and resistance in the $10\u2013$12 zone. Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is also close to the oversold zone. There are no signs of a reversal forming on the charts yet.\nThe previous consolidation had lasted for 13 weeks and the current one has so far been going on for seven weeks. We expect the price to remain stuck in the range for a few more weeks, before it breaks out or breaks down.\nWe suggest investors wait for a trend reversal to be signaled before initiating any long positions.\nADA/USD\nThe market participants are awaiting the release of Project Shelly that will help Cardano shift from a centralized platform to a decentralized one. Will this upgrade propel the digital currency higher in the near future? What should the traders do now?\n\nThe ADA/USD pair is in a downtrend. It continues to make lower highs and lower lows. Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is also in the negative territory. The previous two pullback attempts have been shallow, which points to a lack of buyers.\nA break of the recent low of $0.027237 will resume the downtrend. On the upside, a move above $0.1 will indicate strength. We suggest traders wait for a bullish pattern to form before buying.\nBNB/USD\nBinance has revealed plans to launch one new token every month of this year through Binance Launchpad, its exclusive token launch platform. Will this give a much needed boost to the struggling initial coin offering (ICO) market?\n\nThe BNB/USD pair has been trading inside the descending channel for the past few months. The bulls are struggling to break out of the resistance line of the channel. If the bears sink the price below $5.4666, a retest of the recent low at $4.1723848 is probable. If this support breaks, the fall can extend to the support line of the channel.\nOur neutral-to-bearish view will be invalidated if the pair breaks out of the channel. The pattern target of such a breakout is $15, with a minor resistance at $12. Therefore, investors can wait for a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above the channel to initiate long positions.\nIf the price remains stuck inside the channel, buying can be done close to the support line of the channel and profits can be booked closer to the resistance line of the channel.

In the aftermath, crypto exchange Coinbase noted that upwards of $1.1 million in crypto was double spent during the time of the deep blockchain reorganization. Coinbase and several other cryptocurrency exchanges temporarily paused deposits and withdrawals of the altcoin to prevent loss of funds. Crypto exchange Gate.io confirmed that the attack was carried out and promised refunds, stating that around 54,200 ETC in total (worth around $271,500 at the time) was transferred during the attack. However, Gate.io also reported later that $100,000 was returned to them with no explanation, prompting rumors of participation by a white hat hacker.\nCoinbase, Square Cash App Reported Bans Accounts of Social Media Platform Gab Founder\nThis week, the social media platform Gab announced that both Coinbase and the Square Cash app had banned the personal account of Andrew Torba, the founder of Gab. As reported earlier last year, Gab.com\u2019s business account on Coinbase had already allegedly been closed in December. The blocking of Torba\u2019s Square Cash account occurred after the reported Coinbase block, and also after Gab sent an email to its user base promoting both the Cash App and Bitcoin. Gab is a social media platform that promotes itself as a place for free speech, becoming in effect a draw for those blocked on other platforms for hate speech concerning right wing extremism.\n\nAddition of Monero Payment Option to Fortnite Merch Store Was Accidental\nThe CEO of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney, said this week that the addition of altcoin Monero (XMR) as a payment option for the Fortnite merchandise store was an accident. The store, called Retail Row, accidentally began accepting the altcoin on Jan. 5, according to tweets from developer Riccardo Spagni. Sweeney, denying the rumors, said this week that the addition of Monero was unintentional, and that staff have since removed the privacy-centered altcoin from the store\u2019s payment option. Sweeney also denied that Epic Games had partnered with crypto payment processor GloBee.\nAnalysts Say BTC Whale Activity Could Move Market as Dormant BTC Wallets Revive\nA number of long-dormant Bitcoin wallet have seen an uptick recently, Bloomberg reported this week, which could mean that major BTC whales might influence the crypto market. According to analysis from crypto analytics startup Flipside Crypto, several long-inactive BTC holders have begun to move their coins, meaning that wallets active over the past 30 days now hold about 60 percent of total BTC supply. Similar wallet movement preceded Bitcoin\u2019s major historical price volatility in both 2015 and 2017 \u2014 in the latter year, the coin surged to all-time price highs of $20,000.\nWinklevoss Twins Express Commitment to Bitcoin ETF During Reddit AMA\nCameron and Tyler Winklevoss doubled down on their commitment to getting a Bitcoin (BTC) ETF approved during a question and answer session on Reddit\u2019s Ask Me Anything (AMA) subreddit this week. The twins also showed support for specifically Bitcoin, referring to it as \u201cthe OG crypto\u201d and calling it \u201cthe winner in the long term.\u201d Tyler Winklevoss also underlined the importance of blockchain versus cryptocurrencies, noting that they need each other in order to exist.\n\nWinners and Losers\nThe cryptocurrency markets are holding steady at the end of the week, with Bitcoin trading at around $3,670, Ripple at around $0.33 and Ethereum at around $126.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-powered-prediction-platforms-governance-and-uses-beyond-gimmick-markets-death-pools", "title": " Blockchain-Powered Prediction Platforms: Governance and Uses Beyond Gimmick Markets & Death Pools ", "content": "The views expressed here are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily represent the views of Cointelegraph.com\nLike many other ICO success stories and subsequent leaders in their respective market segments, Augur, the preeminent platform for decentralized predictions, faces constant public scrutiny. The latest episode that drew public attention is the allegation, voiced by cryptocurrency hedge fund Tetras Capital partner Alex Sunnarborg, that a developer group behind the platform significantly overstates the volume of trades that Augur processes.\nWhile the real trade volume is an essential metric indispensable for understanding the scale and impact of a given project, it is still a quantitative, rather than qualitative measure. In this regard, a dispute around how much money is staked on Augur at a given moment of time is different from two major previous fracases, which sparked debates about fundamental aspects of decentralized prediction platforms\u2019 usage and governance. Those two episodes concerned the so-called \u201cgimmick markets,\u201d and, earlier, Augur\u2019s capacity to host death pools.\nTricky wagers\nWhen betting money on the outcome of future events, like with any other contract, the rule of thumb is to make sure that you get all the details straight. What exactly is the outcome that liquidates your futures contract at a win or loss? When exactly does it occur? In most cases, these conditions are straightforward enough to go without saying. After all, when you wager on Real Madrid beating Liverpool in the Champions League final, 90 or 120 minutes after the kickoff time, everyone knows who won. And if something goes wrong, you can always appeal to the bookmaker.\nThis is not quite the case, it appears, when predictions go decentralized. Once everyone can set up a market, the terms of some contracts may become vague \u2014 either due to amateur bookmakers\u2019 unintentional lack of phrasing precision or due to malice. And once the bets are in, users have no recourse if they suddenly realize that they were wagering on something different than the market is really about.\nThe latter likely describes the situation many people involved with the recent Augur political market have found themselves in. The question looked simple: \u201cWhich party will control the House after 2018 U.S. Midterm Election?\u201d Anticipating that Democrats will have flipped the House as a result of the midterms, 95 percent of the bettors wagered on them. Indeed, the \u201cblue wave\u201d that pundits predicted yielded the Democratic-majority House post-election. However, the important caveat is that the newly elected members were not to come in until January 3, 2019; as of the market closing date, Dec. 11, the House remained exactly the same as it was before the midterms \u2014 that is, Republican-controlled.\n\nThe Augur community went abuzz: Those who thought they were betting on the election outcome demanded that the market be called for Democrats, while others \u2014 including the alleged creator and designated reporter for the market \u2014 insisted that the idea was to measure the state of the House on Dec. 10, which, to be fair, could hardly be different from what it was on the day the market opened. In a Reddit post, the self-avowed creator made this clear by referring to the deal as a \u201cgimmick market\u201d and declared his or her intention to call it for Republicans.\nThe fact that more than $1.3 million were at stake rendered this conundrum perhaps the toughest test for Augur\u2019s on-chain governance system so far, and definitely made for the platform\u2019s biggest publicity crisis since the summer hype around assassination markets. Despite the fact that these two controversies look quite distinct on the face, they are manifestations of the same deficiencies intrinsic to the nature of decentralized prediction markets.\nMarkets for death\nIn an episode of the British techno-dystopian series Black Mirror entitled \u201cHated in the Nation,\u201d mysterious assassins begin to eliminate public figures, one by one, decided by whomever social media users post the most #deathto hashtags about. Once the bloodthirsty online mob realizes how the death pool works, they readily rush to bid on the next odious MP\u2019s or obnoxious rapper\u2019s demise in order to trigger the murder that mysterious assassins immediately carried out.\nAs Augur, a blockchain-powered \u2014 decentralized prediction market, went live in July 2018 \u2014 the media\u00a0was quick to latch onto the minor yet captivating facet of its functionality: the capacity to enable the creation of so-called \u201cassassination markets.\u201d In the dark spirit of Black Mirror, albeit under a somewhat different mechanism, these arrangements could spell death for those in the public eye. Indeed, it did not take long after the platform\u2019s launch for such markets to appear, with a number of prominent politicians, actors and entrepreneurs put on the spot.\nAugur provides a decentralized infrastructure for users to set up bets on whether certain events will or will not take place. Taking advantage of blockchain\u2019s anonymity and the absence of a centralized authority to censor the content on the platform, malicious users could potentially procure a tool for incentivizing other people to \u201chelp\u201d certain outcomes occur. For instance, by creating a market on whether politician X dies before the end of their incumbency and staking a huge pot of money on a \u201cno,\u201d someone could effectively put a bounty on the person\u2019s head. Wagering against the massive \u201cno\u201d market and then contributing \u2014 to put it gently \u2014 to a \u201cyes\u201d outcome, any villain could run off with the money.\nHorrendous as it sounds, the scenario was not invented by the Augur community. The idea of a cryptographically anonymized death market has been present in the cypherpunk milieu for a while \u2014 at least since cryptographer Jim Bell had formally recorded it in his 1996 essay \u201cAssassination Politics.\u201d He envisioned a market that would predict the deaths of government officials as a means to punish those who indulge in corruption. The Augur subreddit has also been rife with\u00a0various takes on the death market principle long before the protocol went live.\n\nLarger problem\nSo, is this what blockchain is for: letting scoundrels ease the remiss bettors of their money or even anonymously order people dead and get away with it? The clamor over the dubious Augur developments jibes quite well with the broader, ongoing debate that concerns platforms\u2019 responsibility for the content their users choose to publish on them. Think Facebook and fake news/streamed deaths, or Twitter and political botnets, or Youtube and videos of dead bodies on popular suicide sites. The centralized social media gatekeepers\u2019 mantra of \u201cwe are not publishers, we are merely infrastructure providers\u201d is sounding ever less convincing with each high-profile blunder, forcing corporations behind those platforms to haphazardly design new policies and interventions.\nCritics often point out that, in the case of a decentralized, blockchain-powered marketplace for anything, there is no corporation or government to go to if the goods or ideas in question turn out to be immoral or otherwise unacceptable for the majority of users. Furthermore, immutability of distributed ledgers that carry information about transactions renders it impossible to take the content down. This takes us back to a more general problem of blockchains\u2019 capacity to perpetuate the wrong \u2014 be it flawed land titles, unjust copyright claims or transferring a scam victim\u2019s money to a con artist\u2019s wallet. Does this mean that a responsible society should avoid using decentralized, permissionless systems to underpin any sensitive sphere of transactions? Not really.\nThe classic notion of the marketplace of ideas, as John Milton and J. S. Mill construed it, rests on the assumption that, once all ideas are allowed to clash freely in an open marketplace, the best of them will eventually prevail. Even though such reasoning might not seem indisputable, one need not take this leap of faith in order to be comfortable with blockchain-powered markets. Regardless of whether the natural tendency of good ideas to defeat bad ones is really a thing, there are still other mechanisms to fall back on \u2014 namely, governance systems\u2019 design and a broader set of social norms that govern human behavior.\nPrediction markets, as well as other blockchain-based idea marketplaces, may \u2014 and probably should \u2014 incorporate some on-chain mechanisms of community self-regulation. In the case of Augur, the community of REP token holders \u2014 who are also called \u201creporters\u201d \u2014 are incentivized by the system\u2019s design to document the correct outcomes of the events in question. The same people have the power to declare a certain bet \u201cinvalid,\u201d in which case nobody gets paid after the outcome is decided.\nThis instrument of community self-policing looks like a relevant tool for stopping morally reprehensible bets from enriching those who might want to use the platform for malicious ends. The \u201cgimmick market\u201d case is a great way to test the system\u2019s capacity to handle situations that are less unambiguously unacceptable than facilitating murder. Assassination pools constitute a marginal fraction of Augur\u2019s overall trade volume, with just a handful of transactions. In contrast, gimmick markets on high-profile, highly bettable events may well become a feature of the Augur landscape, should the community set a precedent that lets the first one be.\nIn addition to on-chain community governance, there are things happening off-chain, too, that may serve as checks to potential abuse of prediction markets\u2019 infrastructure. Even if we adopt the radical stance and accept that \u201ccode is law,\u201d there is a larger ecosystem of constraints that influences human behavior. In the words of Lawrence Lessig, one of the preeminent legal thinkers of the Internet age, there are at least four discrete forces that shape people\u2019s actions online: law, choice architecture, market and societal norms.\nEven if the distributed ledgers\u2019 architecture allows people to anonymously sponsor \u2014 and subscribe for \u2014 lawless action or con markets, and given the demand for them, social norms are still there. These norms suggest that murder is highly unethical, and fooling people into betting on the event that cannot possibly occur is not the best way to make them like you \u2014 even if you say sorry afterward. Also, there is a consideration of a perhaps more forceful effect: Both murder and fraud are criminal offences punishable within the legacy legal system, which still exerts a lot of influence over us all. On Augur, bets come in Ethereum, not REP, meaning that payments are very much traceable by law enforcement. And rest assured, the authorities are watching closely.\nRegulatory concerns\nMost certainly, Augur already has regulators\u2019 close attention, and recent developments are not going to make things better. Since markets that the platform hosts are essentially futures contracts, Augur and other decentralized prediction markets fall under the purview of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\nReports emerged last summer that the agency was scrutinizing Augur for\u00a0allegedly facilitating illicit gambling activities, since prediction markets as a form of gambling are illegal in the U.S. Those that manage to operate do so with multiple buffers and protections. For example, PredictIt, the largest non-blockchain platform that allows American citizens to wager on political events, is operated by a New Zealand-based, university-affiliated nonprofit and has strict limitations on the amount of money that users can stake.", "birthday": "2019-01-14T11:24:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-14 11:24:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 14}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nAfter the two years of price-centric action in the cryptocurrency industry, 2019 might shift the focus towards the fundamentals. Until the community puts an emphasis on the foundational aspects of crypto, we believe that a sustained recovery is unlikely.\nThe Winklevoss twins believe that stablecoins and tokenized securities will give a boost to the crypto space. Remaining positive on Bitcoin (BTC), they continue to hold the view that it is a better investment than gold.\nWhile the Winklevoss\u2019 view can be considered biased, as they have a vested interest in crypto prices going up, the arrival of established players into the asset class shows the promise it holds.\nVontobel bank, Switzerland\u2019s third largest financial custody provider, has launched a digital custody product for institutional players. Large players like Vontobel don\u2019t get into a space without studying it extensively. That leads us to believe that it is only a matter of time until institutional money starts trickling into the market.\nHowever, not all banks share Vontobel\u2019s point of view. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has cautioned investors that they could lose money on Bitcoin.\nAmidst these contradictory opinions, what do the charts suggest? Let\u2019s find out.\nBTC/USD\nAfter struggling to stay above $3,598 on Jan. 11 and 12, Bitcoin (BTC) broke below the support line on Jan 13. There is no support between the current level and $3,236.09. Hence, we anticipate a gradual slide to the lows if the bulls fail to sustain above $3,598. A break down of Dec.15 low will resume the downtrend.\nBelow $3,236.09, the next support is the psychological level of $3,000. The failure of the bears to defend the low confirms that the sellers are in command. A new low will be a serious sentiment breaker.\n\nOn the other hand, if the BTC/USD pair reverses direction from either the current levels or $3,236.09 and breaks out of the downtrend line and $4,255, it will be an indication of strength. We are yet to see the formation of a higher high and a higher low, which would confirm a trend change.\nCurrently, we remain neutral on the pair. Depending on the price action in the next couple of days, we shall suggest a course of action. Until then, the traders can stay on the sidelines.\nXRP/USD\nThe bulls have been unable to push Ripple (XRP) above $0.33108 in the past three days. Currently, the bulls are attempting to scale the level again. If this latest recovery attempt fails, we expect the cryptocurrency to drop to $0.27795.\n\nBoth moving averages are flattening out, and the RSI is in the negative zone. This increases the possibility of a range formation between $0.27795 and $0.4.\nThe XRP/USD pair is not signaling a trend reversal yet, so we suggest traders stay on the sidelines for a few more days.\nETH/USD\nEthereum (ETH) is attempting to bounce off the critical support at $116.3. If the rebound fails to scale the 20-day EMA, the bears will once again attempt to break down of $116.3. If this support gives way, a retest of the lows at $83 is probable.\n\nThe 20-day EMA has started to turn down, which shows that bears hold the advantage in the short term. However, the 50-day SMA is flat, which points to a likely consolidation in the medium term.\nIf the bulls sustain above the 20-day EMA, the ETH/USD pair might consolidate between $116.3 and $167.32 for a few days. We shall wait for a breakout above $167.32 before turning positive on the coin.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash (BCH) has been trading below the range for the past three days. The bulls have been unable to push the price back into the range, which indicates a lack of buyers at the current levels.\n\nThe next support on the downside is $100 and below that at $73.5. Both moving averages are gradually sloping down, and the RSI is in the negative zone. This shows that the sellers will pounce on any pullback to $147.\nOur negative view will be invalidated if the BCH/USD pair sustains above the moving averages. Currently, we can\u2019t find any buy setups, so we remain neutral on it.\nEOS/USD\nEOS broke below the support of the range on Jan. 13. The bulls are currently trying to push the price back into the $2.3093\u2013$3.2081 range. If successful, the consolidation might continue for a few more days.\n\nBoth moving averages have turned down, and the RSI is also in the negative area. This means that the bears are in command.\nIf the EOS/USD pair drops below $2.1733, a fall to $1.7746, and further to $1.55, will be likely. Conversely, if the cryptocurrency bounces from the current levels and scales above the moving averages, it might extend its stay in the range. We shall turn positive on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $3.2081.\nXLM/USD\nAfter the breakdown of the symmetrical triangle, Stellar (XLM) is attempting to stay above $0.1. If this support breaks, a retest of $0.09285498 is likely.\n\nBoth moving averages are trending down, and the RSI is in the negative zone, which shows that the bears have the upper hand.\nOur bearish view will be negated if the XLM/USD pair reverses direction and rises above $0.13427050. The traders can wait for a trend reversal pattern to form before initiating any long positions.\nLTC/USD\nThe bulls could not defend the moving averages, which points to a lack of demand. Litecoin (LTC) is currently attempting to bounce off the critical support of $29.349.\n\nThe strength of the bounce will signal whether the LTC/USD pair will move up or tumble below the support. If the bears break below $27.701, a fall to the low of $23.090 will be possible. Hence, traders who hold long positions should keep a stop loss at $27.5.\nIf the bulls bounce strongly and sustain above the moving averages, it will indicate demand at lower levels. In such a case, a rally to $40.784, followed by a move to $47.346 is probable.\nTRX/USD\nTron broke below the 20-day EMA on Jan. 13. Though the price quickly reclaimed the moving average, the bulls are facing selling at higher levels.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is flattening out, whereas the 50-day SMA is sloping up. This points to a consolidation in the near term but advantage to bulls in the medium term. The support on the downside is at the 50-day SMA, which is close to $0.0183.\nThe TRX/USD pair might stay inside the range $0.0183\u2013$0.02815521 for a few days, before breaking out of it. Our neutral-to-bullish view will be invalidated if the price plunges below $0.0183. Nevertheless, we couldn\u2019t find any reliable buy setups at the current levels, so we are not proposing a trade yet.\nBSV/USD\nAlthough the bears broke below the support of the range on Jan. 10, they could not push the price toward the next support of $65.031.\n\nFor the past three days, the bulls have been attempting to stay above $80.352, but are facing selling close to the moving averages.\nIf the BSV/USD pair breaks below $74.022, the next stop is $65.031. If this support also crumbles, a retest of $38.528 will be probable.", "birthday": "2019-01-14T21:55:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-14 21:55:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 14}

At that point, the 7,080,000 block will be extracted, and the Constantinople upgrade will be activated.\nall-core-devs call: constantinople upgrade for ethereum mainnet activation suggested for 16th of january 2019, block number to be confirmed on black friday in a fortnight\u2014 Afri \ud83c\udf29\ufe0f Jan 16 (@5chdn) November 9, 2018\n\n\nTo be on the safe side, the Ethereum Foundation also added an emergency switch that will delay the activation of Constantinople in case something goes wrong. Initially, the hard fork was planned for November 2018 but was postponed after Ethereum clients failed to reach a consensus during the launch, as reported by Cointelegraph on Oct. 15. While Ethereum developers are going over the final details, investors, miners and decentralized application (DApps) operators are discussing the fork\u2019s pros and cons, and analysts are forecasting Ether\u2019s price change.\nOnce again about Constantinople\nOriginally planned for November, the Constantinople hard fork contains a number of changes and code optimizations designed to turn the current Byzantium into a more progressive Constantinople. Most of the improvements are aimed at reducing the costs of work or simplifying the process of creating DApps. In particular, they include a 12-month delay of the so-called \u201cdifficulty bomb,\u201d which contributes to timely upgrades, and also suggests a decrease in the mining reward from 3 to 2 ETH for each mined block. Such changes are provided by the roadmap and are necessary for the gradual transition of the network to a proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm and further improvement of scaling.\n\nWhat turns Byzantium into Constantinople is five major Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs), which are needed to soften the transition from the current proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm to the more energy-efficient PoS algorithm.\nIn particular, the EIP 145 proposal will allow DApp developers to optimize particular operations, which will allow the reduction of gas costs necessary for work. EIP 1014 will provide an opportunity to interact with addresses that have not yet been initialized on the blockchain, EIP 1052 introduces new operational codes for generating address hashes. EIP 1283 includes new features that will also reduce gas costs, and EIP 1234 will delay the \u201cdifficulty bomb\u201d for 12 months and will reduce mining rewards.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nIn the future, the transition to a pure PoS (the Casper upgrade) will be made as part of the next phase of improvements to the Serenity code. Once the innovations are implemented, large holders of the third-largest cryptocurrency will join miners in the process of transaction validation. Such a scheme will reduce the likelihood of a 51 percent attack and increase the network\u2019s security, since such validators can lose investments in case of abuse. To make the network more technically stable, the size of the mining block reward will be reduced from 3 ETH to 2 ETH, and the announced launch of the so-called \"difficulty bomb,\"\u00a0which will gradually complicate the extraction of Ether and make it unprofitable (\u201cIce Age\u201d), will be postponed for a year.\nThe difficulty bomb is a gradual increase in the complexity of cryptocurrency mining, which makes mining unprofitable for the miners. This is necessary when switching from PoW to PoS.\nThe PoS consensus algorithm, in addition to improved security, will bring cheaper transactions and faster production of new blocks. Sharding will also become possible, which, together with the additional solutions of second layers like Plasma and Raiden, is supposed to significantly increase Ethereum\u2019s scalability.\nThe concept of sharding can be represented as the work of a client of torrents. The blockchain breaks up nodes and transactions into smaller independent components called shards and each has its own transaction history log that processes only its own transactions, thereby taking a load off of the network.\nScalability has been Ethereum's Achilles' heel, and after the implementation of these solutions, it will be hypothetically increased by thousands of times, which will make the platform suitable for widespread commercial use.\n9. Blockchains of the future with proof of stake and sharding will be thousands of times more efficient, and so the efficiency sacrifices of putting things on a chain will become more and more acceptable.\u2014 Vitalik Non-giver of Ether (@VitalikButerin) December 10, 2018\n\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s idea to achieve the same throughput capability as the Visa payment system, which handles 24,000 operations per second, is also planned for future upgrades. In its current state, the Ethereum network is able to process a maximum of 25 transactions per second (TPS), while many \u201cEthereum killers\u201d in this regard have stepped far forward. For example, EOS is able to manage 1,200 TPS and Tron can already handle 2,000 TPS. Ethereum developers hope that their blockchain will become more competitive, and, in addition to a large number of operations, will offer working smart contracts and tremendous experience in solving technical problems. Hudson Jameson, a developer relations officer at the Ethereum Foundation, expressed his expectations to Cointelegraph with respect to the Constantinople\u2019s main mission:\n\u201cThe Constantinople network upgrade paves the way for cheaper smart contracts for a variety of use cases, especially state channels that can help scale the network.\u201d\nNovelties from the developers\nOn Jan. 4, during a regular video call, Ethereum Foundation members discussed the introduction of the ProgPoW code, which is aimed at countering ASIC miners. Until the last moment, it hadn\u2019t been clear whether this new algorithm would be introduced in Constantinople. Things changed after the Ethereum developers meeting, during which the team decided to postpone the transition to ProgPoW until Istanbul, the subsequent network upgrade, as reported by Cointelegraph on Jan. 4.\nAmong other novelties being discussed by developers is the Ethereum 1x update, which implementation is scheduled for 2019. Several working groups shared their achievements, stressing that the decision was still at the earliest stages of development.\nThe list of innovations does not end there. Recently, new promising developments have appeared. Among them are solutions based on Snark (in which transaction data is converted into constant \u201ccompressed evidence\u201d), which will allow reaching a significant level of network bandwidth without using Plasma and Raiden. Furthermore, this technology will increase data privacy. Another possible evolutionary path could be Turbo Geth, which will reduce the amount of stored history of all network computing by 80 percent and increase its throughput.\nMeanwhile Parity Technologies is already preparing for the transition to Casper. Developers have added an additional version of Substrate, which was released on GitHub on Oct. 14 as an experiment. The code contains a mechanism of transition to the \u201cShasper\u201d upgrade, which combines the platform\u2019s in-house scaling solution, sharding, with its PoS consensus switch, Casper.\nNew coins expected, but not officially recognized\nDespite the fact that no new coins are expected during Constantinople, most of the major exchanges have already announced support for possible forks and airdrops. Poloniex, Bittrex, Huobi, Binance and OKEx warn users of the need to transfer funds to the exchange in advance to get possible coins, and projects supporting the fork are asked to contact for cooperation.\nBinance Will Support the Upcoming Ethereum Constantinople Hard Forkhttps://t.co/Jt91lT7hdY pic.twitter.com/OTr8fNOLr8\u2014 Binance (@binance) January 3, 2019\n\nUpdate: @BittrexExchange has completed the Ethereum (ETH) Constantinople hard fork upgrade scheduled for block 7,080,000.\u2014 Bittrex (@BittrexExchange) January 8, 2019\n\nThe news about the upcoming hard fork is being used by three projects at once to issue new coins. The founders of two of them, Ethereum Nowa (ETN) and Ethereum Classic Vision (ETCV), under the guise of forked ETH airdrops, are appropriating users\u2019 private keys. For this purpose, malware tools replicating official wallets are being used, as reported by Cointelegraph on Jan. 11, referring to Guarda Wallet development reports and users\u2019 complaints.\nA special thread has been created on BitcoinTalk forum, where users exposed the former. Apparently, the project used ShutterStock photos on its website to mislead users, who were promised to exchange 1 ETH for 1 ETN.\nThe website of the second one, Ethereum Classic Vision, appeared to appropriate private keys as well, as Guarda Wallet informed:\n\u201cThe analysis on the code performed by our team has shown that the piece of code provided actually sends your private key data on the Ethereum Classic Vision servers, masking it as an API token.\u201d\nOn Jan. 12 the project\u2019s website has been suspended and is unavailable at the moment. The ECV developers promised to implement the hard fork on Jan. 11, when users were supposed to get 3 ETCV coins for each 1 ETH they have.\nAnother project, ERC-20 Blue, has been spotted using the name of the Ethereum Foundation in Medium posts to mislead people. The account was deleted soon after being exposed.\nMeanwhile, users are being warned about possible scams:\nMany people are still confused about the upcoming #Ethereum upgrade. The #Constantinople hard fork is not contentious. Exchanges are announcing support for the upgrade NOT support for other forks. Be careful there are already scams around promising airdrops or free coins. $ETH\u2014 Alex Saunders (@AlexSaundersAU) January 6, 2019\n\nExpectations from the new Ethereum\nUsers expect that, with the release of Constantinople, the work of DApps will become simpler and more stable. Gas costs will be significantly reduced, and the technology itself will take another step toward scalability, which should increase 1,000 times in the final stage. This, in its turn, may mean a positive sign for blockchain projects and ICOs, according to Evan Luthra, an investor that Forbes included in its \u201c30 under 30\u201d list of entrepreneurs:\n\u201cConstantinople is being considered non-contentious, hence we can expect a major shift in the market to this new protocol. ICOs and airdrops will also benefit greatly with the lower costs. A lot of the ICOs I am advising are already talking about the benefits they will get for future airdrops and I am quite confident we will see more of the same.\u201d\nOnce Constantinople completes the Metropolis cycle, the interest of developers and investors in the Ethereum platform and decentralized projects will become even greater, according to Artem Popov, co-founder of Roobee, an investment platform for retail investors. He shared with Cointelegraph his thoughts on the possible influence of the upcoming upgrade on the investing industry and ICOs:\n\u201cMany associate Constantinople with a certain Rubicon during the transition of Ethereum from the PoW to PoS algorithms, which hundreds of thousands of ETH holders and crypto investors around the world have been waiting for. Ethereum holders will finally be able to earn ETH, simply by keeping it in their wallet and ensuring the operability of the network. All this can increase the number of ETH holders and reduce the number of sellers, thereby increasing the demand and price for Ethereum.\u201d\nHowever, the new ICO wave won\u2019t likely be seen immediately after the Constantinople release, as claimed by Popov:\n\u201cTo create it [the wave], we also need such factors as the overall growth in the capitalization of the cryptocurrency market, the successful development of projects that carried out ICOs in 2017-2018, positive regulatory changes in this area, etc.\u201d\nIn 2018, when the Ethereum blockchain saw an influx of active users and daily transactions \u2014 as was demonstrated by CryptoKitties \u2014 making it apparent that Ethereum\u2019s PoW consensus mechanism wouldn\u2019t stand the test of time.\nHowever, the final transition to PoS may be delayed, according to some users and analysts. \u00a0Ethereum\u2019s proponents may need to play the waiting game, as some of the project\u2019s skeptics are afraid that deadlines won\u2019t be met or will be postponed. The Block\u2019s Mike Dudas recently\u00a0claimed:\n\u201cEthereum is starting to remind me of the software vendor who never quite meets their deadline or quality promises.\u201d\nIn case developers will announce a long-term delay of the fork, the Ethereum price may be impacted significantly, according to Chris Matthews from Hacked:\n\u201cA short delay probably wouldn\u2019t have a major impact on price, but a delay of any meaningful length could lead to a selloff. Traders looking to initiate a short-term trade may want to make use of stop limit trades.\u201d\nAlex Kr\u00fcger, a cryptocurrency analyst, believes that the Constantinople upgrade will change the game for Ethereum.\n1/ #Ethereum's Constantinople fork is coming on block 7080000, around January 16, 2019. Constantinople will reduce the block rewards from 3 to 2, decreasing new $ETH supply accordingly.On the long run, this is decidedly bullish. https://t.co/4bbgAHMz7Z\u2014 Alex Kr\u00fcger \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 (@Crypto_Macro) December 24, 2018\n\nAccording to him, the 90 percent increase ETH experienced during the last month may be connected with the Constantinople hard fork. The ETH price spiked once the date for the upgrade release was announced, but later fell against the United States dollar.\n\nKr\u00fcger also suggests that other Ethereum upgrades had a different effect on the price of the coin. Thus, it can be difficult to predict what will happen after Constantinople is released. According to Kr\u00fcger, after the fork, Ethereum miners who spend more than $0.075 per unit on electricity will be operating at a loss in case the ETH price remains at about $155. However, there will still be those miners who may continue their activity even if this happens.\nArthur Hayes, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, hopes that ETH will revive when the ICO market comes back to life. Hayes believes that the ICO market will start to gain momentum once again in the near future and will have a great influence on ETH. He explained:\n\u201cThe use case for Ether is primarily ICOs. That market is dead right now. Once there are new issues, then Ether will rebound aggressively. When the ICO market returns, Ether will quickly test $200. The timing of the ICO rebirth is 12 to 18 months out.\u201d\nWhat if the fork fails?", "birthday": "2019-01-15T01:05:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-15 01:05:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 15}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nWhen a price is forming a bottom, it is usually volatile as both the bulls and the bears are trying to gain the upper hand. In a bear market, any negative news is met with strong selling and that is what has happened over the past two days. The 51 percent attack on Ethereum Classic has spooked the sentiment and dragged the prices lower.\nWhile the most recent fall shows that the sentiment is still fragile, a strong rebound from the current levels would indicate that there is demand on the dips, a markedly bullish sign. However, if the cryptocurrencies instead plummet to new lows, it would be a bearish sign.\nCEO and co-founder of Circle, Jeremy Allaire, believes that the lack of regulatory clarity from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the main hurdle facing the nascent asset class. According to him, cryptocurrencies will receive a boost when this issue is resolved.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin has turned down from the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern. If the price doesn\u2019t stop at the current levels, it can retest the low of $3,236.09.\n\nBoth moving averages are flat and the RSI is seeing support at the trendline. If the BTC/USD pair turns around from the current levels, it will again attempt to break out of the neckline. If successful, it will complete the bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern. The traders can wait for a breakout and close above $4,255 before buying.\nAnother possible scenario is that of a range formation for a few days. We might suggest new positions after the support and resistance levels of the range are well defined.\nXRP/USD\nRipple triggered our stop loss at $0.32 on Jan. 10. If the price doesn\u2019t turn around quickly from the current levels, the drop can extend to $0.27795.\n\nAfter staying flat for the past few days, the moving averages have started to turn down, and the RSI has also dipped into the negative territory. This suggests that the bears have the advantage. The XRP/USD pair might drop to the bottom of the descending channel. The traders should wait for a reversal pattern to form before initiating a trade in the pair.\nETH/USD\nAfter failing to break out of $167.32 for the past few days, Ethereum turned down on Jan. 10. It easily sliced through the 20-day EMA and is currently trying to hold the 50-day SMA.\n\nIf the bulls defend the 50-day SMA and the ETH/USD pair turns around, it will indicate strength. On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below $116.3, it can dip to $100 and below that to $83. The flat moving averages point to a consolidation in the near term.\nWe suggest traders wait for a clear range to be defined or for the price to scale $167.32 before buying.\nBCH/USD\nAfter consolidating for the past few days, Bitcoin Cash broke down of the range on Jan. 10. It can now drop to $100, which is a psychological support. If this level also breaks down, the price can plunge to $73.5.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is turning down after being flat for the past few days, which confirms that the sellers have an advantage in the short-term. The 50-day SMA is sloping down, which indicates that the long-term trend is down.\nIf the bulls push the BCH/USD pair back into the range, it will be the first indication of buying at the lows. We couldn\u2019t find any reliable buy setups, so we are not proposing a trade in it.\nEOS/USD\nThough EOS has declined to the bottom of the range, it is yet to break down of it. Currently, it remains range bound between $2.3093\u2013$3.2081.\n\nIf the EOS/USD pair plunges and closes (UTC time frame) below the range, it can retest the lows. Though there is a minor support at $2.1733, we expect it to be broken.\nHowever, if the support of the range holds, the consolidation is likely to continue. The longer the consolidation, the stronger the breakout. Therefore, we suggest traders buy on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $3.2081. Until then, we remain neutral on the cryptocurrency.\nXLM/USD\nStellar broke down of the symmetrical triangle on Jan. 10. It can now retest the low of $0.09285498.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is turning down after remaining flat for the past few days. This shows that the bears again have the upper hand in the short term. The 50-day SMA continues to slope down, which suggests that the long-term trend is still down.\nA breakdown of the Dec.15 low will resume the downtrend. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the XLM/USD pair reverses direction and breaks out of $0.13427050.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin has dipped back below the neckline after failing to rally in the past few days. If the price sustains below the neckline for two more days, it will confirm that the recent break out of the inverse head and shoulders pattern was a fake move.\n\nOn the downside, if the $29.349 support breaks, the probability of a drop to $23.1 increases. Hence, the traders who have long positions should keep their stops at $27.5.\nIf the LTC/USD pair bounces off either the 20-day EMA, or the 50-day SMA, it will attempt to break out of $36.428 and rally towards $47.246. However, the flattening moving averages and the RSI near 50 levels point to a consolidation in the near term.\nTRX/USD\nWe had expected TRON to reach a high of $0.03801042 but it turned down from $0.03575668. Therefore, we always suggest trailing the stops higher, to lock in the profits.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is still rising, hence, it might act as a strong support. If this support breaks, it can slide to $0.0183.\nIf the TRX/USD pair bounces off the 20-day EMA and rises again above $0.02815521, it can rally to $0.03801042. The traders can wait to enter new positions once again.\nBSV/USD\nThe tight consolidation has resolved to the downside. The breakdown below $80.352 is likely to push the price to the immediate support of $65.031. If this support also breaks, a retest of the lows is probable.", "birthday": "2019-01-11T20:46:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-11 20:46:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 11}

While the political action does not mention cryptocurrencies, it seems that such a run on the banks could hypothetically affect the crypto market \u2014 and vice versa.\nWhat\u2019s a bank run?\nA bank run entails a lot of people withdrawing their money from a given bank. It normally happens when investors start to feel that their bank may cease to operate in the near future.\nAs a result, a fractional-reserve banking system \u2014 in which banks keep part of their assets locally, usually at least equal to a fraction of their deposit liabilities \u2014 becomes challenged, while people start opting for other assets instead of fiat: for instance, bonds, precious metals or, theoretically, cryptocurrencies, as their decentralized structure might guarantee more independence from financial institutions.\nThere have been numerous bank runs throughout history, namely during the Great Depression and the 2007-08 financial crisis. However, according to academic research on bank runs, they tend to occur naturally due to panic and rumors among depositors rather than voluntarily, which makes it harder to assess the potential effectiveness of the Yellow Vests\u2019 plan.\nBrief introduction to the Yellow Vests movement and their bank run plan\nThe Yellow Vests movement started in November 2018, when various posts on social media suggested blocking roads and using yellow, high-visibility vests as a symbol of solidarity and support (hence the name). Mass protests across mainland France followed, with the immediate cause being the carbon taxes on petrol and diesel introduced by the French President Emmanuel Macron. Consequently, the activists have demanded lower fuel taxes, the reintroduction of the solidarity tax on wealth, a higher minimum wage and Macron's resignation.\nAnother crucial point for the Yellow Vest movement is the R\u00e9f\u00e9rendum d'initiative Citoyenne (Citizens Initiative Referendum \u2013 RIC), the proposal for a popular referendum in which citizens could propose and repeal laws, amend the constitution or remove an elected representative. Essentially, it is a form of direct democracy akin to the one employed in Switzerland.\nOver a few weeks, the protestors caused the French government to put its plans for fuel taxes and increased electricity tariffs on hold. Moreover, Macron has since introduced more measures to restore peace: namely, a minimum wage increase, a U-turn on a planned tax increase for low-income pensioners, and tax-free overtime payments and end-of-year bonuses. Nevertheless, the protests are still ongoing. The latest series of demonstrations, dubbed \u201cAct VIII,\u201d brought even more skirmishes onto the streets of France on Jan. 5.\n\u201cAct IX,\u201d in turn, is scheduled for next Saturday, Jan. 12. And, according to some posts on social media, it is going to be accompanied by a bank run on top of more traditional demonstrations. Thus, speaking in a video uploaded to Facebook on Jan. 7, an activist named Tahz San says:\n\"For Act IX, we will scare this state legally and without any violence [...] through the R\u00e9f\u00e9rendum des percepteurs [Collectors' Referendum]. [...] We all know that the power of a country is not in the hands of the government but in those of the banks. If the banks weaken, the state weakens immediately. [...] On Saturday, at 8 a.m. we will all vote by withdrawing our money [...] till the RIC won\u2019t imposed.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t matter the sum that will be withdrawn, and it is advised either to spend it at some artisan local shop or save at home \u201cunder mattresses, as did our grandparents,\u201d according to San. In case of failure, the operation should be reproduced the following month.\nThe very same idea was soon voiced by Maxime Nicolle, also known as \"Fly Rider,\" a popular spokesperson for the grassroots movement. \"Many people will withdraw their money from banks. Many, many, many,\" he said while discussing the so-called \u201cTax Collectors\u2019 Referendum\u201d in a live broadcast on Facebook. \u201cWe are going to get our bread back. [...] You\u2019re making money with our dough, and we\u2019re fed up.\u201d The video has since amassed around 1 million views.\nTherefore, the bank run\u2019s advocates hope to force the French government to meet their demands through a nonviolent way. In other words, the Tax Collectors\u2019 Referendum could be compared to the recent Proof of Keys event organized by entrepreneur Trace Mayer among members of crypto community. Timed to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the Bitcoin genesis block, the event aimed to motivate Bitcoin users to remove all coins stored with trusted third parties and take back control of their private keys.\nHow popular is Bitcoin in France?\nThe extent to which the demonstrators appear to support cryptocurrencies has not been measured, but some photos of an alleged protestor wearing a yellow vest saying \u201cbuy bitcoin\u201d on the back has gone viral among crypto-oriented blogs. Additionally, similar vests are currently being sold on Amazon.\n\nImage source: Twitter, @ydemombynes\nMoreover, for the 10th anniversary of the Bitcoin genesis block, French graffiti artist Pascal Boyart unveiled his wall mural titled \u201cLa libert\u00e9 guidant le peuple 2019,\u201d based on Eugene Delacroix\u2019s famous painting of the French Revolution, but featuring people in yellow vests. According to Boyart, he hid more than $1,000 worth of BTC in it. The wallet address of the prize is public, with entrepreneur Alistair Milne encouraging Bitcoin users to donate to the project to further increase the size of the treasure.\n\nImage source: www.pboy-art.com\nThere are more definite signs that Bitcoin is enjoying mainstream recognition in France, however. In November 2018, the local tobacco federation (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Buralistes) obtained permission to sell Bitcoin (BTC) at tobacco shops starting from January 2019.\nIn a deal with French cryptocurrency wallet provider KeplerK, up to 4,000 small shops will sell Bitcoin vouchers in denominations of 50, 100 and 250 euros, which customers can then exchange for cryptocurrency on KeplerK\u2019s website when they open a wallet.\nHowever, in response to the news about the crypto-friendly license, the French stock market regulator, the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (Financial Markets Regulator), jointly issued a warning with the country\u2019s central bank and French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (ACPR) recalling the risks associated with \u201cspeculative\u201d crypto assets.\nInterestingly, a privately owned French radio network, Europe 1, insisted that the ACPR had \u201cno choice\u201d but to approve the sales due to the rate at which cryptocurrency was entering mainstream consumer consciousness. Despite the uncertainty, several tobacco shops in Paris have reportedly already started selling Bitcoin for fiat.\nOverall, France has delivered mixed messages on cryptocurrency at the state level, mostly calling for international regulatory efforts. On the other hand, the head of French government\u2019s cryptocurrency working group, Jean-Pierre Landau, has argued that over regulation would deliver a \u201cthree-pronged danger.\u201d\n\u201cThe danger is three-pronged: that of freezing the rapid evolution of technology in legislation, that of failing to grasp the real nature of the object we intend to regulate and that of pushing innovation towards regulatory avoidance. On the contrary, regulation should be technologically neutral, and in order to become so, address the actors and not the products themselves.\u201d\nSo is the bank run likely to succeed, and what could it mean for crypto?\nAs the French magazine Capital states, the potential disruptive element of the upcoming bank run could technically be considerable: When banks start to collapse due to their inability to cover the costs of operating, the whole sector is likely to fail altogether. However, it also highlights the voluntary nature of the Yellow Vests\u2019 bank run, noting that the eventual turnout is likely to be low enough so as to not initiate a crisis.\nCapital also notes that the average amount withdrawn each day in France is 342 million euros, while around 126,000 people marched in France in support of Yellow Vests on Dec. 8. Consequently, at least 100,000 of them would have to withdraw around 3,400 euros to reach such an amount. Additionally, there are daily withdrawal limits tapped between 300 and 500 euros on debit cards for regular users, which would make the whole process more complicated.", "birthday": "2019-01-12T00:32:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-12 00:32:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 12}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/cornered-by-bear-market-bitmain-is-facing-an-unclear-future", "title": " Cornered by Bear Market, Bitmain Is Facing an Unclear Future ", "content": "This article was updated on Jan. 14 to include recent developments.\nOn Jan. 10, news emerged that Chinese Bitcoin mining giant Bitmain\u2019s co-founders, Jihan Wu\u00a0and Micree Zhan Ketuan, will step down as co-CEOs of the company. The move follows a streak of reports suggesting that Bitmain has been facing mass layoffs, class action lawsuits and difficulties related to its initial public offering (IPO) during the last quarter of 2018. So what exactly is happening with one of the world\u2019s most influential crypto outfits?\nBrief introduction to Bitmain, the world\u2019s most powerful crypto mining giant\nBitmain was founded in 2013 by Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan Ketuan. Prior to that, Wu was a private equity fund manager who studied economics and psychology at Peking University, while Zhan, a graduate of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was trying to raise funds for a startup that allowed users to stream television shows to a computer screen via a set-top box.\nAfter discovering Bitcoin (BTC) in early 2011, Wu allegedly spent all his life savings to buy the cryptocurrency. When the Bitcoin\u2019s price soared in 2013, he decided not only to trade the digital asset, but to create it as well. Wu asked Zhan to join him, and together they began developing an ASIC chip that would mine BTC at maximum efficiency. In November 2013, Zhan, the duo\u2019s technical mastermind, presented their first mining rig, the Antminer S1, and Bitmain\u2019s sales took off.\nAccording to Wu, the company experienced a difficult period close to the end of 2014, when the infamous Mt.Gox crash happened and the whole crypto market collapsed. The situation eventually stabilized when BTC\u2019s price began climbing up again the next year. Consequently, when the 2017 crypto boom kicked in, the business became extremely lucrative.\nThus, Bitmain booked $2.5 billion of revenue in 2017 alone, as Wu told Bloomberg, while this year turned out to be even more profitable: According to the company\u2019s prospectus, its revenue was set at $2.8 billion by the end of June 2018. According to a different report issued by investment research company Bernstein, Bitmain made between $3 billion and $4 billion in operating profit in 2017 and allegedly outraced Nvidia, which made about $3 billion during the same period.\nIn May 2018, Bitmain announced its expansion to the area of artificial intelligence (AI), where it planned to compete against Nvidia, Intel and AMD using its existing chip designs to power AI systems and software. The plan was disclosed against the backdrop of increasing scrutiny regarding crypto mining operations in China. \u201cAs a China company,\u201d said Wu, \u201cwe have to be prepared.\u201d He added that Bitmain plans to start earning as much as 40 percent of its revenue from AI chips within five years.\nSales of Bitmain\u2019s mining chips and circuits reportedly account for around 70 to 80 percent of the whole market. As per the company\u2019s LinkedIn page, Bitmain is currently headquartered in Beijing and employs around 2,500 people across the world. However, it is unclear whether this information is up to date, considering the recent reports regarding job cuts.\nCurrent state of affairs: Bear market-induced losses\nAs of January 2019, the two mining pools operated by Bitmain, AntPool and BTC.com, contribute to almost 23 percent of the total hashing power of the entire Bitcoin mining pool. However, just six months ago, the company\u2019s mining pools represented 41 percent of the market share, meaning that its share has been steadily declining. Indeed, the bear market has been taking its toll, and 2018 turned out to be a problematic year for the mining giant.\nAccording to a BitMEX Research report released on Aug. 30, Bitmain sold a lot of its mining units at a loss throughout 2018. The paper suggested that it was a deliberate strategy \u201cto squeeze out [Bitmain\u2019s] competition by causing them to experience lower sales and therefore financial difficulties\u201d:\n\u201cThis analysis implies Bitmain are currently loss-making, with a negative profit margin of 11.6% for the main S9 product and a margin of over negative 100% on the L3 product. In reality costs are likely to have declined so the situation may not be as bad, however we think it is likely Bitmain are currently making significant losses.\u201d\nAs previously noted by Cointelegraph, at the time the BitMEX research was published, the price of Bitcoin was hovering around $7,000, which was still above the breakeven cost of mining. Therefore, the demand was likely to be there, which would make the Bitmain\u2019s price war justified. However, when the full-blown bear market hit in November, and the price of Bitcoin fell below the breakeven cost of mining of $6,900, Bitmain should have started to experience harsher financial difficulties due to lesser demand for mining devices.\nBitmain staff cuts: From Israel division to CEO position\nOne of the most evident signs that Bitmain\u2019s business has taken a hit are the reported layoffs. On Dec. 26, Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post (SCMP) quoted Bitmain\u2019s alleged statement regarding internal job cuts. The announcement reportedly read:\n\u201cA part of [building a sustainable business] is having to really focus on things that are core to that mission and not things that are auxiliary. As we move into the new year we will continue to double down on hiring the best talent from a diverse range of backgrounds.\u201d\nAs SCMP noted, the exact number of layoffs had not been disclosed, but a spokesperson for the firm reportedly denied that Bitmain would lay off over half of its employees, a suggestion first circulated in Chinese social media.\nPreviously, on Dec. 23, Blockstream\u2019s chief security officer, Samson Mow, stated that Bitmain fired its entire staff of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) developers, citing Chinese social media. The developers had formed Bitmain\u2019s Copernicus team and were working on the company\u2019s Bitcoin Cash GO client. \u201cOnly 1 week notice. Some had just joined the company,\u201d Mow specified.\nOn Dec. 10, Israeli business news outlet Globes reported that Bitmain was closing its local development center and firing its employees. Dubbed Bitmaintech Israel, it was founded in 2016 to explore the use of blockchain, work on the Connect BTC mining pool, and develop the infrastructure behind Bitmain\u2019s AI project titled \u201cSophon.\u201d All 23 employees were fired, along with Gadi Glikberg, head of the Israeli branch as well as Bitmain\u2019s vice president of international sales and marketing. Glikberg linked the layoffs to the crypto market collapse:\n\u201cThe crypto market has undergone a shake-up in the past few months, which has forced Bitmain to examine its various activities around the globe and to refocus its business in accordance with the current situation.\"\nJanuary developments\nBitmain\u2019s austerity measures continued in 2019, suggesting that the company is indeed off to a bad start this year. On Jan. 10, Texas Public Radio announced that the Chinese company had suspended its operations in Rockdale, Texas. The firm was going to build a $500 million blockchain data center and mining facility in the state as part of its expansion into the United States market.\nOriginally, as per the publication, Steve Young, a Milam County judge, issued a statement reporting that all Bitmain employees but two engineers and the director of human relations had been fired, and all operations had been halted.\nYoung was then allegedly approached by the Chinese company\u2019s representatives, who told him that Bitmain will scale down the operation rather than shut it down entirely, now working with only five employees instead of 15. While Bitmain reportedly declined to comment on the issue for Texas Public Radio, the article cites their alleged statement shared with Young:\n\u201cThe right-sized team at Rockdale now has the expertise to re-start the project at small scale anytime. Bitmain would like to ramp up the site at a slower pace and scale based on market conditions.\u201d\nThen, on Jan. 14, Bitmain announced it was closing yet another office, reducing its overseas operations even further. The mining giant shared a statement, where it cited its long-term scalable business strategy as a primary reason to shut down its operation in the Netherlands.\n\u201cAs we build a long-term, sustainable and scalable business, we are making adjustments to our staff and operations. This includes the decision to close our Amsterdam and Israel offices. [...] We are really focusing on things that are core to our mission and not things that are auxiliary.\u201d\nFinally, according to a series of yet-to-be-finally-confirmed reports, changes occurred even at the senior level of the mining giant. Thus, on Jan. 10, SCMP wrote that both Bitmain\u2019s co-founders, Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan Ketuan, will quit their posts as co-CEOs, but still steer the company\u2019s important decisions.

At the beginning of the year, Litecoin founder Charlie Lee had a number impersonators setting up accounts on Twitter, promoting fake LTC giveaways.\nTelegram founder Pavel Durov was also a victim, as a number of accounts looked to take advantage of some downtime of the Telegram app, setting up fake accounts offering crypto giveaways for their support.\nSim-swapping whiz kid nabbed\n19-year-old Xzavyer Narvaez made headlines in August, after he was identified as the perpetrator of an elaborate sim-swap heist that saw more than $1 million worth of BTC stolen.\nAccording to reports, the teen stole phone numbers and used them to gain access to the social media and financial accounts of his victims. He would do this by performing a \u201csim-swap\u201d in order to take control of accounts on his own devices.\nInvestigators allege that Narvaez's Bittrex crypto wallet had received over 157 BTC between March and June 2018.\nNarvaez faces charges on four counts of using personal identifying information without authorization; four counts of altering and damaging computer data with intent to defraud or obtain money, and grand theft of personal property of a value over $950,000, according to court documents.\nIf not for his flashy spending of his ill-gotten gains, which included the purchase of a McLaren sports car, and his brazen use of the same device to process over 20 sim-swaps, Narvaez may have gotten away with his crimes.\nThe purchase of the $200,000 vehicle, which was made using BitPay, also helped authorities build a case against Narvaez.\nNarvaez is not the only perpetrator to be arrested for stealing large amounts of crypto through the use of sim-swaps.\nAccording to Krebs On Security, police arrested a man in August believed to be part of a cross-state syndicate involving nine suspects that used sim-swapping to steal large amounts of cryptocurrencies from his victims.\nVietnamese investors swindled by iFan, Pincoin\nIn April 2018, news broke of a massive ICO scam that had affected 32,000 investors in Vietnam.\nThe fraud was touted as one of the biggest to affect the crypto community, as $660 million of investors\u2019 money had been stolen by two separate ICOs, run by a parent company in Ho Chi Minh City.\nModern Tech operated two projects, iFan and Pincoin, which duped investors before they could alert authorities. The owners liquidated the company and vacated their offices in the city by the time affected investors lobbied to get their money back.\niFan was touted as a social networking platform for celebrities to promote content and merchandise to fans around the world.\nModern Tech was promising users in Vietnam 48 percent returns monthly for iFan tokens, but they had to make an initial investment of $1,000. Furthermore, users were given an 8 percent commission for referring new investors.\nPincoin, an ERC-20 token powering the PIN project, promised users up to 40 percent monthly return on investments on the landing page of the website. The project promised to build an online platform powered by cryptocurrency and blockchain to provide an advertising network, auction and investment portal, and peer-to-peer (p2p) marketplace, among other offerings.\nGAW, Paycoin Ponzi operator jailed\nAfter a protracted legal battle, Homero Joshua Garza, the CEO of now defunct GAW miners and Paycoin cloud mining, was sentenced to 21 months in jail in September 2018. His offences date back to 2015, when he was found guilty of running Ponzi schemes.\nBoth projects were setup that year, but within months, GAW was accused of being a Ponzi scheme, leading to its closure in 2015.\nThe developers of GAW also created Paycoin, a cloud-mined cryptocurrency.\nTaiwanese scam outed by Finnish investor\nIn August 2018, Taiwanese authorities acted on information $24 million crypto scam that had taken advantage of wealthy offshore investors.\nThai citizen Prinya Jaravijit was detained in August by authorities, suspected as the main culprit in the investment scam targeting Finnish investor Aarni Otava Saarimaa and his Thai business partner Chonnikan Kaewkasee.\nThe pair had alerted authorities after they'd failed to receive dividends from investments made with Jaravijit and nine other suspects.\nThe investors believed that their $24 million would be pumped into the casino- and gambling-focused cryptocurrency Dragon Coin (DRG). After parting ways with the funds, the pair never received any dividends from the so-called investment, a proof of investment in DRG, nor were they invited to shareholders meetings.\nThe case gained international attention when Jinya's younger brother, Jiratpisit \u201cBoom\u201d Jaravijit, a well-known soap-opera actor, was detained in August.", "birthday": "2019-01-09T13:51:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-09 13:51:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 9}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-is-boosting-the-health-sector-by-unifying-patient-data-and-increasing-funding-for-medical-research", "title": " Blockchain is Boosting the Health Sector by Unifying Patient Data and Increasing Funding for Medical Research ", "content": "People are living longer in the 21st Century, but what's less recognized is that, despite our increasing longevity, we're also getting sicker. According to research, the number of people over 65 afflicted with at least four medical conditions is on course to rise by 100 percent by 2035. As can be imagined, such a jump in illness is going to place an increasingly heavy burden on medical institutions and services, with the implication being that we \u2014 as a global community \u2014 need to find new, innovative ways of dealing with disease.\nFortunately, crypto is on hand to help with this emerging crisis. It won't be a panacea for the ills of our struggling health systems, but in a number of important ways, blockchains and cryptocurrencies could help the health sector meet its growing workload in the years and decades to come. By increasing the security and transparency of medical data, they could give patients greater assurance that their personal info is being protected, which in turn could increase trust in medical institutions and make people likelier to put their lives in the hands of health professionals. And by providing medical research companies with greater access to funding, they would accelerate progress in the area of drug treatment discovery, thereby saving lives and reducing sickness.\nHowever, the application of blockchain tech in the health industry won't be an entirely seamless process, given the need for effective crypto regulation to be established first, and given the fact that most blockchains still need to overcome various technical challenges before they can serve thousands \u2014 if not millions \u2014 of patients. But once it has met such challenges, those working in the space believe it will make a radical difference.\nData efficiency\nThe first and most important thing to observe about the growing use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in health care is that it's not mainly concerned with the actual process of treatment but rather with how data arising from treatment is processed and stored.\nIn early November 2018, Myongji Hospital in South Korea became one of the latest institutions globally to look to DLT, after it\u00a0announced that it would be working in concert with Korean IT company BICube to develop a blockchain-based data exchange system. As the press release\u00a0explained, this system would be part-private and part-public, enabling patients to approve the transfer of their medical data from one health institution to another.\nOther recently announced systems are set to work in much the same way, although with minor differences in each specific case. In Austria, the national government\u00a0offered its financial support to Lancor Scientific, which is building a cancer-screening tool that harnesses artificial intelligence (AI) that has a 90 percent accuracy rate of detection (human pathologists achieve only 60-70 percent accuracy for cervical cancer). In addition to using AI, Lancor will also be using its own proprietary blockchain to store the data obtained from its screening tool. And as its\u00a0white paper makes clear, a patient can access this data by using the platform's Medici Token, which activates the smart contracts that then release the relevant data to him or her (or to an approved third party).\nAccording to Lancor CEO Aamir Butt, blockchain technology will be applied mostly to medical data, but this will still enable health professionals and institutions to target treatment more effectively. He told Cointelegraph:\n\"Blockchain technology allows for better targeting of at-risk groups for cancer screening, because the data available is better. Patients own their own healthcare data when blockchain technology is used so the data has greatly more integrity than can be achieved in other models of data handling. For example, between 5% and 20% of NHS data is not tied specifically to a patient, and in the US, healthcare data is tied to a patient-event rather than a patient.\"\nIn fact, other platforms have been launched that aim to harness blockchain's power to integrate masses of data and make information quickly accessible, doing so in a way that improves the actual process of treatment \u2014 and often more cheaply. One such platform is Skychain, which is\u00a0combining DLT and AI to build a distributed network of artificial neural networks (i.e., artificial brains) that will potentially diagnose medical conditions with greater success than human practitioners. Similarly, Doc.com (also known as Docademic) provides users of its mobile app with access to doctors and medical professionals from around the world. Its CEO, Charles Nader, told Cointelegraph that its use of cryptocurrency will incentivize more potential users (patients and professionals) to engage with the platform, which will ultimately create more useful data.\n\u201c[Blockchain] certainly adds value since you have economic incentives to add more data as well as having access to information in one place. This incentive to add the data would be the cryptocurrency that interacts with the blockchain. And as more data is inputted into the blockchain, the information will be much more useful.\u201d\nNot only does blockchain provide incentives to add more data to health care systems, but it will actually incentivize people to show up to their appointments. Healthereum is another company building a blockchain-based platform that will enable patients to be treated by doctors from around the world, yet in contrast to many of its rivals, it will actually reward patients with its token for showing up to appointments \u2014 and punish them for not showing up. And as its CEO and founder, Steve Y. Chung, explains to Cointelegraph, this will go a long way in solving one of the health care industry\u2019s biggest problems.\n\u201cNo-shows afflict healthcare providers in every country. No-shows interrupt the relationship which then disrupts downstream health care. Utilizing blockchain, [we] address this very issue of no-shows via gamification of the appointment. Healthereum incentivizes adherence to appointments which then leads to better health.\u201d\nSecurity?\nOf course, in an era when concerns over privacy and personal data are becoming increasingly prominent, the ability to generate masses of personal data might be worrying. However, Aamir Butt affirms that the cryptographic and distributed aspects of blockchain tech provide a reliable way of minimizing threats to data security:\n\"The use of cryptographic handshakes before data is transferred ensures that the right information is allocated to the right patient, and the right tests are performed so that the right future care can be planned and delivered. Indeed, that provides for devices to be authenticated as well. The practice of medical fraud \u2013 use of fake devices, charging patients for tests not done and more \u2013 is relevant across the world, but especially in developing countries. By authenticating devices on the blockchain, using these cryptographic handshakes, the opportunity for that fraud is shrunk dramatically.\"\nNot only does DLT promise to improve data security and reduce the chances of medical fraud, but it could also allow for more connected national systems of medical data. As Butt explains, systems prevalent in the United Kingdom, the United States and other developed countries currently create \"fragmented silos of data, which means benefits of aggregated data are hard to access, made worse through a lack of data integrity.\"\nFortunately, blockchain enables a new model for handling patient data. \"In a distributed ledger, the database is distributed across the network, with transaction integrity maintained through cryptography,\" Butt says.\nResearch and funding\nBecause data is becoming so integral to the world's health systems, and because more and more of it is being created, health care is now providing one of the clearest use cases for DLT. That said, the role of blockchains in medicine isn't restricted to the better management of data, but also to funding \u2014 something that can improve outcomes in drug discovery and medical research.\nIn September, the California-based pharmaceutical company Verseon launched its own securities exchange, which will enable decentralized, blockchain-based trading in tokenized securities. This might seem like an odd thing for a pharma company to do, but as CEO Adityo Prakash tells Cointelegraph, it will open new possibilities for the health industry:\n\"Securing funding is also very important for the development of new medicines as well as other healthcare technologies. Needless to say, improvements in healthcare critically depends on new medical innovations. By using blockchain technology to conduct regulations compliant sale and trading of tokenized securities Verseon is attempting to change how life science innovations are funded, who gets to participate and to enjoy the potential returns.\"\nVerseon isn't the only platform to have launched with the promise of improving the quality of medical research. In March, California-based Medable\u00a0announced its Insight platform, which enables medical researchers to share data and other info-based resources. Not only does this cut down on the cost of research, but Insight will also reward those who share new data with the blockchain-based platform, with rewards coming in the form of funding and medical technology.", "birthday": "2019-01-09T16:54:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-09 16:54:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 9}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nSome of the most prominent investors continue to back cryptocurrency and the blockchain technology. Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing has invested in the latest funding round of Intercontinental Exchange\u2019s (ICE) crypto trading platform Bakkt through his venture capital firm Horizon Ventures.\nSimilarly, Wall Street investor Bill Miller, who had invested in Bitcoin previously, expects the leading cryptocurrency to be worth either a lot more or zero.\nAccording to Miller, he likes to keep cryptocurrencies in his portfolio because their performance is decoupled from the traditional asset classes. Though an active investor, he considers himself a \u201cBitcoin observer,\u201d but not a \u201cbeliever\u201d yet.\nOn the other hand, the Winklevoss brothers are big believers in cryptocurrencies. They expect the market capitalization of Bitcoin to cross that of gold in the future. Because of that, they continue to support the idea of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nThe recent Ethereum Classic (ETC) 51 percent attack has many worried whether the same can be happen to Bitcoin (BTC) in the future. The opinions are divided, but such challenges are to be expected in a new asset class. This will only encourage the participants to find solutions to avoid such attacks in the future.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin has been trading near the neckline for the past two days. The bulls have been unable to complete the inverse head and shoulders pattern, but they have not given up much ground either. This is a positive sign.\n\nBoth moving averages are flattening out, which suggests a change in trend. If the BTC/USD pair climbs above $4,255, it will signal the formation of a short-term bottom. Hence, we have recommended a buy in one of our earlier analyses. The pattern target on a break out of the inverse head and shoulders pattern is $5,500.\nIf the bears sink the digital currency below the right shoulder, the sentiment will turn bearish and can result in a retest of the low of $3,236.09. If this support breaks, the downtrend will resume.\nETH/USD\nThe bears have been defending the $167.32 mark for the past seven days. If Ethereum breaks down of the uptrend line and the 20-day EMA, it can dip to the 50-day SMA at $120.\n\nOn the other hand, if the bulls break out of $167.32, the ETH/USD pair can rally to the next level of $225 and above it to $249.93. Hence, traders can buy on a close above $167.32 and keep a stop loss of $130.\nThe 20-day EMA is trending up and 50-day SMA is flat, which shows that the downtrend is over. Therefore, traders should look to buy on dips, as long as the price remains above the 50-day SMA. A break of this moving average can result in a drop to $100 and below that to $83.\nXRP/USD\nRipple has been trading in a tight range for the past few days. Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is close to the neutral zone, which suggests a balance between demand and supply.\n\nThe balance will shift in favor of the bulls when the XRP/USD pair rises above $0.4. Though the pattern target is $0.52205, the resistance line of the descending channel can act as a roadblock.\nThe digital currency will turn negative if it breaks below the support at $0.32615. Traders can initiate long positions on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.4 with a stop loss at $0.32.\nBCH/USD\nAfter a strong run from the lows, Bitcoin Cash has been consolidating in a tight range for the past few days. Both moving averages have flattened out, which shows a balance between the buyers and sellers.\n\nA break out of the range can resume the recovery and propel the BCH/USD pair to the next target of $307.01, with a minor resistance at $239.\nTherefore, we suggest traders wait for a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $181 to enter long positions. The stop loss can be kept at $138. A break below $141 will be a negative development that can result in a drop to $100 and below that to $73.5.\nEOS/USD\nEOS has been stuck in a range for the past few days. Both moving averages are flat, and the RSI is just above the neutral territory. This suggests that the consolidation might extend for a few more days.\n\nThe longer the consolidation, the stronger will be the breakout or breakdown from it. Therefore, we recommend long positions on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $3.2081. The targets to watch on the upside are $3.8723, $4.1069 and $4.493.\nIf, however, the EOS/USD pair plunges below the range, it can decline to the low of $1.55. Therefore, the stop loss on the proposed long positions can be kept at $2.29.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin has stayed above the neckline for the past three days but hasn\u2019t been able to move higher. This shows a lack of buying at higher levels.\nHowever, if the bears fail to break below the neckline and the 20-day EMA within the next couple of days, buyers will likely step in. The targets to watch on the upside are $47.246 and $56.910. The stop loss can be kept at $27.5, which can be trailed higher as the price moves up.\n\nWe are bullish because the LTC/USD pair has formed a reversal pattern and the moving averages have completed a bullish crossover. All these point to a probable bottom at $23.1.\nOur view will be negated if the cryptocurrency slips below the moving averages and the $27.701 mark. The downtrend will resume on a fall below $23.1.\nXLM/USD\nStellar has not shown a meaningful recovery in the recent pullback. It continues to face resistance at $0.13427050. The pair is currently trading inside a symmetrical triangle.\n\nThe resistance line of the triangle, the 50-day SMA and the horizontal resistance at $0.13427050 are all located close to each other. Therefore, once the XLM/USD pair rises above this cluster of resistances, it can move up to $0.184, which might act as a stiff resistance.\nOn the other hand, a break below the triangle can result in a retest of the lows. A break below $0.09285498 can resume the downtrend. We might propose a trade after the break out of the resistance sustains for a day. Until then, we suggest traders remain on the sidelines.\nTRX/USD\nTron\u00a0has continued its strong run and has reached the critical resistance of $0.02815521. This is a major hurdle as the bulls could not scale it in the past five months. Therefore, the traders who went long at lower levels based on our suggestion, can book 50 percent of profits at the current levels, if they have not done so already. The stops on the remaining position can be trailed higher.\n\nIf the virtual currency breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above $0.02815521, a new uptrend is probable. Following the breakout, the next level to watch on the upside is $0.03801042. Therefore, we are not advising to close the entire position.\nIf the TRX/USD pair turns down from the current levels, it is likely to remain range bound for a few more days.\nBSV/USD\nThe range in Bitcoin SV has shrunk in the past few days. A period of low volatility is usually followed by an increase in volatility.\n", "birthday": "2019-01-09T20:03:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-09 20:03:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 9}

Following what the company described as an \u201cunexpected loss,\u201d the firm officially pulled out of its mining business.\n\nIn June, the Japanese company allocated around 10 percent of the firm\u2019s capital and resources to engage in an ambitious mining venture with the vision of competing against Bitmain.\nAt the time, the company established a dedicated cryptocurrency mining equipment development department to create its own 7-nanometer (nm) ASIC chips to run a large-scale mining facility. The GMO team said in June:\n\u201cWe will use cutting-edge 7 nm process technology for chips to be used in the mining process, and are currently working on its research and development with our alliance partner having semiconductor design technology to realize high performance computer for mining. It will be possible to reduce power consumption compared to the existing mining machines with the same performance, and achieve a computational performance of 10TH/s [transactions per second] per chip.\u201d\nThe company, despite its large amount of capital and resources, failed to take the size of the operations of Bitmain into consideration. As early as mid-2017, Bitmain was seeking a valuation of over $15 billion, anticipating a successful initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong.\nCurrently, GMO is valued at just over 169 billion yen, equivalent to around $1.5 billion. That is, a mere 10 percent of Bitmain\u2019s valuation earlier this year.\nInitially, GMO was convinced that, as a major internet conglomerate in Asia, it could outpace Bitmain and secure a big portion of the market share of the cryptocurrency mining industry. However, as a report by BitMEX would later reveal, Bitmain was ready for such competition and was willing to operate at a loss to squeeze out its competition.\nOn Christmas Day, Dec. 25, GMO called off its mining operation, absorbing the $320 million loss and halting the development, manufacturing and sales of its mining equipment immediately. A public document released by GMO read:\n\u201cAfter taking into consideration changes in the current business environment, the Company expects that it is difficult to recover the cryptocurrency-mining-business-related assets through selling mining machines, so the Company has decided to stop the development, manufacture, and sales of mining machines, thereby recording an extraordinary loss. GMO Internet will record losses from the transfer of receivables of approximately JPY 17.5 billion and allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately JPY 3.5 billion, recording an extraordinary loss of approximately JPY 24.0 billion in total on the consolidated accounts and the individual accounts.\u201d\nEven Bitmain struggled\nThe main competition of GMO was Bitmain, and GMO set out to outcompete the China-based cryptocurrency mining equipment manufacturer since its inception.\nBut, according to a report released by BitMEX Research, Bitmain sold many of its S9 miners, its flagship product, at a loss throughout the year, in a likely attempt to establish its dominance over the sector by engaging in a price war with its competition, which it knew other companies in the space could not handle.\nIn August, when the report of BitMEX Research was released, the price of Bitcoin was still hovering at around $7,000, above the breakeven cost of mining. As such, by the end of the third quarter of 2018, miners in the cryptocurrency space were still making profits and Bitmain was able to sell its Antminer S9 to mining facilities across the world.\nDue to relatively high demand for mining, at the time, Bitmain could handle losses at the cost of creating a more inefficient environment for its competitors. But, as months passed by and a full-blown bear market hit in November, as the price of Bitcoin fell below the breakeven cost of mining at $6,900, Bitmain also started to struggle.\nA paper by BitMEX Research released on Aug. 30 read:\n\u201cThis analysis implies Bitmain are currently loss-making, with a negative profit margin of 11.6% for the main S9 product and a margin of over negative 100% on the L3 product. In reality costs are likely to have declined so the situation may not be as bad, however we think it is likely Bitmain are currently making significant losses. These low prices are likely to be a deliberate strategy by Bitmain, to squeeze out their competition by causing them to experience lower sales and therefore financial difficulties.\u201d\nFollowing a poor three-month period from September to December, Bitmain reportedly laid off 50 percent of its workforce. On MaiMai, a Chinese social media platform, one Bitmain employee confirmed that more than 50 percent \u201cof the entire Bitmain\u2019s headcount\u201d has started to be let go.\nThe Bitmain staff member also added that some departments \u201chave to be let go entirely\u201d due to market conditions.\nThe priority of the layoff is expected to be newly established departments that work outside of the core scope and business model of Bitmain, such as artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe problem with Bitmain and other companies\u2019 wide approach\nIn May, Bitmain released a statement that was not expected by the cryptocurrency community, disclosing the company\u2019s long-term plans to compete against Nvidia, Intel and AMD \u2014 companies valued at over $100 billion \u2014 in the area of AI.\nConfident in the sustainability of the cryptocurrency mining industry, Bitmain started to enter entirely new industries to go against some of the largest technology companies in the world.\nIn a series of interviews with Bloomberg Businessweek, Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu said that AI chips are similar to Bitcoin mining chips in the sense that AI requires \u201clots of computations\u201d and Bitcoin mining requires application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips, which are applicable in AI. Essentially, the plan of Bitmain was to create chips using its existing chip designs to power AI systems and software.\nThe problem Bitmain and most companies in the cryptocurrency had in the first few quarters of 2018 was the aggressive diversification of services and products, often expanding outside of cryptocurrencies, without making necessary improvements in their core products and business models.\nConsenSys, for instance, the biggest blockchain software studio in the world, based in New York, laid off over 300 employees from its workforce to focus on a select group of products it can push to the mainstream to acquire active users.\nMany companies in the cryptocurrency space, including the mining sector, have expanded their businesses to different sectors by moving out of the scope of mining and mining equipment manufacturing, and the overly aggressive approach failed as market conditions worsened in the third and fourth quarter of 2018.\n\nNot all negative\nAccording to cryptocurrency market data provider and wallet platform Blockchain, the hash rate of Bitcoin \u2014 or the level of computing power that supports the Bitcoin network \u2014 has declined from 61 exahash to 44 exahash, from August to December.\nOn Dec. 3, Malachi Salcido, the head of Salcido Enterprises, one of the largest mining facilities in the U.S., said that miners had left the market en masse. The executive emphasized that the price of cryptocurrencies would have to increase by large margins for mining to be profitable, but said that smart money is watching for the trend to reverse.\n\u201cI expect where we are at to possibly get a little worse before it gets better. Like all market bottoms, smart money is watching for the turn, that doesn\u2019t happen usually quickly. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the bottom is finally in February,\u201d Salcido said, following the release of a paper by Fundstrat that revealed that at least 100,000 individual miners have exited the space.\nHowever, from January of 2018 to December, the hash rate of Bitcoin has increased from 17 exahash to 44 exahash. Despite the substantial drop in the hash power of the dominant cryptocurrency, on a yearly basis, the hash rate of Bitcoin has risen by 158 percent.\n\nThe recovery in the hash power of the Bitcoin network in December and the relatively high computing power of the cryptocurrency likely comes from large-scale facilities that are continuing to mine the digital asset.\nAlthough individual miners relying on cloud mining platforms and small ASIC mining rigs are able to exit the space with a small loss, it is difficult for mining centers that have acquired long-term contracts from electric grid operators and purchased large amounts of ASIC miners to bring their operations to a halt.\nAs security expert and cryptocurrency researcher Andreas Antonopoulos explained:\n\"Part of the reason that's [i.e., the death spiral of crypto] unlikely to happen is that miners have a much more long-term perspective. Meaning that, they have existing investments in equipment and they usually purchase electricity on long-term plans, they don't pay it by the week. And therefore, if they have to wait to become profitable another three months and they have the equipment in place, they're not turning it off.\"", "birthday": "2019-01-10T11:31:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-10 11:31:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 10}

The company then paused all ETC transactions.\nCoinbase had identified a \u201cdeep chain reorganization\u201d of the ETC blockchain which included a double spend on Saturday, Jan. 5. By the evening of Jan. 7, the company had taken stock of multiple double spends on the network:\n\u201cAt time of writing, we have identified a total of 15 reorganizations, 12 of which contained double spends, totaling 219,500 ETC (~$1.1M).\u201d\nThe Coinbase team seems to have conducted a thorough blockchain analysis and provided specific instances of blockchain reorganization.\nCrypto exchanges Coincheck and BitFlyer followed suit, announcing halts of ETC transactions on their platforms.\nOn Jan. 9, SlowMist released a detailed report on the 51 percent attack, corroborating the same chain reorganizations released by Coinbase, as well as other transactions targeting Binance and Bitrue wallets. Bitrue also confirmed the attack on Twitter.\nSlowMist also believes that a concerted effort by all the exchanges involved could help identify the perpetrator:\n\u201cThrough our intelligence analysis, the identity of the attacker can be finally located if the relevant exchanges are willing to assist.\u201d\nCryptocurrency exchange Gate.io also confirmed that it had picked up at least seven double spend transactions after conducting its own investigation into the attack. Users of the exchange were guaranteed to be paid back for any losses experienced.\nUnpacking blockchain reorganization\nThe notion of a 51 percent attack is not new, and there have been instances of this over the years \u2014 even being popularized by the Hollywood sitcom Silicon Valley.\nAn attack on a blockchain that uses a PoW algorithm for consensus is possible if the attackers have over 50 percent control of the network hash rate.\nIf this is the case, the controlling CPU power will allow an attacker to create a seperate chain from any previous block in the blockchain. Given that it has the majority of computing power, its new chain will eventually overtake the accepted chain by the network, thereby defining a new transaction history.\nIn this new chain, the attackers are able to double spend virtual currency, meaning that the funds that have already been spent on the network\u2019s chain could be spent again on the attackers chain.\nAs Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, a developer and professor at Cornell University, told Cointelegraph, a 51 percent attack is bad, but it does not give attackers omnipotent power:\n\u201cMiners at 51 percent or more have a lot of powers, but they do not have the ability to change the actual rules of the system, nor can they usurp funds. They can rewrite the existing blockchain in a limited fashion: they cannot introduce transactions that don\u2019t already exist, they can omit any transaction that they want, and they certainly cannot change any of the existing rules.\u201d\nThe reality of consensus\nProof-of-work consensus requires a network of miners to process transactions. This is clearly set out in Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s Bitcoin white paper, which also makes it clear that more than half of the network must be so-called \u201chonest\u201d workers:\n\u201cIf a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains.\u201d\nThus, vulnerability is inherently built into PoW consensus algorithms, as the network assumes that mining nodes are honestly validating transactions. The evolution of mining has seen the rise and domination of ASIC chips \u2014 as well as the amassing of hash power by massive groups of mining pools, which then share the rewards of their combined work.\nThese large pools potentially pose a threat to any cryptocurrency using PoW algorithms, as a concerted effort to pool resources that would combine hash rate over 50 percent of the total network gives them control. In this instance, the network becomes centralized like a bank.\nFollowing the ETC attack, Litecoin (LTC) founder Charlie Lee said this vulnerability is a necessary point of weakness for a fully decentralized cryptocurrency:\n\u201cBy definition, a decentralized cryptocurrency must be susceptible to 51% attacks whether by hashrate, stake, and/or other permissionlessly-acquirable resources. If a crypto can't be 51% attacked, it is permissioned and centralized.\u201d\nGun Sirer was far less positive in a thread of posts on Twitter, noting that the immutability of the blockchain was completely compromised:\n\u201cA deep reorg is a rewrite of the blockchain, a rewriting of history. As such, it marks complete failure of immutability. Since immutability is ETC's main claim to fame, this is technically a catastrophic failure. Let's see what the exchanges will do in response.\u201d\nChanges to Ethereum proof-of-work\nWhile the ETC blockchain comes to grips with this most recent debacle, Ethereum (ETH) core developers reached a tentative consensus to implement a new PoW algorithm on Jan. 4.\nThe move aims to address the apparent divide in efficiency between ASIC and GPU mining on the Ethereum network.", "birthday": "2019-01-10T13:56:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-10 13:56:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 10}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nWill 2019 be a year of recovery for cryptocurrencies? One of the important events to watch out for is the launch of International Exchange\u2019s (ICE) crypto trading platform Bakkt. While the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) currently offer Bitcoin futures trading, both of their products are settled in cash.\nMany believe that futures physically delivered in actual bitcoins, as Bakkt plans to do it, will encourage the institutional involvement that has so far been largely elusive.\nAnother important point of attention are regulations. The Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, \u00a0led by the Winklevoss twins, has been calling for more clearly defined regulations for the industry, and has actually launched an ad campaign to promote that idea. However, some of the more die hard supporters of crypto don\u2019t agree with Gemini\u2019s idea.\nIn regards to a more widespread adoption of the blockchain technology, strategy and corporate finance consulting company McKinsey & Company believes that it is yet to prove itself an actual game changer.\nWe expect the industry to make enough progress this year, so as to attract the institutional money needed to move on to the next leg of the bull phase.\nBTC/USD\nThe tight range in Bitcoin was resolved to the upside on Jan. 6. Currently, the bulls are attempting to extend the pullback to $4,255. A break out of this level will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern that has a target of $5,500. Therefore, we have retained the buy recommendation provided in the previous analysis.\n\nIf the price fails to climb above $4,255, the BTC/USD pair will attract short sellers. Any break of the immediate support of $3,550 can drag the price back to the lows. The downtrend will resume if the cryptocurrency makes a new yearly low.\nThe 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is close to the midpoint. This points to a possible consolidation in the short term. The 50-day SMA, however, continues to point down, which suggests that the long-term trend is still down.\nETH/USD\nEthereum has been trading close to $167.32 for the past five days. Though the bulls have failed to break out of the overhead resistance, one positive thing is that the price has not given up much ground.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is sloping up and the RSI has sustained above 50 levels for the past few days. This confirms that the bulls have the upper hand in the short term. The 50-day SMA is flat, which confirms that the long-term trend is also changing.\nA breakout above $167.32 can result in a move to $225, followed by a rally to $249.93. Our bullish view will be negated if the ETH/USD pair plunges below the moving averages.\nXRP/USD\nRipple is trading in a descending channel. Both moving averages are flattening out and the RSI is close to the 50 level. This suggests a consolidation in the near term.\n\nThe XRP/USD pair has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $0.4. Such a move has a pattern target of $0.52205.\nTherefore, we propose traders buy on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.4 with the stop loss at $0.33. On the upside, the upper bound of the descending channel might offer resistance; hence, traders should raise their stops to breakeven if the pair struggles at this level. It will turn negative below $0.33.\nBCH/USD\nThough Bitcoin Cash broke out of the descending channel, it has not been able to move higher. For the past three days, the range has shrunk, and both moving averages have flattened out. The RSI is also close to neutral territory. This suggests a balance between the buyers and the sellers.\n\nThis tight range is likely to resolve on either side within the next few days. An upward break will carry the digital currency to $239 and above it to $307.01. On the other hand, a range expansion on the downside can pull it lower to $141 and below that to $100. We couldn\u2019t find any clear buy setups on the BCH/USD pair, so we are not suggesting a trade in it.\nEOS/USD\nThe level of $3 has been acting as a stiff resistance for the past few days. A break out of the $3\u2013$3.2081 zone will carry EOS to the next overhead resistance at $3.8723.\n\nThe moving averages are on the verge of completing a bullish crossover, which suggests that the short-term trend is likely to turn in favor of the bulls.\nConversely, if the EOS/USD pair breaks below both moving averages and the $2.1733 mark, it can retest the low of $1.55.\nXLM/USD\nThe short-term trend in Stellar has become range bound, whereas the long-term trend still remains headed down. A break out of $0.13427050 will be a positive sign that can push the price to the next overhead resistance of $0.184.\n\nHowever, if the bears fail to break out of the stiff overhead resistance, the coin might remain stuck in a tight range until it slides below $0.11024826. Below this level, the XLM/USD pair can retest the low of $0.09285498. We still can\u2019t find any reliable buy setups; hence, we are not recommending a trade in the pair.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin completed an inverse head and shoulders pattern on Jan. 6. This has triggered our buy setup proposed in the previous analysis. The pair now has a pattern target of $49.756. If the bulls sustain above $47.246, the price can move up to $56.910.\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is also in the positive territory. This is a bullish sign. Our positive view will be invalidated if the LTC/USD pair plunges below $27.701.\nBSV/USD\nBitcoin SV is not finding any interest from the buyers. It continues to languish in the tight range of $80.352\u2013$102.58. This shows that the bulls are not keen to buy above the range and the bears are not willing to sell below it.\n\nA break out of this range can carry the BSV/USD pair to the top of the broader range of $80.352\u2013$123.98. On a close above $123.98, the rally can extend to $167.608.\nIf, however, the bears sink the pair below $80.352, it can slide further to $65.031 and below that to $38.528. It is difficult to predict which way the break will happen; hence, it is best to remain on the sidelines until the breakout sustains above $102.58.\nTRX/USD\nTRON reached our first target objective of $0.0246 on Jan. 6. The next target on the upside is $0.02815521. We expect this level to act as a strong resistance, so the traders can close 50 percent of their long trades at this level.\n", "birthday": "2019-01-07T23:40:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-07 23:40:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 7}

A country where serenity and tranquillity can be found in the middle of the hustle and bustle of large global cities, where proud traditionalism stands side-by-side with the developers and innovators of breakthrough technologies, where kimonos are often found next to the latest fashion trends.\nThis contradictory tendency is no different in Japan\u2019s cryptocurrency ecosystem. It ranks as one of the top crypto-friendly nations on Earth, with favorable and forward-thinking cryptocurrency regulations. They made Bitcoin legal tender in 2017, and at one point, the Japanese yen dominated the buying and trading of Bitcoin. The Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) has also received 190 cryptocurrency exchange license applications.\n\nYet, even though Japan has played host to some of the biggest crypto hacks to date (including Mt. Gox and Coincheck), they are still mostly a cash-based society where about 65 percent of transactions are done in cash (more than twice the 32 percent average among other rich economies) and, perhaps because of this, the Bank of Japan has repeatedly stated that they see no need or demand for a central bank-issued digital currency and that it is not an effective economic tool.\nAccording to Yuko Kawai, the head of the Fintech Center at the Bank of Japan, because of the low demand, the central bank is not at the stage yet where they will consider issuing a digital currency:\n\u201cTo begin with, do we really need a digital currency in the nation where cashless living isn\u2019t making much progress?\u201d\nDespite these supposedly adverse sentiments, several banks in Japan are actually launching their own digital currencies.\nMizuho Financial Group\nThe Mizuho Financial Group announced in December 2018 that they will be issuing their own digital currency in March 2019. They are one of the largest financial institutions in the world that offers financial and strategic services, with 60,000 employees and $1.9 trillion assets under management.\nThe digital currency will be the first to be issued by a megabank and will enable users to make cashless payments with their smartphones, as well as allowing free cash transfers between users.\n\nIt is part of the J-Coin project, an initiative by the Mizuho Financial Group and Japan Post Bank, which further involves around 60 regional banks.\nUnder the J-Coin project, the digital currency will be fixed (pegged) 1:1 to the Japanese yen to reduce volatility, and the commission that shops have to pay credit card companies will be kept low.\nMizuho also hopes in the future that the J-Coin could be used for salary payments and also to team up with Alipay, an online payments platform that uses QR codes, to enable foreign visitors to easily make payments in Japan.\nWith the J-Coin, Mizuho has made it possible for regional banks to utilize a scheme to issue their own branded coins.\nAccording to Mizuho Financial Group President Tatsufumi Sakai, the J-Coin scheme will allow them to take advantage of the data revolution by using the data obtained through the new payment service for its future businesses:\n\u201cThe business of financial settlements has become more important and is expected to continue to grow. So we have to take a serious approach.\u201d\nMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG)\nMUFG is the largest financial company in Japan and the world\u2019s fifth-largest bank, with $2.7 trillion assets under management.\nThey announced a trial of their own cryptocurrency in May 2018, and by September 2018, they had experimented with the MUFG coin at a convenience store for employees. The MUFG coin will be pegged 1:1 to the Japanese yen and the company aims for it to be applied to a variety of everyday financial needs, such as withdrawals and deposits to transactions and payments.\n\nThey remain optimistic about the use cases for the MUFG coin:\n\u201cPotentially this coin could have large-scale commercial potential, as well as serving small-scale retail bank customers. Other than MUFG Coin, MUFG is testing another untitled digital currency rewards for employees who reduce their overtime hours and practice a healthy lifestyle, which resonates strongly to the work style reform of Abenomics.\u201d\nIn May 2018, MUFG also completed a cross-border payment pilot test using Thai bank Krungsri\u2019s Blockchain Interledger to send money, in a matter of seconds, from a Thailand-based Mitsubishi Group subsidiary to the Standard Chartered account of a Singapore-based Mitsubishi Group subsidiary, and they announced a partnership with United States-based cloud delivery platform, Akamai Technologies, to release a global payment network based on blockchain.", "birthday": "2019-01-07T18:18:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-07 18:18:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 7}

To make the booking process easier for users who are unfamiliar with blockchain, the startup has created a service model that allows an instant connection between credit cards and the company\u2019s ERC-20 LOC token. Travelers who are not crypto-oriented can make reservations by using a credit card in the exact same way as on any regular travel site, and the exchange for crypto will be executed automatically via an API connectivity with exchanges where LOC is traded.\nEach booking is locked into a smart contract until the checkout is done. The company says booking through their marketplace is much more affordable and secure for the guests when compared to traditional ways of making reservations, in which the customer risks not getting the service that has already been paid for.\nIn addition to the web-based travel marketplace, LockTrip has already launched its mobile app for Android and iOS. The startup is also working on creating its own hybrid proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain for which they have already deployed an operational testnet.

Organized by crypto investor and podcast host Trace Mayer, it urged cryptocurrency traders to withdraw their holdings from crypto exchanges, in order to promote the decentralization and monetary independence on which Satoshi Nakamoto's vision for Bitcoin was founded.\nHowever, as ostensibly positive as its message was, it was claimed on social media in the days leading up to the event that several exchanges \u2014 most notably\u00a0HitBTC \u2014 had apparently been freezing accounts and preventing users from withdrawing their funds.\nThese are serious charges, but while they raise questions about who really owns the coins traded via big exchanges, the issue could be more complicated than HitBTC's detractors would have everyone believe. For one, exchanges have a record of halting withdrawals and freezing accounts as part of their normal business, so it's not certain that HitBTC or any other exchange was specifically opposing Proof of Keys and trying to prevent a mass reclamation of Bitcoin. And secondly, it's worth pointing out that Proof of Keys is not a grassroots, community-led event. Rather, it\u2019s an initiative spearheaded by entrepreneur Trace Mayer, who happens to be an\u00a0investor in Armory, a crypto wallet manufacturer that obviously has a financial interest in people taking their coins out of exchanges. As such, his claims of widespread account blockages should perhaps be treated with scepticism.\nCharges\nThe suspicion that HitBTC was blocking accounts and withdrawals because of Proof of Keys emerged on Reddit and Twitter. On the HitBTC subreddit, most of the current posts have been made by users complaining that they've been unable to withdraw their crypto. On Jan. 1, for instance, Reddit user pedxs\u00a0wrote that HitBTC is \"now not allowing withdrawing, even for [my] accounts that passed KYC,\" while\u00a0other users have\u00a0reported similar\u00a0issues, in addition to\u00a0claiming that the exchange is\u00a0fraudulent in general.\nUnsurprisingly, these reports have led to a vociferous reaction from those organizing and supportive of the Proof of Keys event. On Jan. 2, Trace Mayer noted on Twitter that a \"friend\" had been told by HitBTC that \"Withdrawals are temporarily disabled on your account,\" leading him to suggest that \"@hitbtc failed #ProofOfKeys.\"\nSimilarly, John McAfee \u2014 who also has a financial interest in a crypto wallet (Bitfi, which he was paid to endorse) \u2014 was quick to vent his spleen against the exchange. He wrote on Twitter:\nI warned everyonw more than a dozen times. Don't sign up. Don't use it. Withdtaw your funds. I was trashed for calling out HitBT as a corrupt cimpany. Tough shit. You had six months warning from me to withdraw your funds. Do not ask me to help you now.https://t.co/Ls9mzpUSbz\u2014 John McAfee (@officialmcafee) January 2, 2019\n\nComplicating the issue further, Trace Mayer also\u00a0reported Proof of Keys \"failures\" at Coinbase, Poloniex, Bitfinex, and Purse.io (an escrow service and online marketplace, rather than an exchange). However, there really isn't much online that would confirm widespread problems (at least not on the scale of HitBTC).\nFor example, in the\u00a0Coinbase subreddit, there is currently one post from someone bemused as to why a 72-hour quarantine on withdrawals had been imposed on them, yet there is nothing else from the period before and after Proof of Keys that would suggest something unusual or untoward. Much the same goes for the\u00a0Poloniex,\u00a0Bitfinex and\u00a0Purse.io subreddits, although in each of these it was hard to find even a single complaint (there was\u00a0one gripe about a frozen Purse.io account, but this related more to an issue with an Amazon purchase than a specific withdrawal problem).\nAnd in fact, when it comes to the original complaint, HitBTC has itself informed Cointelegraph that there is no link between Proof of Keys day and any account suspensions. It\u2019s spokesperson, Peter Swen, stated that frozen withdrawals were the result of internal security measures related to KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) procedures.\n\u201cThese temporary, safety-related withdrawal freezings are a direct consequence of our international KYC and AML measures. These rules exist and apply to us and everybody, 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year.\u201d\nA history of withdrawal issues\nIt is, therefore, hard to sustain a narrative that exchanges in general were deliberately subverting Proof of Keys or unable to deal with the sheer number of withdrawals (there's also no evidence of just how popular the event was). And while it would seem from social media that HitBTC had a comparatively high number of blocked withdrawals, it is in fact hard to prove that it deliberately set about opposing the event. Not only is this because it\u2019s explicitly denying a link, but also because it already had a less-than-perfect reputation when it comes to withdrawals.\nFor example, HitBTC has a three-out-five rating on Trustpilot, with\u00a034 percent of its ratings being one star. Many of the negative reviewers (which date from months before Proof of Keys) have complained about being unable to withdraw funds, although HitBTC's response to this review site reveal that they strenuously deny any such problem. Equally disconcerting, there are a number of negative reviews of the exchange on crypto news and reviews sites, such as\u00a099Bitcoins and\u00a0CoinSutra, with experienced reviewers on both sites making explicit reference to difficulties in withdrawing.\nIn other words, HitBTC has always had reported problems with withdrawals, so it seems unlikely that the problems reported now are the result of it trying to stymie Proof of Keys day. Rather, it's likelier that withdrawal issues have moved more into the public eye as a result of the attention surrounding Proof of Keys, leading to the impression that there has been a sudden increase in account and withdrawal suspensions. The reviews above \u2014 many of which are many months old \u2014 suggest that there hasn't been a significant increase, even if it would be possible to say that HitBTC has indeed \u201cfailed\u201d Proof of Keys, i.e., in the narrow sense of failing to let at least some of its users withdraw their coins.\nConflict of interest\nWhile HitBTC's problems need to be highlighted, some of the spotlight should also be shined on Proof of Keys day. Its organizer \u2014 Trace Mayer \u2014 is a key investor in Armory, which, as stated above, provides an open-source cryptocurrency wallet. Back in 2013, it raised $600,000 in seed funding, with this funding being \"led\" by Mayer, according to a\u00a0statement released by Armory Technologies at the time. He has, therefore, a significant stake in seeing wallets such as Armory succeed, something that would be possibly only if crypto traders and holders shook off their dependence on such exchanges as HitBTC (and Coinbase, Poloniex and Bitfinex).\nAnd what would be a good way of encouraging people to abandon exchanges in favor of wallets like Armory? That's right, you guessed it: some kind of event that piggybacks on the interest in Genesis Block Day and that effectively involves urging people to take their crypto out of exchanges and put it in Armory and other wallets. Indeed, it's this motivation that gave birth to Proof of Keys, which, as a result, now emerges as a thinly disguised marketing event masquerading as a community-driven initiative.\nAnd it's in this context that Mayer's recent attempts to tar Coinbase, Poloniex and Bitfinex with the same brush as HitBTC should be framed. Without having much in the way of evidence, his recent tweets have implied that these exchanges \u2014 which, due to their popularity, are symbolic of all centralized exchanges \u2014 have consciously blocked withdrawals, with the further implication being that they oppose their customers having ownership of their coins and having sovereignty over their money. Regardless of how true this claim is, Mayer would certainly benefit if it were widely believed, given his early investment in Armory.\nCentralized exchanges and market distortion", "birthday": "2019-01-05T15:35:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-05 15:35:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 5}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/ico-market-2018-vs-2017-trends-capitalization-localization-industries-success-rate", "title": " ICO Market 2018 vs 2017: Trends, Capitalization, Localization, Industries, Success Rate ", "content": "Disclaimer: This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe ICO market data is provided by ICObench, based upon the projects\u2019 announcements recorded in ICObench database, which includes over 5,100 ICOs since August 2015.\nIn 2018, 2,284 initial coin offerings (ICOs) reached their conclusion and investors could choose, on average, among 482 token sales opening every day of the year. During 2017, the corresponding values were just 966 and 91 ICOs respectively.\nHowever, the economic results are less impressive: The total amount raised in 2018 was almost $11.4 billion, against little more than $10 billion during 2017, with a mere 13 percent growth.\nA balance of the general trend of the ICO market during 2018 is, in fact, double-edged. With ICOs in March 2018 collecting almost $1.75 billion, the first half of the year marked the highest point of growth since the beginning of the upward trend that started in late spring 2017, although June 2017's data is an anomaly, as seen below. On the other hand, the closing months of the year recorded a radical downturn, such as in November 2018, which brought in just $0.36 billion, making it the worst result since May 2017.\n\nBoth trends mirror the volatility of the whole crypto market during 2018, especially of Ether, given that Ethereum is the platform the majority of the ICOs issued on their token, with 84.29 percent of the projects, against 1.25 percent raised on Stellar and 0.55 percent on NEO.\nEther achieved its historical highest price on Jan. 13, 2018 (almost $ 1,352), while the lowest level of the year was touched on between Dec. 14 and 15 (around $84, with a loss of about 94 percent of its value). The ICO market seems to react to the trends of the underlying cryptocurrency in slightly volatile ways. In view of the funds raised, the spread between the picks of March and November 2018 is about 79 percent.\nConsidering the data from a medium- and long-term perspective, the funds gathered by ICOs at the end of the year are still far above the level at the beginning of 2017. Even considering only the first 15 days of December \u2014 the data available as of press time \u2014 in January 2017, the capital raised by ICOs amounted to about 1.8 percent of the funds available during the last month of 2018, while Ether capitalization accounted then for about 9 percent of the December 2018 level.\n\nMore ICOs, fewer resources\nThe number of new ICOs listed by ICObench during the year followed the trend already shown before considering the funds raised: March 2018 recorded the highest number of new projects entering the database (528), while the number of incoming ICOs has fallen slightly since the end of the summer, with the lowest recorded figure being in October, when there were 213 new listings. In this case, however, the decrease is less evident than the decline of the amount of capital amassed: Therefore, quite a large number of ICOs are still competing for shrinking resources.\n\nAs a result, the average amount of funds collected by a single ICO during 2018 is smaller than during the previous year \u2014 $11.52 million, against $24.35 million in 2017. Moreover, the differences in size in terms of the actual results of each ICO remains relevant, even if the divergence between the amount of capital raised by the ICOs decreased, especially with a rise in the average size of the smallest ICOs: The least successful ICO that ended during 2017 with a positive result (more than $1) raised $420, while the worst result for 2018 was $761.\nMore significantly, the range between the ICOs that can be viewed as being medium-small to large on the basis of the funds gathered lessened, ranging from $1.49 million to $40 million in 2018, while the range was from $1.4 million to $45 million during the previous year.\n\nDeviation from the average values is higher among the projects positioning themselves in the highest ranking, i.e., the 5 percent of the sample of ICOs reaching the largest amount of funding. In this case, 2017's distribution data was partially distorted by the record achieved by a single project, the new blockchain EOS, which ended its year-long ICO in June that year and gathered almost $4.2 billion \u2014 which is, until now, the largest ICO in the history. EOS aside, the 2017's best performer amassed $258 million, while 2018's best result was $575 million.\nDuring 2018, the top 5 percent of the sample by capitalization (41 ICOs) accounted for about 31.7 percent of all the funds gathered. Among this leading group, 10 ICOs reached $100 million or more \u2014 concentrating about 16 percent of all the capital available in the market during the year. In 2017, the same percentile (21 ICOs) accounted for more than 63 percent of all the funds. However, this data falls to 21.6 percent if EOS's value is not included in the sample. \u00a0\nICOs become (a little more) spread worldwide\nIn 2018, ICO promoters were still choosing to establish their headquarters in a rather small number of countries: At the end of the year, the United States, Singapore and the United Kingdom were the countries hosting the largest number of ICOs since 2015, and these three were also the countries with more new ICOs ending during 2018. In the last year, the U.K. overcame Russia in the general ranking, while Germany reached the eighth position, overtaking Canada and the Netherlands \u2014 the latter of which exited the top 10.\n\nConsidering the whole sample of ICOs indicating a precise localization in their white papers, the spatial concentration decreased from 2017 to 2018: Today, the 10 countries with the largest number of ICO headquarters account for 59 percent of all the projects launched since 2015 while a year ago, this value was about 75 percent.\n\nConcentration, however, remains very high, as seen in the economic indicators. ICOs hosted by the top 10 countries account for about 78 percent of the capital gathered, and the projects establishing their headquarters in the U.S. alone amassed almost 32 percent of the funds. In 2017, these values were even higher: 90 percent and 61 percent, respectively.\n\nTaking into account the economic data about new projects ending during 2018, the dynamic among countries is similar to the trend in the ranking by hosted ICOs. The rise of Estonia (from 11th in 2017 to seventh one year later) and Lithuania (from 21st to 14th) demonstrates the dynamism of Eastern Europe. Still regarded as a part of the Old Continent, Gibraltar rose by 4 positions (from 15th to 11th), thanks to the activism of the local administrators and businesses in promoting the British overseas territory as a new safe harbor for blockchain-based companies.\nLooking to Asia, the decrease in the ranking of mainland China (from 10th to 12th) is compensated for by the stronger rank acquired by Hong Kong, which went from the 12th to the ninth place. Finally, the increasing weight of some Caribbean tax havens \u2014 such as the Cayman Islands, which rose from the ninth to sixth position, and the British Virgin Islands, from 29th to eighth \u2014 stresses the relevance for ICOs concerning issues such as regulations and taxes.\nICO by industry: A strong core and ascending applications\nConsidering the distribution of the projects fueled by ICOs during 2018, the industries that attracted most investment are the sectors closer to the development of the core of the blockchain economy: platforms allowing the interaction among networks of users, smart contracts, internet-based products, and other types of infrastructure relating to some IT network environment. These accounted for about 30 percent of the funds gathered during the year.\n\nOn the other hand, the fintech sector, which includes both banking and financial investment, amassed $4.4 billion, and new blockchains attracted investment of more than $4.2 billion. However, many of the planned 1,111 new cryptocurrencies didn't complete their ICOs with an economic success.\n\nOther industries that achieved positive results during 2018 were positioned in the IT sector and included such businesses involved with software, big data or artificial intelligence. However, some relevant investments were aimed at applications in other sectors, such as business-oriented services, with $2.4 billion (7.4 percent) in funds raised, and entertainment- and media-related industries, with $2.1 billion (6.4 percent).\nThe presence of other sectors further away from IT or high-tech industries is of little significance: Manufacturing accounted for about 1.3 percent, which includes the manufacturing of electronic devices, while projects in businesses based on education or art together weighed in at about 1 percent.\nA comparison with 2017's industry distribution is rather difficult due to the overwhelming weight of EOS's ICO, as that year, new blockchain enterprises accounted for 40.6 percent of the various sectors. However, it is likely that we can recognize both a stable trend of growth involving core industries and a rising role of some fields of application that are closer to final users.\nRaising expectations clash with reality\nThe sum of all the hard caps (HC) set for the token sales ending during 2018 was five times higher than the target aimed for by ICOs in 2017, with $83 billion against almost $15 billion.\nEven stronger was the rise in the planned soft cap (SC) goals. In 2018, these were 12 times the cumulative value planned during 2017, amounting to $13.7 billion in comparison with $1.1 billion in the previous year. As a result, the projects ending during 2018 saw the establishment of a narrower gap between HC and SC than was the case during 2017: Cumulative HC exceeded the lower threshold by six times while the ratio was more than twice that during 2017, which had a cumulative HC set 13 times the amount of the cumulative SC. \u00a0\nIn spite of raising expectations, the market didn't answer to such optimistic figures. The envisaged HC for 2018 was, in fact, 173 percent higher than the actual average market capitalization of Ether during the year. Looking at the actual funds raised, at the end of 2018, ICOs attracted about 23.7 percent of the average value available on the Ethereum ecosystem during the year, while the value with regard to 2017 was more than 47.8 percent.\n", "birthday": "2019-01-05T21:20:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-05 21:20:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 5}

If the user is interested, a bot could provide them with live feedback about what is going on inside, a full list of prices, plus the ability to reserve a table and pay upfront.\nSmall businesses and sole traders would be able to establish their very own bot. For example, a seasoned guitarist would be able to use Localflow\u2019s system to offer private tutoring, or the owner of a pizzeria could build a bot that takes orders and tracks deliveries. Members of the public could also get in on the action, and if they were two footballers short for a five-vs.-five match, they would be able to use the bot to find willing participants.\nLocalflow believes bots could also offer a helping hand to companies behind the scenes, enabling them to keep track of stock levels and replenish warehouses when necessary.\nBots put to the test\nThe company put the features of its bot MVP to the test in Padova, a university city in northern Italy. Initial results were positive, with testers gaining tokens that could be spent on products in local pubs and bars. There are also incentives for businesses, as they could save on marketing costs and avoid the hefty fees charged by the likes of Uber, Airbnb, Deliveroo and Booking.com.", "birthday": "2019-01-07T14:46:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-07 14:46:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 7}

", "content": "Bitcoin has been among the most fascinating tradable assets to watch over the last year. From reaching dazzling new heights to its most recent tumble to fresh one-year lows, the cryptocurrency market has been nothing short of exciting when attempting to characterize its volatile ebb and flow.\nAmid the growing chorus of enthusiasts, activists and investors calling for greater adoption \u2014 and more importantly, the launch of new financial instruments designed to give the budding new asset class greater exposure \u2014 Bitcoin prices have become a bellwether for the market. While still difficult to nail down an exact characterization of cryptocurrency and how it fits within the modern financial paradigm \u2014 whether a currency, digital asset or a commodity \u2014 by evaluating the price action in the context of its more established analogues, it becomes apparent that Bitcoin and its peers have reached significant milestones.\nBy analyzing the characteristics of Bitcoin\u2019s ascent in tandem with commodities like gold and oil or technology stocks that managed to survive the last tech bubble, it is easier to clarify Bitcoin\u2019s position within the context of past performance and how that may relate to the coin\u2019s outlook. Is the run up really that unprecedented? Or instead, is price performance more of a self-fulfilling prophecy that is bound to experience periods of accumulation, consolidation and distribution akin to rotation evident in other, more established asset classes? We took a side-by-side look to see what types of clues can be gleaned in this historical price context and how Bitcoin stacks up when ranking performance.\nDigital gold\nThe fact that it has existed for 10 years \u2014 despite drawing the ire of regulators, experiencing several exchange hacks, and devolving into a scaling stalemate \u2014 Bitcoin is a modern marvel. Many have compared it with gold and have even assigned Bitcoin the moniker \u201cdigital gold\u201d \u2014 and in some ways, this assessment is accurate.\nWhere gold and Bitcoin are similar lies in the properties of scarcity and inputs required to \u201cmine\u201d (the minting of new assets). They\u2019re uncontrolled by a single entity and extremely difficult to counterfeit. Their downsides are also alike, with limited fungibility despite their generally accepted value and with both being used as haven assets during times of market uncertainty.\nWhen comparing Bitcoin and gold\u2019s charts (top and bottom), there are also similarities. For example, both assets began without having exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with Bitcoin still lacking one. The chart below shows gold before physically backed ETFs were introduced around 15 years ago.\n\nDespite their differing timelines, there are noteworthy similarities when comparing Bitcoin\u2019s pre-ETF chart. It makes perfect sense given that the advances of modern technology accelerate the same chart curves for Bitcoin, whereas gold\u2019s market matured over a series of decades. Furthermore, it suggests that a physically backed ETF contract would do the same for Bitcoin as it once did for gold. After the first gold-backed ETF by ETF Securities hit the market in March 2003 \u2014 and later, when the GLD ETF was introduced \u2014 prices increased to nearly $1,600 from a low of $332. These developments also improved price discovery and liquidity for the gold market while inviting more widespread retail participation.\n\nAn ETF launch might lead the next Bitcoin bull run, just as it once did to gold. Currently, exposing one\u2019s capital to BTC is reminiscent of investing in gold in the 1980s and 1990s, which favored specialists who knew how to obtain and store it physically.\nAs both are considered to be a haven asset, and in terms of transaction volume, gold is gradually being usurped by its digital peer, the correlation between these two assets may be more divergent in the future. Investors increasingly choose Bitcoin and crypto over gold in times of turbulence, and Bitcoin transaction volumes recently surpassed gold for the first time ever. According to the London Bullion Market (LBMA), gold is anticipated to clear $446 billion in settled OTC trades during 2018 while Bitcoin has already recorded $850 billion in transaction volume this year.\nCan crypto sync with tech stocks?\nAnother potential muse for cryptocurrency and Bitcoin could be the tech sector, and it may be an even better control group, given that their utilities align well. Bitcoin\u00a0currently accounts for slightly over 51 percent of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. However, looking at one coin is akin to missing the forest for the trees, with a significant contribution coming from other novel coins and solutions that have since entered the fray, including ICOs.\nBlockchain represents to businesses what the internet was in 1995 \u2014 a better medium for reaching consumers. The expectation that the internet would accelerate the way business is done saw internet-adjacent companies experience a price explosion that is now known as the dot-com bubble. Some mundane companies enjoyed skyrocketing share prices just for launching a website, similar to how novel crypto startups suddenly found themselves managing eight-figure token economies in late 2017. In both cases, excitement over the disruptive potential of the underlying technology obscured individual use cases, but the consequential crash brought meritocracy back to the market.\nThe post-bubble lull for tech stocks didn\u2019t mean that the internet was a bust, it just meant that optimism and speculation outpaced innovation. Moreover, it made room for outstanding tech companies to rise above the noise. Amazon, for instance, represents one of the biggest success stories and performances of all time. Yet, shares collapsed 95 percent during the dot-com boom to as little as $6.00 per share.\n\nA portfolio with just $1,000 of Amazon stock purchased in September 2001 would be worth around $225,000 today.\n\nThe same story also played out for other one-time occupants of the share price trenches like Oracle, Adobe, SanDisk and others. The crypto bubble popping would help separate the winners from the losers. The next time prices reach previous levels, it could be on the backs of companies that leverage blockchain to deliver tangible, real-world value. Does that mean the entire market will rise? For stocks it did. Just look at the NASDAQ-100 chart below:\nCrypto of cause might generate the same interest and value that it once did \u2014 but this isn\u2019t the question. \u00a0\u00a0Would Bitcoin \u2014 the unofficial barometer of the market \u2014 reach its peak price again just as NASDAQ did? This is inconclusive. Bitcoin has value individually, but also functions as a gateway for fiat to enter into the greater crypto space. However, if blockchain will create compliant fiat gateways and fundraising methods in the future, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices could decouple from the value delivered by blockchain. In this case, its chart might slowly grind down to zero as the power of blockchain escapes the confines of its existing fundraising model.", "birthday": "2019-01-03T12:30:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-03 12:30:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 3}

In the last quarter of the year alone, the United States Department of the Treasury, the Canadian Parliament and the Russian Federal Financial Monitoring Service all urged or announced the introduction of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws for cryptocurrencies, and all of them based their moves on the (noticeably mistaken) presumption that cryptocurrencies are a primary haven for criminals, who use them either as a medium of exchange for illicit goods or as a means of hiding (i.e., laundering) the source of dirty money.\nHowever, when the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) dished out a $10 million fine on Dec. 26 for failures to comply with AML legislation, this penalty didn't actually go to a crypto exchange or crypto-related business. Instead, it went to Morgan Stanley, the 38th-biggest bank in the world (and the sixth-biggest in the U.S.). For anyone who's ever noticed the sheer abundance of news stories about crypto's apparent problem with money laundering, this may come as a shock, yet a deeper inspection of recent history reveals that the traditional financial world, in fact, has just as serious a problem with laundering as crypto, if not a more serious problem.\nAnd what's particularly interesting about the issue of money laundering is that, while the cryptocurrency industry is rapidly tightening up its own codes and conduct, the established financial industry still seems stuck on a plateau of underlying illegality, despite its vastly superior position and resources. Indeed, crypto exchanges are increasingly observing Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML regulations, while new trade bodies are being established with the aim of erecting self-regulatory guidelines for the crypto industry to follow. And in the industry's zeal to become a fully legitimate and secure feature of the global economic landscape, it might just have a thing or two to teach the pre-existing banking sector.\nMorgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, UBS and so on\u2026\nAs reported by Reuters, FINRA slapped a $10 million fine on Morgan Stanley's brokerage arm for long-standing failures in its AML reporting system. Between January 2011 and April 2016, Morgan Stanley's automated monitoring system failed (for an undisclosed reason) to receive vital customer information and data from the bank's other systems, thereby preventing it from being able to exhaustively track the movement of \"tens of billions of dollars\" (according to Reuters) in currency transfers and bank wires.\nMaking this lapse even worse for Morgan Stanley, FINRA learned that the bank became aware of deficiencies in its monitoring system as early as 2015, but didn't actually begin taking action to address these issues until February 2017. FINRA also found that, between 2011 and 2013, Morgan Stanley had failed to \u201creasonably monitor\u201d the transfer of 2.7 billion shares of penny stocks, something that needs to be done in order to ensure that the trading volumes of such stocks hadn't been inflated. And tellingly, Morgan Stanley declined to contest both charges, with the bank simply stating, \"We are pleased to have resolved this matter from several years ago.\"\nSuch violations already present the non-crypto financial industry in a poor light, yet if there were any doubts that the non-crypto world isn't at least as poor at AML compliance as the crypto world, numerous other episodes throughout 2018 would dispel it. For example, in November, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) levelled a 30.10 million rupee fine (about $420,000) on Deutsche Bank, which had failed to observe Indian KYC and AML regulations. Also in November, French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale agreed to foot a hefty $95 million bill in order to settle charges that it had contravened U.S. AML regulations, a bill which comprised an even bigger charge of $1.34 billion for breaking U.S. trade sanctions against the likes of Cuba, Iran and Libya.\nMoreover, in December, Latvia's financial regulator levied a 1.2 million euro charge on BlueOrange Bank for AML noncompliance, while FINRA fined Swiss bank UBS $5 million for similar violations. And back in August, China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, fined five financial institutions anywhere from $100,000 to $250,000 each for falling foul of AML laws, including Ping An Bank, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank and the Bank of Communications.\nGiven that these fines were all imposed in the second half of 2018 alone, it's hard to shake the suspicion that the traditional financial industry has a serious problem with money laundering. And this is actually more than a suspicion, because a September report published by Ireland-based financial services company Fenergo revealed that, over the past 10 years, a massive $26 billion in fines had been taken from the world's banks as a result of noncompliance with AML and KYC regulations. Commenting in the report, Fenergo\u2019s director of global regulatory compliance, Laura Glynn, said that the problem isn't restricted to specific countries or banks, but is global in scope:\n\"Up until now, the focus of regulators had been on the US and European markets. However, we are now witnessing regulators in Asia Pacific and the Middle East markets becoming more proactive in their supervisory efforts.\"\nCrypto and AML\nIn contrast to what would appear to be an endemic problem in the traditional financial industry, crypto's relationship with AML legislation is tangibly less fraught. First of all, there have been far fewer cases of fines for AML and KYC violations, with crypto exchanges doing much less to attract the attention of authorities than major international banks. Apart from the $110 million civil fine demanded by FinCEN from Russian exchange BTC-e in July 2017, and the $700,000 charge also demanded by FinCEN from Ripple in May 2015, there have been no high-profile fines imposed on crypto exchanges and platforms as a result of AML noncompliance.\nOf course, the rejoinder to this point is that crypto exchanges have spent most of their lives outside the jurisdiction of the regulators responsible for AML enforcement. However, what's worth underlining here is that, since governments and financial regulators first began beating their chests about crypto and money laundering, exchanges and platforms have been racing to make themselves fully compliant with all applicable regulations.", "birthday": "2019-01-04T18:23:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-04 18:23:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 4}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nThe market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nThe first ever bitcoin was mined 10 years ago on Jan. 3, 2009. Since then, the original cryptocurrency has been on a wild ride. The naysayers continue to believe that Bitcoin is a scam and it can neither become a currency nor can act as a store of value.\nHowever, the staunch believers still maintain that one day Bitcoin will be used for everyday transactions and will also be preferred as a digital counterpart of gold. Major retail company Overstock.com has announced that it will pay its business taxes with Bitcoin.\nThough 2018 has witnessed a sharp fall in prices, it did not deter the large players from betting on digital currencies. Circle has processed 10,000 OTC trades in 2018 and generated a trade volume of $24 billion. This shows that the institutional money is gradually, if slowly, entering the space.\nThe GTI Vera Convergence Divergence indicator points to higher levels for Bitcoin if the buying pressure continues. Nigel Green, founder and CEO of United Kingdom consulting firm deVere group, expects virtual currencies to be positive in 2019, against the backdrop of increased institutional money inflow.\nHowever, what do the charts predict for the short term? Let\u2019s find out.\nBTC/USD\nThe range in Bitcoin has shrunk to $3,660.84\u2013$3,955.6 since Dec. 29. The 20-day EMA has turned flat and the RSI has dipped below 50 levels, which shows that the bulls have surrendered their momentum in the short term.\n\nThe BTC/USD pair will pick up momentum on a break out of $4,255, which will complete a head and shoulders pattern. The target of such a move is $5,500, which can extend to as high as $5,900. Therefore, traders can buy on a close above $4,255 with stops at $3,550.\nIf the bears plunge the virtual currency below $3,550, a fall to $3,236.09 will be on the cards. The downtrend will resume if this support gives way. We anticipate Bitcoin to make a decisive move within the next few days.\nETH/USD\nThe level of $167.32 has been acting as a strong resistance for the past two days. If the bulls succeed in pushing Ethereum above this level, it can rise to $225, followed by a rally to $249.93.\n\nConversely, if the ETH/USD pair turns down from the current levels, it can slide to $136.12. We anticipate a strong support at this level given that the 20-day EMA is also located close by.\nThe pair remains on track to scale $167.32 as long as it stays above the 20-day EMA. Any break of the moving averages will be a negative development that can result in a retest of $83. We recommend traders wait for a breakout above $167.32 or a dip to the support levels before initiating any long positions.\nXRP/USD\nRipple has been trading in a tight range of $0.32615\u2013$0.383 since Dec. 27. A breakdown below this range will result in a drop to $0.27795.\n\nOn the other hand, a breakout above $0.4 will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern, with the next target of $0.52205. Though the resistance line of the descending channel can act as a minor hurdle, we expect it to be crossed. Hence, we retain the buy recommendation provided in the previous analysis.\nIf the XRP/USD pair breaks out of the $0.565\u2013$0.625 zone, it will move up to $0.7644, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash could not break out of the 50-day SMA, which is a negative sign. If the price slips below $141, it can dip to the bottom of the descending channel. A breakdown of the channel will resume the downtrend.\n\nThe BCH/USD pair will pick up momentum on a break out and close (UTC time frame) above the 50-day SMA. Such a move will turn the pattern into a bullish flag that has a target of $355.\nThe flat 20-day SMA and the RSI close to the 50 level suggests a consolidation in the near term. Therefore, traders should wait for a break out of the 50-day SMA before jumping in.\nEOS/USD\nThe breakout above the 50-day SMA was short-lived. EOS has dipped back to the 20-day EMA once again. If this support breaks, the slide can extend to $2.1733.\n\nAny break of $2.1733 would be a negative development. It can result in a drop to $1.55. Below this level, the EOS/USD pair will resume its downtrend.\nOn the upside, $3.2081 is an important resistance, above which a move to $3.8723, followed by a rally to $4.493, is probable.\nXLM/USD\nThe bulls are struggling to break out of the 20-day EMA, which is a negative sign. If Stellar plunges below $0.11024826, a fall to the low of $0.09285498 is probable.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is gradually sloping down and the RSI has also slipped below 50 levels. This shows that the bears have the upper hand in the short term. The XLM/USD pair will gain strength if it breaks out of $0.15. We shall wait for a trend reversal setup to appear before proposing a trade in the pair.\nLTC/USD\nThough Litecoin broke out of the 50-day SMA on Jan. 2, it could not keep gaining ground. The bears are currently attempting to sink it below the moving averages.\n\nThe area of $27.701\u2013$29.349 is a critical support zone on the downside. Any break of this is likely to push the price down to $23.1. The downtrend will resume if this level also breaks.\nThe LTC/USD pair will pick up momentum if it breaks out of $36.428. We suggest traders wait for a close (UTC time frame) above this level to establish long positions. Until then, it is better to remain on the sidelines because the flattening moving averages and the RSI close to 50 levels point to a consolidation in the near term.\nBSV/USD\nThough the broader range in Bitcoin SV is $80.352\u2013$123.98, it has been stuck in a tight range of $80.352\u2013$102.58 since Dec. 26.\n\nUsually, when the range gets small, it is an indication of an impending breakout or breakdown. It is difficult to predict which way the chart will move when it does. Therefore, it is best to wait for the breakout before buying.\nIf the BSV/USD pair breaks out of $102.58, it can move to $123.98. If this level is also crossed, it can then rally to $167.608. Therefore, traders can buy on a close above $102.58 with the stops at $80.\nOn the other hand, if the digital currency slides below $80, it can fall further to $65.031 and below that to $38.528.\nTRX/USD\nThe bulls could not sustain the breakout on Jan. 3, but TRON has not given up ground, which suggests buying at lower levels. The 20-day EMA continues to slope up, which is a bullish sign.\n", "birthday": "2019-01-04T22:16:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-04 22:16:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 4}

Since then, the asset\u2019s price has famously been subject to volatility. That, along with the inceptive crypto\u2019s focus on decentralization, have been disturbing mainstream media, which still fails to grasp and discuss the concept of Bitcoin without skepticism \u2014 hence the omnipresent headlines exclaiming its so-called death.\nLast year was no different in regard to the FUD (i.e., fear, uncertainty and doubt) about crypto, and Bitcoin specifically \u2014 especially considering the bear\u2019s arrival. According to 99bitcoins, the virtual currency had been declared as dead at least 91 times in 2018. Here\u2019s how media and mainstream economists buried Bitcoin throughout the year, month by month.\nJan. 19\n\u201cBitcoin could be here for 100 years but it\u2019s more likely to \u2018totally collapse,\u2019 Nobel laureate says\u201d \u2014 CNBC\nBTC price: $11,721\nOn Jan. 19, when Bitcoin\u2019s price was still soaring, even after a major bounceback from its December all-time high, Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller told CNBC that Bitcoin would collapse entirely. In what now seems like an obligatory move for Bitcoin skeptics, Shiller compared the cryptocurrency to the Dutch Tulip Mania:\n\"It has no value at all unless there is some common consensus that it has value. Other things like gold would at least have some value if people didn't see it as an investment,\u201d Shiller said, adding:\n\u201cIt reminds me of the Tulip Mania in Holland in the 1640s, and so the question is did that collapse? We still pay for tulips even now and sometimes they get expensive. [Bitcoin] might totally collapse and be forgotten and I think that's a good likely outcome but it could linger on for a good long time, it could be here in 100 years.\"\n\nFeb. 11\n\u201cIs Bitcoin Heading To Zero?\u201d \u2014 Forbes\nBTC Price: $8,173\nIn February, Forbes published a more detailed investigation of the continuing Bitcoin price drop. The article focused on the main shortcomings of Bitcoin in relation to Ethereum (ETH): namely, transaction fees and governance issues.\nThe Forbes author cited PH.D. economist Eli Dourado\u2019s work on Ethereum, which highlighted that transaction costs on the Ethereum blockchain were considerably cheaper. Furthermore, the governance of Bitcoin and its ongoing development were also cited as potential issues:\n\u201cBitcoin has been unable to seriously address its on-chain scaling problems. Its community has alienated, marginalized, and purged dissenting voices, notably Mike Hearn, Gavin Andresen, and Jeff Garzik. Its core development team has been captured by an ideological faction committed to only off-chain scaling in the name of decentralization. This faction has undermined consensus scaling agreements and trashed the reputation of anyone who points out any of the above.\u201d\nMarch 5\n\u201cBitcoin is based on the blockchain pipe dream\u201d \u2014 The Guardian\nBTC price: $11,574\n\u201cOverpriced cryptocurrencies owe their diminishing credibility to an over-hyped technology,\u201d read the subtitle to the Guardian\u2019s skeptical piece on Bitcoin that was published in March. It then proceeded to argue that blockchain\u2019s effectiveness is largely overestimated, and eventually concluded:\n\u201cIt is high time to end the hype. Bitcoin is a slow energy-inefficient dinosaur that will never be able to process transactions as quickly or inexpensively as an Excel spreadsheet. Ethereum\u2019s plans for an insecure proof-of-stake authentication system will render it vulnerable to manipulation by influential insiders. And Ripple\u2019s technology for cross-border interbank financial transfers will soon be left in the dust by Swift, a non-blockchain consortium used by all of the world\u2019s major financial institutions.\u201d\nApril 24\n\u201cLet\u2019s destroy Bitcoin\u201d \u2014 MIT Technology Review\nBTC price: $9,300\nIn April, the MIT Technology Review somewhat unexpectedly invited its readers to \u201cdestroy\u201d Bitcoin, along with three scenarios in which it could allegedly be accomplished. While it\u2019s important to remember that the Technology Review is independent from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and therefore does not represent its official position, the article seemed somewhat radical and, more importantly, logically underwhelming.\nOne of the options, for instance, was a government takeover of Bitcoin with the creation of a Federal Reserve-backed coin (Fedcoin):\n\u201cThe year is two-thousand-something-big, and it\u2019s the day your taxes are due. But you don\u2019t file them. Instead an algorithm automatically makes a withdrawal from your electronic wallet, in a currency called Fedcoin.\u201d\nMay 5\n\u201cWarren Buffett says bitcoin is \u2018probably rat poison squared\u2019\u201d \u2014 CNBC\nBTC price: $9,881\nIn May, billionaire investor and vocal Bitcoin opponent Warren Buffett gave a speech at the annual meeting of his company, Berkshire Hathaway. He reiterated his negative stance toward cryptocurrencies, saying he was sure that it will come to a bad end once the craze over crypto subsided. This time, however, he added something new by saying that Bitcoin is \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s vice chairman, Charlie Munger, was quick to echo Buffet\u2019s criticism of investing in cryptocurrency, even taking it up a notch:\n\"Someone else is trading turds and you decide I can't be left out.\"\n\nJune 23\n\u201cThe Bitcoin market has finally run out of greater fools\u2026\u201d \u2014 Jordan Belfort\nBTC price: $6,139\nJordan Belfort, known colloquially as the \u201cWolf of Wall Street,\u201d criticized Bitcoin for a second time, after previously calling it \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d This time, he said in a YouTube video \u00a0that \u201dit is all based on the Great Fools Theory.\u2033\n\u201cThere\u2019s no fundamental value [with Bitcoin], it\u2019s all based on the next guy and the next guy. Get out if you don\u2019t want to lose all of your money, because [...] there\u2019s a very good chance it\u2019s going to crack. And when it really cracks, you\u2019re not going to be able to sell on the way down. There will be no liquidity.\u201d\nJuly 31\n\u201cWhy I\u2019m A Crypto Skeptic\u201d \u2014 New York Times\nBTC price: $7,830\nIn his considerably comprehensive and measured column, Times author Paul Krugman explained his skepticism regarding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nEssentially, Krugman pinpointed two shortcomings: transaction costs and the absence of tethering. He then argued that conventional monetary system works more effectively, and thereby will not be replaced by cryptocurrencies:\n\u201cIndeed, eight years after Bitcoin was launched, cryptocurrencies have made very few inroads into actual commerce. A few firms will accept them as payment, but my sense is that this is more about signaling \u2014 look at me, I\u2019m cutting-edge! \u2014 than about real usefulness. Crypocurrencies [sic] have a large market valuation, but they\u2019re overwhelmingly being held as a speculative play, not because they\u2019re useful as mediums of exchange.\u201d\nAug. 30\n\u201cBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are useless\u201d \u2014 The Economist\nBTC price: $6,862\nAs the summer was drawing to a close and the bear market started to prevail, The Economist decided to step in with a catchy headline. \u201cA decade on, it [Bitcoin] is barely used for its intended purpose,\u201d the author argued, adding:\n\u201cUsers must wrestle with complicated software and give up all the consumer protections they are used to. Few vendors accept it. Security is poor. Other cryptocurrencies are used even less.\u201d\nSept. 12\n\u201cCrypto\u2019s 80% Plunge Is Now Worse Than the Dot-Com Crash\u201d \u2014 Bloomberg\nBTC price: $6,311\nBloomberg dubbed the bear market as \u201cThe Great Crypto Crash of 2018,\u201d and drew another classic parallel akin to the tulip mania by comparing crypto with the dot-com bubble. However, it reportedly tumbled even harder: CryptoCompare Digital Assets 10 Index extended its collapse from the January high to 80 percent, which is higher than the dot-com\u2019s 78 percent peak-to-trough decline in 2000, the article reported.\n\u201cThe virtual-currency mania of 2017 -- fueled by hopes that Bitcoin would become \u201cdigital gold\u201d and that blockchain-powered tokens would reshape industries from finance to food -- has quickly given way to concerns about excessive hype, security flaws, market manipulation, tighter regulation and slower-than-anticipated adoption by Wall Street.\u201d\n\nOct. 7\n\u201cCryptocurrency is more centralized than North Korea\u201d \u2014 Nouriel Roubini, aka \u201cDr. Doom\u201d\nBTC price: $6,570\nOn Oct. 7, American economist Nouriel Roubini of New York University \u2014 known as \u201cDr. Doom\u201d for his alleged prediction of the 2008 financial crisis and also as \u201cPermabear\u201d for his market forecasts \u2014 tweeted that cryptocurrency is more centralized than North Korea, even going so far as to call Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin a dictator:\n\"Decentralization in crypto is a myth. It is a system more centralized than North Korea: miners are centralized, exchanges are centralized, developers are centralized dictators (Buterin is \"dictator for life\") & the Gini inequality coefficient of bitcoin is worse than North Korea.\"\nPreviously, in November 2017, Roubini speculated that Bitcoin would eventually fail as more countries establish stricter regulation after China\u2019s current negative approach to crypto.\nNov. 21\n\u201cJamie Dimon and Warren Buffett Have the Last Laugh on Bitcoin\u201d \u2014 Bloomberg\nBTC price: $4,542", "birthday": "2019-01-02T22:10:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-02 22:10:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 2}

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\nThe new year has started on a cautious note. Venture capital investor Fred Wilson expects crypto markets to show some \u201csigns of life\u201d this year, but he does not anticipate it to act as a safe haven. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) expects new investors to enter the asset class following the launch of Bakkt. \u00a0\nBakkt, which was created by the operator of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), has completed a $182.5 million funding round from its partners. The launch date is expected to be announced in the first quarter of 2019. The performance of the leading cryptocurrency is likely to be volatile during the launch of futures trading on Bakkt.\nThe bear market in 2018 did not spare any cryptocurrency. About 1,000 altcoins vanished last year due to various reasons. Though the media forecast Bitcoin\u2019s death about 90 times during the year, the leading cryptocurrency has managed to survive and is attempting to script another recovery. Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song expects Bitcoin to continue to outperform due to its decentralized nature.\nLet\u2019s consult the charts and see which digital currencies are making a move at the start of the year.\nBTC/USD\nBitcoin has been stuck in a tight range between $3,912.91 and $3,598.99 since Dec. 26. A breakout of this range will result in another attempt to break out of $4,255. If successful, it will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern, that has a pattern target of $5,500. Above this level, it can move up to $5,900. Short-term traders can buy on a close (UTC time frame) above $4,255, with the stop loss at $3,550.\n\nThe down sloping 50-day SMA shows that the long-term trend is down. The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is close to 50, which suggests that the short-term trend is flat. The BTC/USD pair will weaken if it slides below $3,598.99 and the downtrend will resume below $3236.09.\nETH/USD\nEthereum is trying to break out of $167.32. If successful, it can move up to $225. The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is in positive territory, which is a bullish sign.\n\nIf the bears defend $167.32, the ETH/USD pair can turn down to $136.12 and below this to the moving averages. We anticipate strong support in this zone.\nHowever, if this zone breaks down, the virtual currency can drop to $100 and below that to the low at $83. Traders can wait for a dip to the support levels to buy.\nXRP/USD\nRipple has been trading close to the 50-day SMA for the past seven days. If the bulls break out of this resistance, it can move up to $0.40. A breakout of this level will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern that has a pattern target of $0.52205 with a minor hurdle at the resistance line of the descending channel.\n\nTherefore, short-term traders can buy on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.40 with a stop loss just below $0.32.\nContrary to our expectation, if the XRP/USD pair turns down from one of the overhead resistances, it will find support at $0.33108 and below it at $0.28600. The downtrend will resume below $0.24508.\nBCH/USD\nBitcoin Cash has reached close to the top of the descending channel. The 50-day SMA is located just above the channel. Hence, we anticipate a strong resistance at this level.\n\nIf the bulls break out of the overhead resistances, it will resume the recovery that can carry the BCH/USD pair to $307.01 and $355. Therefore, short-term traders can wait for a close (UTC time frame) above the 50-day SMA to buy.\nContrary to our assumption, if the digital currency reverses from 50-day SMA, it can fall to $100. If this level also breaks, it can slump to $73.50.\nEOS/USD\nThough the bulls have kept the EOS above the 20-day EMA, they have not been able to push it higher. The overhead resistance is at the 50-day SMA and $3.2081. Above both these levels, the move can extend to $3.8723.\n\nOn the downside, if the bears sink the EOS/USD pair below the 20-day EMA, it can drop to $2.1733 and below this level, a retest of $1.55 is probable. The down-trending 50-day SMA suggests that the long-term trend is still down. In the short-term, the flat 20-day EMA and the RSI close to the midpoint points to a consolidation in the near-term.\nXLM/USD\nStellar has been clinging to the 20-day EMA for the past seven days. On the downside, the bulls have been defending $0.11024826. A breakdown of this support will result in a retest of the low at $0.09285498.\n\nIf the XLM/USD pair breaks out of $0.13427050, it can move up to $0.184, with a minor resistance at the 50-day SMA. The digital currency has been an underperformer; hence, we remain neutral on it. We shall turn positive if we find a trend reversal pattern.\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin has been trading above $29.349 for the past five days. The price is on the verge of breaking out of the 50-day SMA that can result in an attempt to break out of $36.428.\n\nA breakout will complete a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern that has a target of $49.756. Therefore, we recommend long positions on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $36.428.\nOn the other hand, if the bulls fail to break out of the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, the bears will attempt to plunge the LTC/USD pair below $28.067 that can result in a retest of the low.\nBSV/USD\nBitcoin SV continues to trade inside the $80.352\u2013 $123.98 range. It has been inside this range since Nov. 26.\n\nThe next move will start on a breakout or breakdown of the range. A breakout will extend the recovery to $167.608, whereas, a breakdown of the range can result in a retest of the low at $38.528. However, if the BSV/USD pair does not break out of the range, it will extend its consolidation. The longer the range, the stronger the eventual break from it will be.

This would also help to eradicate the need for a user to have dozens of logins, and remain secure by paying for goods and services via a single account.\nQuality and quantity\nPhantasma stresses that its plans of creating an interconnected array of DApps, where one wallet and one account is all that is needed to gain access, will not be at the cost of quality.\nOver time, the platform envisages that there will be at least eight categories that DApps will fall into \u2013 including video games, gambling, communication, video, social platforms and eCommerce. By sourcing the best DApps in each of these categories from leading blockchains, it is hoped that the blockchain-driven DApps within each of these specialties will offer benefits when compared to existing products in the marketplace today.\nIn a blog post, the team behind Phantasma wrote: \u201cWe will gradually increase the features and DApps on Phantasma Chain, which will be curated by the team and by the community. So if there is a high demand for a specific game or (D)App, we shall look into the possibilities of bringing it into our ecosystem.\u201d\nA user-friendly app\nAs well as offering a marketplace for non-fungible tokens from different chains, Phantasma says that another main advantage of its app is automatic conversions between coins and tokens, delivering access to a plethora of services even if a user doesn\u2019t own the native currencies associated with each DApp.\nThe platform\u2019s ecosystem uses the SOUL cryptocurrency for purchases \u2013 however, the startup has stressed that, thanks to these automatic conversions, customers who don\u2019t hold this coin will be able to pay using the likes of Ethereum or Bitcoin if they prefer.", "birthday": "2019-01-03T07:29:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-03 07:29:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 3}

On his P2P Foundation profile \u2014 which went inactive in late 2010 \u2014 Nakamoto identifies as a 43-year-old male who lives in Japan, but he almost never posted on the Bitcoin forum during local daytime. Other clues, like the British spelling of words like \u201ccolour\u201d and \u201coptimise,\u201d suggest he was of Commonwealth origin.\nSo far, the media and community have come up with numerous results of who might be the real Satoshi, none of which have been confirmed. On June 14, 2018 the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) said that it could \u201cneither confirm nor deny the existence\u201d of Nakamoto after a Motherboard journalist requested information on his identity through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\nHere\u2019s the (incomplete) list of potential candidates.\n\nVili Lehdonvirta\nSuspect credentials: a 38 year-old Finnish professor at the Helsinki Institute for Information Technology\nSource: Joshua Davis, The New Yorker\nOne of the first attempts to reveal Satoshi\u2019s identity dates back to October 2011, when journalist Joshua Davis wrote a piece for the New Yorker. During his quest to identify the Bitcoin creator, Davis found Michael Clear, a young graduate student in cryptography at Trinity College in Dublin, who had worked at Allied Irish Banks to improve its currency-trading software and co-authored an academic paper on peer-to-peer technology. Clear denied he was Satoshi, but offered the journalist the name of \u201ca solid fit for Nakamoto\u201d \u2014 a thirty-one-year-old Finnish researcher at the Helsinki Institute for Information Technology named Vili Lehdonvirta, who used to be a video game programmer and studied virtual currencies.\nHowever, after being contacted by Davis, Lehdonvirta also claimed he was not Satoshi. \u201cYou need to be a crypto expert to build something as sophisticated as bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many of those people, and I\u2019m definitely not one of them.\u201d\n\nShinichi Mochizuki\nSuspect credentials: a 49 year-old Japanese mathematician at Kyoto University\nSource: Ted Nelson\nOn May 17, 2013, American IT pioneer, sociologist and philosopher Ted Nelson suggested that Nakamoto could be Japanese mathematician Shinichi Mochizuki of Kyoto University, who worked mostly in number theory and geometry. Nelson\u2019s evidence was largely circumstantial, however, as it mostly rested on how Mochizuki released his solution to the ABC Conjecture, one of the biggest unsolved problems in mathematics.\nA few days later, Nelson told Quartz that he would donate to charity if Mochizuki denied being Satoshi Nakamoto:\n\u201cIf that person denies being Satoshi, I will humbly give one bitcoin (at this instant worth about $123) to any charity he selects. If he is Satoshi and denies it, at least he will feel guilty. (One month time limit on denial\u2013 bitcoins are going UP.)\u201d\nIn July 2013, The Age reported that Mochizuki denied Nelson\u2019s claims, but did not specify the source.\n\nDorian Nakamoto\nSuspect credentials: a 68-year-old Japanese American man who has done classified work for major corporations and the U.S. military\nSource: Leah McGrath Goodman, Newsweek\nOn March 6, 2014, Newsweek published a lengthy article written by journalist Leah McGrath Goodman, who identified Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, a Japanese American male living in California as the original Bitcoin creator.\nGoodman learned that Nakamoto worked as a systems engineer on classified defense projects and computer engineer for technology and financial information services companies. Nakamoto reportedly turned libertarian after being laid off from his job twice in the early 1990s.\nThere were other clues besides his birth name. Goodman argues that Nakamoto confirmed his identity as the Bitcoin founder after she asked him about the cryptocurrency during a face-to-face interview. \"I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it,\u201d he allegedly replied. \u201cIt's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.\"\nHowever, in a following full-length interview with The Associated Press, Dorian Nakamoto denied all connection to Bitcoin. He said that he had never heard of it before, and that he thought that Goodman was asking about his previous work for military contractors, which was largely classified. Interestingly, in a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" interview, he stated he had misinterpreted Goodman's question as being related to his work for Citibank. Later on the same day, the Nakamoto's P2P Foundation account posted its first message in several years, stating: \"I am not Dorian Nakamoto.\"\n\nNick Szabo\nSuspect credentials: (supposedly) a 55 year-old American man of Hungarian descent and creator of BitGold, a predecessor of Bitcoin\nSources: Skye Grey, researcher; Dominic Frisby, financial writer\nIn December 2013, researcher Skye Grey published results of his stylometric analysis, which indicated that the person behind Satoshi Nakamoto was a computer scientist and cryptographer named Nick Szabo.\nEssentially, Grey searched for unusual turns of phrase and vocabulary patterns \u201cin particular places which you would expect a cryptography researcher to contribute to,\u201d and then \u201cevaluated the fitness of each match found by running textual similarity metrics on several pages of their writing.\u201d\nSzabo is a decentralized currency enthusiast who developed the concept of \"BitGold,\" a pre-Bitcoin, privacy-focused digital currency, back in 1998. In his May 2011 article on Bitcoin, Szabo wrote:\n\"Myself, Wei Dai, and Hal Finney were the only people I know of who liked the idea (or in Dai's case his related idea) enough to pursue it to any significant extent until Nakamoto (assuming Nakamoto is not really Finney or Dai).\"\nAdditional research carried out by financial author Dominic Frisby, which he describes in his 2014 book titled \u201cBitcoin: The Future of Money?\u201d also suggests that Nick Szabo is the real Satoshi. In an interview on Russia Today, Frisby said: \"I've concluded there is only one person in the whole world that has the sheer breadth but also the specificity of knowledge and it is this chap [Nick Szabo].\"\nNevertheless, Szabo has denied being Satoshi. In a July 2014 email to Frisby, he reportedly stated:\n\u201cThanks for letting me know. I'm afraid you got it wrong doxing me as Satoshi, but I'm used to it.\u201d\n\nHal Finney\nSuspect credentials: an American cryptographic pioneer who died in 2014 at the age of 58\nSource: Andy Greenberg, Forbes (who eventually denied his own assumption)\nOn March 25, 2014, Forbes journalist Andy Greenberg published an article on Dorian Nakamoto\u2019s alleged neighbor, a pre-Bitcoin cryptographic pioneer named Hal Finney, who received the very first BTC transaction from Nakamoto.\nInterestingly, Greenberg reached out to the writing analysis consultancy Juola & Associates and asked them to compare a sample of Finney's writing to that of Satoshi Nakamoto. Reportedly, they found that it was the closest resemblance they had yet come across \u2014 including the other candidates suggested by Newsweek, Fast Company and New Yorker journalists, along with Ted Nelson and Skye Grey. However, the company established that Nakamoto's emails to Finney more closely resemble the style that the original white paper was written in when compared to Finney's emails.\nGreenberg suggested that Finney may have been a ghostwriter for Nakamoto, or that he used his neighbor Dorian's identity as cover. Finney denied he was Satoshi. Greenberg, after meeting Finney in person, seeing the email exchanges between him and Nakamoto, and his Bitcoin wallet's history, concluded that Finney was telling the truth.\nOn Aug. 28, 2014, Hal Finney died at his home in Phoenix at the age of 58 after five years of battling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\nCraig Wright\nSuspect credentials: a 48 year-old Australian computer scientist and businessman\nSources: Andy Greenberg, Gwern Branwen, Wired; Craig Wright (himself)\nOn Dec. 8, 2015, Wired published an article written by Andy Greenberg and Gwern Branwen that argued an Australian academic named Craig Steven Wright \"either invented bitcoin or is a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did.\"\nOn the same day, Gizmodo ran a story that featured documents allegedly obtained by a hacker who broke into Wright's email accounts, claiming that Satoshi Nakamoto was a joint pseudonym for Craig Steven Wright and his friend, computer forensics analyst and cyber-security expert David Kleiman, who died in 2013.\nWright promptly took down his online accounts and disappeared for several months until May 2, 2016, when he publicly declared that he is the creator of Bitcoin. Later on the same month, Wright published an apology along with a refusal to publish the proof of access to one of the earliest Bitcoin keys. Cointelegraph has published several articles on why Wright is most likely not Satoshi. Nevertheless, Wright continues to claim that he is Satoshi to this day.\nIn February 2018, the estate of Dave Kleiman filed a lawsuit against Wright over the rights to $5 billion worth of BTC, claiming that Wright defrauded Kleiman of virtual currency and intellectual property rights.\n\nNeal King, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry\nSuspects credentials: U.S. and German residents, occupancy and age unknown\nSource: Adam Penenberg, Fast Company\nIn October 2013, journalist Adam Penenberg penned an article for Fast Company, where he cited circumstantial evidence suggesting that Neal King, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry could be Nakamoto. King and Bry reportedly live in Germany while Oksman was claimed to be based in the U.S.\nPenenberg\u2019s theory revolves around the claim that King, Oksman and Bry jointly filed a patent application that contained the phrase \"computationally impractical to reverse\" in August 2008, which was also used in the white paper published by Nakamoto in October that year. Moreover, the domain name bitcoin.org was registered three days after the patent was filed.\nAll three men denied being Nakamoto when contacted by Penenberg.\n\nElon Musk", "birthday": "2019-01-03T08:50:00+00:00", "date": "2019-01-03 08:50:00", "year": 2019, "month": 1, "day": 3}
