Impossibility to steal, change or delete registered data makes platforms built using this magic technology the most secure business solution.\nDriving business with smart contracts\nEarlier this year, the Bank of Russia has introduced Masterchain, an Ethereum-based Blockchain prototype created specifically to serve the interests of financial market actors. Alfa Bank, along with Sberbank, Qiwi, Banks Tinkoff and Otkritie, was one of the contributors to this newly developed and tested platform.\nAlfa Bank finds Blockchain to be the ideal solution for business structures involving plenty of partners. Therefore, financial players have actively been developing and testing the potentials of this technology.\nRecently, Alfa Bank has collaborated with S7 Airlines to test an execution of service payment transactions using smart contracts deploying Blockchain technology.\nAlfa Bank provided the participants of the deal with special facilities through its Alfa-Business Online electronic system. Using this system the customer applies for the opening of the letter of credit, and the contractor then submits all necessary documentation upon finalizing of service delivery to the bank. Once the application for opening the letter of credit has been submitted, funds can be withdrawn from the customer\u2019s account and first transferred to a special transition account and later to the contractor\u2019s account.\nKey steps of the deal \u2013 opening and closing of the letter of credit \u2013 have been performed as transactions deploying smart contracts using the Ethereum platform, and were registered in the distributed ledger. Records in the distributed ledger contain a hash of the following information: deal\u2019s identification codes, type of services, and terms and conditions. This allows for all participants of the deal to check its status at any time.\nBringing more transparency\nUsing two smart-contracts simultaneously is a distinctive feature of the deal: one was used only for initiating the letter of credit and the other for completing it. Deployment of two interacting smart contracts is intended to reduce the potential for code errors and therefore protects the interests of the parties of the deal improving its transparency.\nNadezhda Avdanina, Head of the Center for innovations at Alfa Bank commented:", "birthday": "2016-12-31T12:45:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-31 12:45:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 31}

After a stretch in which the price of Bitcoin held relatively stable, the world\u2019s first and most famous cryptocurrency has been skyrocketing! Bitcoin saw an annual gain of nearly 54 percent this year, outperforming all fiat currencies, most of which stumbled in 2016. \u00a0\nSo what\u2019s behind the recent surge? Cointelegraph reached out to some of the world\u2019s thought leaders in the industry to get their opinion and predictions for the upcoming year.\nWorld economy troubles - Bitcoin prospers\nBitcoin\u2019s outstanding performance this year has been driven by various factors including, experts acknowledging the \u201chalvening,\u201d the troubling world economy represented by fiat chaos in India\u00a0and Venezuela, as well as a slowing Chinese economy and a depreciating yuan.\nNicolas Cary, co-founder of Blockchain, says:\n \u201cThe price performance of Bitcoin has closely tracked some macroeconomic trends including the dramatic fall in the value of the British Pound, Argentine Peso and Venezuelan Bolivar. At Blockchain, we have seen very strong growth the past quarter across our entire platform but especially on the wallet side. The company expects to hit 11 mln wallets by Dec. 31.\u201d \u00a0 \nAccording to Gavin Smith, CEO at First Global Credit, 2016 was indeed the year when the Bitcoin capital market really started to establish itself and provide holders of the cryptocurrency with various ways to generate a return on their assets - much more than the other cryptocurrencies.\nSmith says:\n \u201cBecause of this development, holders of Bitcoin and miners have been less inclined to dump their coins on the market and have instead started to use these assets to generate additional returns - often higher returns than can be achieved with conventional currencies.\u201d \nAccording to Smith, this improvement in the ecosystem has coincided with a loss of confidence in currencies from many smaller developing countries - a development that has seen people move some of their assets into Bitcoin to protect themselves from any potential devaluation. As a result, the combination of this reduced supply with increased demand has facilitated this year\u2019s growth. Smith believes that this trend will continue throughout 2017 and onward.\nA chance for Bitcoin to step in and create trust\nOn another note, increasing political instability could also serve as an impetus for Bitcoin\u2019s rising success.\nErik Vollst\u00e4dt from Bitnation says:\n \u201cWe are seeing more and more political crisis in the world. Take, for example, Brexit, Trump's election, the refugee crisis in Europe and the associated fear of Islamism as well as right-wing terrorism. Every government failure is an opportunity for Bitcoin to step in and create trust instead.\u201d \nA safe haven?\nBitcoin is often considered as a safe asset. When the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and the major European indices stumble, Bitcoin steps in as an attractive diversifier, as it does not correlate with the stock market and is not tied to any single country\u2019s policy decisions. That is indeed a great advantage in times of political and economic uncertainty.\nNicolas Cary says:\n \u201cBitcoin is a convenient hedge for people who want to de-risk from traditional currencies. However, being safe from the whims of banks and governments, Bitcoin is still not totally immune from volatility.\u201d \nSpeaking of it as a store of value, Bitcoin is measurably safer than it was 12 or even six months ago, however, the Bitcoin capital market is still in the early phase of development and, therefore, volatility remains a very real possibility.\nGavin Smith says:\n \u201cIn terms of cryptocurrency alternatives, we believe that Bitcoin is by far the gold standard. The capital market ecosystem is the most well developed and the investment options available to Bitcoin holders are greater than any other crypto asset class.\u201d \nIn terms of global assets, Bitcoin certainly has its place but this should be as part of a mixed portfolio - it's much easier to sustain the inevitable drawdowns in the value of Bitcoin if you are also invested in other assets that may be generating positive returns.\nWe love Bitcoin for Blockchain!\nDavid Li from Onchain believes that there is a deeper reason behind Bitcoin\u2019s success this year, which is far from the geopolitical and economic implications of recent global events.\nHe says:\n \u201cThere is an undeniable and irreversible trend: the research and application of Bitcoin's underlying technology. Mainstream can no longer belittle Bitcoin's greatness since they will be joining us in following this trend, exemplified by numerous reports of central banks' interests in digitized fiat and private sector investment on Blockchains.\u201d \nIndeed, Blockchain technology, which powers Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has come to the fore in many finance firms\u2019 agendas because of its potential to upgrade business processes and increase their efficiency.\nOperating as a distributed ledger, Blockchain allows multiple parties to store and transfer sensitive information in a space that is secure, permanent, anonymous and easily accessible.\nSimplifying traditionally paper-heavy, expensive and logistically complicated processes, Blockchain technology can potentially cut costs by up to $20 bln annually by 2022, according to Santander.\nOver 50 major financial institutions are nowadays involved with collaborative Blockchain startups, having begun researching the technology in-house, or having helped fund startups with products rooted in Blockchain.\nTowards greater understanding of the magic of Bitcoin\nBitcoin, as well as its core technology Blockchain, have been getting more coverage and media exposure this year. More and more people get inspired by the idea of having a more inclusive and borderless currency.\nNo doubts, there is still a lot to be done on this path, but educating and socializing Bitcoin will certainly help this insufficiently understood innovation enter the public consciousness. The fact that Bitcoin has been operating for seven years now without errors or being hacked can certainly solidify trust in Bitcoin as well.\nErik Vollst\u00e4dt says:\n \u201cIt has proven not to be a Ponzi scheme and to be able to work on its initial volatility problems. We are seeing organic growth now compared to the bubbles of 2012.\u201d \nWhat 2017 brings for Bitcoin?\nAs we are now on the verge of a new year, it is probably only natural to think of what 2017 will look like for Bitcoin. Exactly one year ago, Daniel Masters, co-founder of Jersey-based Global Advisors' multi-million dollar Bitcoin hedge fund, estimated that the price of Bitcoin would make it above $1,100 in 2016 and then pick up speed to rise to $4,400 by the end of 2017. Well, it seems that getting to these numbers is not that impossible.\nConsidering where we are now, and what we have, where do we go from here? Experts believe that Bitcoin\u2019s continued growth will depend on the factors that have so far contributed to its success.\nIn 2016 we have seen an increased acceptance of payments in Bitcoin by big companies and authorities and a spate of new Bitcoin products.\nNicolas Cary says:\n \u201cBitcoin stands to make healthy gains as firms improve the applications that regular users rely on. At Blockchain, we're focused on making it simple and easy for regular people to use Bitcoin. In fact, users across Europe in 34 countries can now buy and sell Bitcoin with ease instantly. It's the fastest and most convenient way to get started. The recent gains will further stress the need for the technical community to implement scaling solutions as more people rely on the network to conduct economic activity.\u201d \nBitcoin has gone all the way from a simple token of exchange to a genuine store of value. The Bitcoin market has resisted the Bitfinex hack in the third quarter of 2016 and re-established its upward trajectory pretty quickly after that.\nGavin Smith believes this trend will continue in 2017, and the driver for this will be new innovations that are being released that will certainly enhance the value of the Bitcoin capital market.

In addition to what appears to be a demand spike caused by global macro worries, the price action since the breakout above $700 has been indicative of a supply shock as a result of the halving. \u00a0Not only that but despite what has been overbought momentum for the past month or so, the remainder of the technicals are signaling that a continuation to the upside is likely to occur over the coming weeks.\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the three-day chart once again as it remains highly relevant for the medium to long term outlook. \u00a0We can see that the price took an unorthodox route higher by breaking out above the rising wedge, which is typically a bearish pattern sparking the move we are still currently in the middle of. \u00a0Additionally, we can gauge how bullish the market is by how quickly it ripped up through the long term OTE short zone, as seen in the red box, which in this instance was very fast. \u00a0Also note that the price has already broken above the top of the said OTE zone, which tells us that in the not too distant future there is more room to run to the upside. \u00a0\nMoving on to momentum and volume, notice that RSI and the Stochastic are both officially overbought now, the PPO is starting to paint some weak sell signals, and we are pretty far extended above the 200-period SMA. \u00a0Not only that, but the volume profile remains very thin all the way down to around the $500 level and exchange volumes have yet to break to new highs. \u00a0Conversely, MACD looks very good as it accelerates higher, the A/D line continues its steady uptrend, and market structure is undeniably bullish, all of which confirms the potential for significantly more upside following a recharge of a momentum of some kind. \u00a0", "birthday": "2016-12-28T15:40:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-28 15:40:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 28}

The developers hope to start a \u201cdigital cryptocurrency transformation\u201d, by creating a coin which is exceptionally friendly to a first-time user and is run by a legitimate company, to facilitate cooperation with the government. \nThe Wild West of cryptos \nGovernment regulation and usability have been hot topics in the cryptocurrency industry since its very inception. Whenever a question is raised as to whether the cryptocurrencies and businesses which make use of them should be regulated by the government, and to what extent, it seems to spark a heated debate, with people arguing for widely different positions, ranging from complete integration into the legal field, to the absence of any kind of regulation. \nThe situation is similarly ambiguous when it comes to usability. While some coins, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, provide their users with many high-quality tools for sending, receiving and spending their money due to the sheer size and engagement of their communities, other, less popular ones, sometimes don\u2019t even have GUI wallets, which makes them barely usable for crypto newbies. \nGiracoin\u2019s developers aim to somewhat rectify this confusion and create a more understandable concept of cryptocurrency in the eyes of any lay person, by solidifying ties with the authorities and creating a coin which is exceptionally user-friendly, not only for the experienced people but also for the first-timers. \nA new sheriff in town \nGira Financial Group AG, the company in charge of developing Giracoin, is an official Swiss intermediary and is a part of the SRO organization, which means that it is fully compliant with the financial regulations of its home country and is constantly in the state of close cooperation with the government. \nThe company plans not only to develop the cryptocurrency itself, but also various services which will significantly increase its usabilities, such as Girabuy.com - an e-commerce platform for merchants who accept the coin, and Girapay - an e-wallet and Giracoin payment service provider. \nIn addition, Giracoin crowdsources its marketing, by allowing any engaged user to help spread the word about the cryptocurrency, and make money in the process. This way, potential new users will hear about the coin from their trusted friends and acquaintances, as opposed to any impersonal and inefficient advertisement. \nRaja, the CTO of Gira Financial Group AG, told us about Giracoin\u2019s plans, goals and tools for achieving them: \nCointelegraph: What is the overarching goal of Giracoin? What does your team hope to achieve in the long-run? \nRaja: We believe in independent currencies and Bitcoin has done a great job as a proof-of-concept, but to really have an independent cryptocurrency which can be used with all the advantages that it could provide, one needs acceptance not only from the users but also from the authorities. \nSo in the long-run Giracoin should become the accepted cryptocurrency by the users and the authorities which facilitate the use of digital currency. \nThat said, Giracoin itself is the current aim and tool that Gira Financial Group AG uses to build trust and acceptance in digital currency for daily users. But in the long-run, with products likeGirabuy.com - an easy to use e-commerce platform for merchants who accept Giracoin, and Girapay/GiraApp - an e-wallet and Giracoin payment service provider - and numerous other services bound to Giracoin which are in development, we aim for the digital transformation of the Giracoin to real-world goods and services. \nCT: What are Giracoin's major advantages, when compared to other cryptocurrencies? \nR: When you talk about cryptocurrencies, we only consider the ones with a public block explorer. From our point of view, nowadays it is necessary to have a central office behind every cryptocurrency. In fact, you can't transfer large amounts of Bitcoins without knowing your customer, which results in the original idea of having anonymity and transparency not being there anyway. \nOur advantage is in the fact that we aim for a real digital transformation, by creating an easily usable coin with all the advantages, e.g. fast transactions, making traceable paths of a transaction fraud proof, just to mention a few. And whether you can mine directly or not doesn't matter, what matters is that even a layman is able to enjoy the advantages of a cryptocurrency. \nFor this vision of an easy to use currency, we need projects like Giracoin, and the fact that Gira Financial Group AG is authorized to be a financial intermediary as a member of the SRO proves that we take care of the compliance for Giracoin users. \nGira Financial Group AG actively endeavors to create a real value around Giracoin with launching platforms likeGirabuy.com andGirapay.com. Also, with our implementation of Proof-of-Stake, we have a similar pattern to that of the current FIAT currencies, which people are used to. So with Giracoin we level towards a future where cryptocurrencies become a part of everyday life, and we help everybody to undergo this digital transformation. \nCT: Do you have much experience in the cryptocurrency industry? What are some other major projects your team members have worked on? \nR: Our team consists of experienced members in the field of economy, law, project management and consulting and software engineering. Especially our coin development team has worked on several cryptocurrencies and implementations of the basic underlying layer the Blockchain, including extended features of such Blockchain implementations. \nBesides being involved in all the cutting edge development and improvement of Bitcoin Blockchain and Giracoin Blockchain, our team is also working on other solutions, like smart contracts and other exciting features the Blockchain has to offer. \nSo the team is well experienced in the industry of cryptocurrency and how to create a real value for such a digital product. \nCT: Let's address the elephant in the room: the lack of an open-sourced Blockchain, coupled with a heavy focus on multi-level marketing can be a red flag for many in the cryptocurrency community. Working in an industry which values transparency above almost everything else, what is your reasoning behind keeping your Blockchain private?

Creating digital money would be easier than printing paper money since it doesn\u2019t involve expensive processes like printing. \nDisadvantages\n Problems for the elderly with difficulties adapting to the new changes and reticent to \"touch\" their savings.

Those who did not have an Internet strategy in the late 1990s were probably on the wrong side of the revolution curve. We have recently entered a new phase of technology development and the question everyone should be asking themselves is: what is the Blockchain strategy?\n2016 was the year when the potential of Blockchain to revolutionize many industries began to be fully understood. The technology, that is said to change the world just like the Internet did, is being widely discussed. Only the laziest haven\u2019t at least Googled what it\u2019s all about.\nDigital world is a part of our DNA\nLet\u2019s go back a little bit to Slush 2016, where some of the key thought leaders in the space of Blockchain shared their views on what the decentralized future will look like.\nNicolas Cary, co-founder of Blockchain, says:\n \u201cThe digital world is part of our DNA now, it\u2019s a part of how we share experiences, how we keep in touch with our loved ones and how we consume our entertainment. Why can\u2019t money be digital too? It\u2019s best not to have our heads stuck in the sand on this issue.\u201d \n    \nIt is crazy indeed that many trillion dollar financial industries have not yet been fundamentally transformed by technology. It appears that they hold no imagination for how things could be better. Transaction networks require three things to function: a currency, a settlement with a high degree of certainty and a ledger to keep track of who owns what. Banks have built centralized ledgers for a very long time. In essence, these ledgers are databases of accounts that are all kept in one place. While it is supposed to facilitate transactions, these financial transactions are still not an easy task to perform.\nBlockchain has done a lot in the past 12 months, revolutionizing the way we transact.\n\u201cAs a phenomenon Blockchain is rather abstract, it is hard to describe it in a few words, as it is so unlike the other technologies,\u201d says Paul Puey from Airbitz.\n\u201cBlockchain is an incredibly important development in computer science and it\u2019s going to fundamentally change the way the Internet functions and the way we interact and transact with each other,\u201d says Nicolas Cary. \u201cThe best way to think of it is that it\u2019s a ledger, but instead of being in one place it\u2019s actually in a cloud. One can think of it as a spreadsheet in a cloud, which is globally replicated and distributed all over the world, and when an update happens in one place it happens in all those places simultaneously.\u201d\nYou can be your own bank\nThe first thing that has been tested on the Blockchain is money, but it\u2019s not the most important thing. Blockchain runs transactions 24/7, 365 days a year, as it doesn\u2019t know what a bank holiday is and it has been running without error for nearly seven and a half years - any bank can be jealous of that.\nCryptocurrencies are gaining in popularity at a higher speed than ever before. For instance, as a risk asset Bitcoin has been particularly interesting in the past year. We\u2019ve seen incredible volatility in markets in Venezuela, Brazil, Greece and Ukraine.\nIn times of global volatility, Bitcoin as an asset class is definitely overperforming. The exciting thing is that more and more people realize they no longer need a bank to perform financial transactions, as they can be their own bank and send money anywhere in the world in just one click, costing a few cents in transaction fees.\nHow would the decentralized Internet look?\nBlockchain has moved us away from the original client-server logic, and the potential of Blockchain to also move the decentralized Internet forward is indeed huge. Furthermore, it\u2019s not only about digital currencies as this is just one of the numerous applications of this technology.\nYou have a database that\u2019s an immutable record keeping system - a big spreadsheet that nobody can change, but everyone can write to - that can serve as a basis for a global property right system.\nJutta Steiner from Ethcore says:\n \u201cI am really excited about non-financial use cases of Blockchain. Take a look for example at supply chains where a lot of information has to be transferred between many different actors. How do you make sure that the product you buy in the shop is authentic? Blockchain could be this tool that would allow to sent this strong financial signals, or information to all participants of the network. This tool in proving the authenticity of products really works, and it makes businesses so much cheaper, faster and significantly simplifies all key processes.\u201d \n    \nMany things can be tracked with a system built on Blockchain - diamonds, artwork, land, stocks and bonds. There are also many companies that are currently tackling these issues. Blockchain indeed brings a good deal of transparency to places that need it desperately.\nBlockchain can't do everything\nAs more and more use-cases for this magic technology occur, the understanding that Blockchain cannot yet solve every issue becomes clearer. The technology provides everyone with an out of the box organizational structure that everyone can use, but it is not a panacea to every problem. Obviously, you can\u2019t put your dog on Blockchain or brew a coffee with it.\nJutta Steiner says:\n \u201cDisappointment might mostly come from the fact that it might take longer for a technology to mature. In other cases, I think it is a very powerful tool to redesign the Web.\u201d ", "birthday": "2016-12-30T10:10:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-30 10:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 30}

Bitcoin experts believe that the current trend of an upward adjustment for the pioneer cryptocurrency will continue unabated in 2017.\nRoger Ver, also known as Bitcoin Jesus, and owner of Bitcoin.com holds the belief that there is good reason to think that 2017 will be the best year for Bitcoin. In an interview with Cointelegraph, the astute crypto investor was very optimistic that the best thing that ever happened to Bitcoin will occur in 2017.\nBitcoin ETF in 2017?\nFor a couple of years now, the Crypto Community is eagerly waiting for the green light for a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) to usher Bitcoin into the financial mainstream. However, this has been elusive even though not impossible. It will be recalled that the Winklevoss twins filed for an ETF with the SEC in mid-2013.\nMany are of the view that if ETF becomes a reality in 2017, the industry will see the best of its times. Nevertheless, others are of the opinion that this won\u2019t see the light of the day. Yet Roger firmly believes this will be possible in 2017, and it will lead to unprecedented positive consequences for Bitcoin.\n \u201cIt has been possible from day one, but the regulators have delayed it, and denied the ability of mln of people to easily participate in the Bitcoin economy via financial instruments that they are already familiar with.\u201d \nBlocksize challenges\nThe biggest trial for Bitcoin at the moment and something that saw an intense discussion with passion throughout 2016 is the Bitcoin blocksize. Alas, just a few days to end the year and no concrete agreements are in sight. A slow transaction is pushing many people and businesses to integrate alternative cryptocurrencies.\nTo Roger Ver whether a hard fork in 2017 is possible is a tough question to answer. \u201cThis is the $15 bln question. I wish I had a definite answer for you, but we just don\u2019t know yet. It is also worth noting that a hard fork is just another name for a protocol upgrade,\u201d the Bitcoin early adopter humorously pointed out.\nEven though the community has optimistic expectations for Bitcoin in the coming year, the fact remains that the issue of the block size is still retrogressive to the ecosystem.

Even small amounts of Bitcoin have made people incredibly wealthy. In December of 2015, The Guardian reported the case of Kristoffer Koch, a Norwegian who had purchased Bitcoin worth $26.60 in 2009. Koch acquired a total of 5000 Bitcoins for his investment, which at last year\u2019s rate was worth $886,000.\nLet us fast forward to today and Kristoffer\u2019s investment would be worth $4,749,550.\nLet\u2019s follow Mr. Koch and try to see if we can recognize some patterns that can allow you to become a Bitcoin millionaire as well.\nHold on to all your coins stupid\nThe first rule of any investment is to buy and hold. Even the legendary Mr. Koch sold some of his holdings according to The Guardian:\n \u201cKoch exchanged one-fifth of his 5,000 Bitcoins, generating enough kroner to buy an apartment in Toyen, one of the Norwegian capital\u2019s wealthier areas.\u201d \nIf we think about Bitcoin, it has at least doubled in value since January 2016 to December 2016. Who would not be tempted to cash in some of their gains and make a quick buck and spend it on a holiday or buy their dream house?\nThis is understandable as it is difficult for people to put off the pursuit of happiness if they can pursue it today. This is a great challenge, not only for Bitcoin investors but almost everyone holding an asset. It would be completely foolhardy though not to take some profits now and then, but you should hold on to the majority of your Bitcoin if you do intend to take advantage of the gains in the currency.\nRemember Koch, even he forgot about the Bitcoin he had purchased nearly six years prior. It is best that you forget about your holdings and have patience as well if you want to make some serious money.\nKeep them safe\nIf you have Bitcoin, remember to keep them safe.\nHere are some ideas\u00a0on how to do that. Remember, do not keep your wealth lying around with other people, such as in an exchange hot wallet. Save Bitcoin in a wallet whose private keys you control. Better still, invest in a hardware wallet.\nAlso, make sure that you have a trustworthy person who has access to your Bitcoin, so that if something happens to your mortal frame, at least your heirs can benefit. This is elementary stuff. Don\u2019t lose your money and the more value that Bitcoin gains, the higher the chances that you may become a victim of theft.\nLet us go back to the case of Koch, who forgot his password and nearly lost access to all his fabulous wealth. Remember your passwords people and keep your Bitcoin safe.\nHow much Bitcoin will make you a millionaire", "birthday": "2016-12-30T14:15:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-30 14:15:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 30}

ChainThat is one of the companies to watch.\nI caught up with two of the founders, Vikas Acharya and David Edwards, at an InsurTech industry dinner and asked them:\nCT: What inroads are you making in the London insurance market?\nDavid Edwards: We have a number of proof of concepts with insurers and things are picking up, but the bulk of the London insurance market has yet to embrace Blockchain.\nCT: What makes you think ChainThat may succeed with insurers?\nVikas Acharya: We designed our stack to allow industries - insurers, in this case - to rapidly test and prototype Blockchain-based services. We try to make complex technologies easier to use and to experiment with. We spend a lot of our time educating customers and focus on real-world projects that can be put into live production environments and scale up quickly.\nDE: We were the first to get working prototypes for commercial specialty reinsurance and have a working approach available.

Simple, immutable and autonomous applications, basically. As Primavera de Filippi eloquently phrased it during her talk at OuiShare Paris 2016 \u201cSmart Contracts are neither smart nor contracts...\u201d. But ironically, smart contracts are however ideally suited to be\u2026 well\u2026 contracts!\nIn essence, your contract, whether it\u2019s a marriage contract or a freelance gig contract, becomes a self-executing application. The contract goes from being a static agreement to a living application. That\u2019s tremendously exciting.\nWhat really turned me onto it was reading the \u201cLex Cryptographia\u201d blog post by Justin Ranvier back in 2013, that\u2019s when I realized the Blockchain, and smart contract technology more specifically, could be used to replace the government in its core function: security and dispute resolution. That is why we are building Pangea, an Ethereum smart contract powered peer-to-peer jurisdiction, based on the Secure Scuttlebutt communication protocol.\nCointelegraph: How exactly do Smart Contracts add value to businesses?\nSusanne Tarkowski:\n I believe in the near future, two to three years, smart contracts will diminish costs of legal advice, notarization and dispute resolution by 99 percent at the very minimum for businesses who choose to adopt it, although it might slightly increase the cost of coders and code vetting services. \nCointelegraph: Have Smart Contracts in the commercial realm been proven yet?\nSusanne Tarkowski: Yes, for tasks like escrow accounts, gambling, predictions, etc.\nAt Bitnation, we have used it for our own organizational structure - a DAO like contract called Decentralized Borderless Voluntary Nation (DBVN) - and we haven\u2019t had any problems to date.

NameCoin set out to solve this vulnerability by creating a distributed domain name registration system, unable to be taken down through centralized control. However, due to various developmental flaws, NameCoin never reached more than a historical and novelty significance.\nBipCoin aims to successfully rectify this shortcoming. A CryptoNote-based cryptocurrency, \u00a0which recently released a graphical user interface (GUI) wallet before more popular CryptoNote coin Monero, BipCoin aims to add decentralized DNS functionality, solving the many issues that prevented NameCoin from catching on, including domain squatting. Its development team has released a plain-English whitepaper as well as a fundraiser to add distributed DNS functionality.\nCointelegraph spoke to Michael Dean, BipCoin developer, about the future of censorship-proof domains.\nCointelegraph: So first, why is decentralized \"DNS\" important?\nMichael W. Dean: Governments control DNS, and it is the easiest way for them to steal a website they don't like, even if it is not breaking the law, and there is very little recourse when that happens to you.\nCointelegraph: NameCoin attempted this, correct? Were they successful, and if not, why?\nMichael W. Dean: A number of reasons. Mainly they made it almost free to register a domain, so they all got squatted, and five years later they still don't really have a way for the non-technical to resolve a NameCoin domain (Dot-Bit). There was FreeSpeechMe, a plugin that I named and promoted for the NameCoin team, and raised money for, it was a start, but came out three years after their launch. Then there was MeowBit, that I also named, which BipCoin Dev team member Derrick Slopey made and we worked really hard to promote that, but the underlying framework of NameCoin was broken in the ways I described above. This was two years ago. I've been thinking non-stop since about how to do it, and I really think I've solved all the issues. And enumerated the plan in the whitepaper.\nIt may seem that the BipDev writing this whitepaper has it out to bash NameCoin and the NameCoin devs. However, there is no possible way to accurately explain what was wrong with NameCoin, and what to do right in moving distributed DNS beyond NameCoin, without mentioning the many many mistakes of the NameCoin devs.\nDistributed DNS is one of the things always mentioned in any introductory article about \"the wonders of the Blockchain.\" Sometimes they even mention NameCoin or some of the new corporate Blockchains. But these articles always act like it is already a done deal. It's not.\nThey never mention that while this is technically possible, no one is actually using this yet.\nAs no one has solved the main problems or made it easy to use for everyone. Henry Ford did not invent the internal combustion engine, nor was he the first person to put one on a carriage to make it work without a horse. But he did put a car in every carriage house. And when he started most people had never even seen a car. He made cars practical and affordable. We plan to do this for distributed, difficult-to-censor DNS. NameCoin established some amazing concepts. BipCoin will take these ideas and make them easy to adopt for everyone.\nCointelegraph: Cryptocurrency enthusiasts seem to be gravitating towards financial anonymity these days. Is censorship resistance a blind spot?\nMichael W. Dean: Yes. It's a huge blind spot. It's all fine and well to have dark sites, and they serve a purpose, though they're none of my business, but they are not for everyone or everything. A lot of the internet that is legal many politicians would love to take down. Hell, on the campaign trail, the next president of the United States promised to punish journalists who piss him off. And it would be possible to use Dot-Bip to make human-rememberable addresses for TOR and other hidden activist sites.\nHowever, what we are looking to do with Dot-Bip is help a lot of the web have backups. You would still have your .com address, but the Dot-Bip would be an alternative in case you are ever seized. Lots of sites are seized where the owner is known but never arrested. It\u2019s so easy to seize the sites, that government thugs consider that enough.\nEven if Dot-Bip became acceptable as a \"just in case\" thing that many sites have, if it were ever needed, it would be there, and people would have the means to access it. If they are there and people can access them and test them but they're never needed for any of that web user's favorite sites, they are still useful, as a thought experiment, like Cody Wilson's printable gun.", "birthday": "2016-12-23T14:00:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-23 14:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 23}

This should not come as a surprise as Indians form the world\u2019s largest diaspora, according to figures released by the United Nations. In the past five years, more than two mln have migrated abroad. In total about 15.6 mln people born in India now live abroad.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Indians working abroad sent a record $72 bln in remittances to India.

The table below illustrates the countries that sent the most remittances to India according to Pew Global:\n\nMore bang for your buck\nSending money abroad is an expensive business. In countries like India, where people are unfortunately one of its largest exports due to endemic unemployment, poverty and lack of opportunities, and price consciousness of money transfer rates is rather high.\nAt the moment most such international remittances flow through commercial banks, non-bank Money-Transfer Operators (MTOs), foreign exchange bureaus, post offices etc.\nHowever, using any of these channels is expensive.\nIn a press release by the Indian Bitcoin company Unocoin a partnership with Bitwage has been announced, a Blockchain powered platform which works on an international payroll.

Properly executed large-scale cyber attacks can simultaneously disrupt communication, ground military jets, or attack civil infrastructures such as hospitals, power plants and major cities\u2019 communication.\nAdeolu Fadele, President and Founder Cryptography Development Initiative of Nigeria (CDIN), says:\n \u201cIt is now generally believed that the next wars will be fought online, that is why nation-state attacks are now common. For a nation to become or retain world power status in the digital age of today, such nations have to possess exceptional sophistication in cyber defense and attack.\u201d \nPerimeter security is unreliable\nExisting cybersecurity systems have been vulnerable. In October 2016, A massive Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack took several high-profile websites such as Twitter, Amazon, the New York Times, offline. This attack didn\u2019t target any of these companies directly, but rather Dyn, the company that provides DNS services for each of those sites.\nFadele tells Cointelegraph that the inherent vulnerabilities in our present day systems are the major reason why perimeter defense has become a standard practice. Now that the traditional perimeter fences can no longer hold the fire posed by the Advance Persistent Threat (APT) type of attacks, the need for an attack resistant distributed ledger technology like Bitcoin Blockchain has become inevitable.\nBetter chances to survive\nAccording to Grant Blaisdell of Coinfirm Blockchain Lab, Blockchain technologies could greatly decrease potential damage due to the simple fact that attackers would have to attack an entire mesh of systems instead of a central point. Moreover, there is a big chance that even if attacked the majority of infrastructure will be unaffected.\n\u201cWhen it comes to IT \"perimeter security\" is not the best strategy as it leaves targets vulnerable and isolated during cyber attacks. A distributed network with Blockchain-based decisions within it provide better communication and ability to counteract threats,\u201d says Blaisdell.\nGovernments afraid of losing control\nConsidering why governments may be reluctant towards embracing the disruptive technology, Blaisdell says that such could be due to the irrational fear of losing control. For decades (or even centuries) all governments and public administrations centralize decision-making and crucial infrastructures but such a strategy is being proven inefficient and insecure with thousands of incidents like email leaks or data thefts. A Blockchain-based unified system for administration, security and even the military would drastically decrease the risk of attack and potential damage.", "birthday": "2016-12-26T14:40:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-26 14:40:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 26}

The downward movement can turn out to be the last subwave of the downward correction.\nETH/USD\nThe correction towards the downward movement which has started at $8.8 has not been fully formed. The upward movement has failed to break through the diagonal channel, thus not reaching a key level, which was a profitable area for the majority of the bears. Thus, this downward movement is mostly a rebound, rather than a turn to decline. That was manifested in the form of a flat-like fall.\nJudging by the buy stop orders, the current situation with the price of Ether is the most profitable for the majority of the bulls. Ether is currently being traded at a key long-term level, which can be the peak of a long-term correction towards the upward trend. That is why, we can see large volumes of buy orders from $7 to $5, which in turn impacts the movement of ETH\u2019s price. This situation is unprofitable for big buyers in terms of short-term speculation. That means that Ether has little chance to fall sharply.\nFor as long as the downward structure remains intact, the downward correction will continue. The levels of the most likely upward rebound of Ether\u2019s price are situated near $7, $6.5 and $6, with the $6 mark being the most important one. As a rule of thumb, the majority of buy orders are usually situated near the peaks. That is what the large short-term speculators take advantage of when they sell Ether to the buyers at the peak when they expect further upward movement, and then buy back much more Ether from the same people, when they start selling, expecting no further growth.", "birthday": "2016-12-27T12:25:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-27 12:25:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 27}

These changes include a better pricing model and the new smart contracts consulting feature.\nDraglet, in operation since 2013, provides a full-stack white-label software solution for anyone to set up their own cryptocurrency exchange, with a focus on security, flexibility and availability.\nWhite-label software: your own exchange, minus the technical hassle.\nDealing with the lack of IT professionals\nIT expertise is a requirement when building almost any kind of business in crypto, especially when talking about cryptocurrency exchanges, whose software has to operate 24/7, without significant malfunctions, all the while being a constant target of malicious attacks by hackers.\nHowever, given the explosive growth in the popularity of cryptocurrencies, especially over the past several years, it\u2019s hard to expect every new person involved in the industry to be an IT professional. Marketing and advertising specialists, designers, managers, and other kinds of professionals have much to offer for the industry but are often unable to do so, due to the high barrier to entry.\nDraglet, as well as several other white-label software providers, target their solutions at these kind of professionals. And due to the recent changes, Draglet might just be taking a lead over the competition.\nThe new pricing model\nThe new pricing model, as well as the existing modular features, makes for a highly flexible system, allowing anyone to choose exactly the setup they need, without having to worry about overpaying for anything.\nUp until recently, Draglet has been operating in a manner, which is pretty standard throughout the industry, where every contract purchase involves an upfront fee, as well as some sort of recurring operational costs, such as profit sharing or per-execution fee. The company has dealt away with the latter part, only leaving the yearly licensing cost, the amount of which depends on the precise services selected by the customer.\nThere are two major options available now: hosted and download. If a customer chooses the former, the team of Draglet arranges the entire setup of the exchange, from renting servers, to installing the software, as well as maintaining its operation.\nAlternatively, they can choose the download option, and take care of the hardware and installation themselves, retaining definitive ownership of their customer and trading data. In both cases, the customer has to buy a yearly exchange license.\nA number of additional services are also available in the form of add-ons, which includes increased liquidity, additional languages and coins for the exchange, a distributed shared order book, and so on. The full list of features, with their corresponding prices, can be found here.\nDeveloping Blockchain applications\nWith their several years of experience in developing Blockchain-based software, the team of Draglet will be able to conduct a feasibility study and implementation estimation of many potential business cases involving Ethereum Smart Contracts, digital tokens, private Blockchains, both for business clients, and individuals.\nOnline exchanges are not the only thing which is booming in the Blockchain industry. In fact, Blockchain applications outside cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly more widespread. Blockchain\u2019s resilience, immutability and efficiency can be advantageous in many business cases, and there are already tools out there which allow for Blockchain integration with relative ease, such as Ethereum, Lisk or Ardor.\nHowever, even exploring the feasibility of this integration still requires a great deal of technical expertise, and that is why Draglet has decided to offer a new service - Blockchain Consulting.

In his analysis, Lingham predicted that the Bitcoin price will double or triple within the next 12 months.\nOver the past year, Lingham has been one of the few analysts who accurately predicted the price trend of Bitcoin. In a blog post published in April, Lingham told his readers that Bitcoin would reach a market cap of $15 bln by the end of the year. Today, it surpassed the $15 bln mark, reaching its all-time high market cap.\nThe reasons behind strong performance\nThe vast majority of mainstream media outlets and analysts have cited economic and financial factors as a reason for Bitcoin\u2019s price rally. Various events such as the demonetization of banknotes in India and Venezuela, crackdown on Wealth Management Products (WPMs) and tightening of capital controls played a strong role in the rising price of Bitcoin. However, Lingham notes that most failed to acknowledge the impact of rising Federal Reserve rates on the value of Bitcoin.\nWhen the Federal Reserve increases interest rates, the value of the United States dollars naturally rises. The increasing value of the dollar then leads to the devaluation of other major currencies like the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen, which ultimately strengthens the value of Bitcoin amid rising demand.\nThus, when the Federal Reserve raised its rates for the second time on December 14, Bitcoin saw a large spike in demand and price, pushing it to multi-month highs and all-time high market cap.\nLingham wrote:", "birthday": "2016-12-28T11:35:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-28 11:35:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 28}

As every website needs to generate some money for its maintenance and for creating high-quality content, they must also publish their ads vigorously. It\u2019s OK when the ads are beautifully and creatively done so as that they entertain rather than annoy you. It is a different story when you see banners popping up on the Web page suggesting you to lose weight, get acquainted with Asian girls, or upgrade some of your body parts.\nI guess my friend expresses an opinion of the majority by saying:\n \u201cIf I want to buy something online, I will search for it. An annoying banner popping up will not make me buy something if I don\u2019t plan it.\u201d \nHow do we keep everyone happy to ensure that publishers get their money and users are not bothered by tiresome ads? One may say that it is not possible. However, the guys from ADZbuzz proudly present their solution.\n$22 billions dollar question\nEvery year, publishers lose billions\u00a0of dollars because we get annoyed by advertisements and we dare to install an ad blocking software. For instance, in the year 2015 alone, ad blockers have caused a loss of $22 billion\u00a0dollars for Web publishers. This number keeps on rising, as ad blocking is going mainstream all over the world.\nADZbuzz developers say:\n \u201cIt becomes clear that the ad-supported Web that allows advertisers to promote their products or services on publisher sites is something way too old-fashioned and not working effectively. Visitors suffer from banner blindness making non-intrusive ads worthless, so the only solution is found in distracting people in such a way that a normal browsing experience becomes impossible. This is why ad blockers exist and why people block ads.\u201d \nThree ways to fool the site visitor\nSo far, there have been three main strategies used by publishers in this fight for the right to be seen.\nFirst of all, there are numerous scripts available to block ad blockers, which are not that efficient. As soon as a script is detected, the community blacklists the provider, who chooses to create a new script to let ads pass through. This is clearly a temporary solution that costs a lot for a publisher as it destroys the publisher\u2019s brand completely. Besides, it\u2019s not a surprise that multiple solutions to deal with anti-ad blocks have been developed.\nSome websites have been blocking visitors who have an ad blocker installed. Therefore, they were not able to access certain content or features of the website unless they turned off the ad block. That\u2019s not a very effective solution either, as obviously only a small share of visitors would turn it off, while others would simply go to a different website.\nThere is also another strategy which is more aggressive - to make premium content paid and make money this way. This doesn\u2019t require advertising as a revenue stream as the paywalls are the main source of income for the publishers. It could be considered as a rational solution, however, we are so used to being able to access online content for free that it doesn\u2019t become an easy sale for websites, especially for those with a huge amount of daily readers.\nADZbuzz suggests a process that allows Internet users to block ads while also allowing them to access high-quality content for free.\nRevisiting Web advertising\nFighting ad blocking is not a viable solution. Blocking visitors who make a conscious decision to block annoying ads can\u2019t be considered as a good business strategy.\nADZbuzz Ublock strives to create a win-win situation for all by clearing Web space from the annoying ads while paying publishers directly from the revenue generated by a centralized advertising platform.\nADZbuzz suggests creating an ad blocker along with a script that publishers can install on their site to be able to identify if visitors have an ad blocker installed. The script tracks the amount of visitors and calculates the amount of revenue for a publisher.", "birthday": "2016-12-22T14:10:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-22 14:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 22}

We covered a while ago the possibility of social payments and how social networking combined with payment services could usher in a new era. There are already disruptors like Stripe on the scene which are helping people with payments.\nNow if we think about it, if money transfer, lending, payment gateways and basic banking is already being taken care of by tech companies, what future does the banking industry have?\nBanks know that they have the very real possibility of dying out and they are even in fear of their employees. The New York Times cites a Citigroup report as saying: \u201cSome 800,000 people will have lost their jobs at financial services companies to some of the newly dreamed up software in a decade. Roughly 60 to 70 percent of retail banking employees are doing manual-processing-driven jobs, if all the current manual processing can be replaced by automation, these jobs can disappear or evolve.\u201d", "birthday": "2016-12-22T16:35:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-22 16:35:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 22}

Ibn Battuta, the Moroccan scholar spent some time at this Sultan\u2019s court and wrote of him as a man who seldom took advice and depended solely on his own judgment.\nModi and Tughlak\nTughlak is famous in Indian history for shifting the capital from Delhi to the South Indian city of Daulatabad. It is said that he forced the whole population of Delhi to shift as well. As Ziauddin Barani wrote about him, \u201cWithout consultation or weighing the pros and cons, he brought run on Delhi which for 170 to 180 years had grown in prosperity and rivaled Baghdad and Cairo. The city with its Sarais (Inns) and suburbs and villages spread over four or five leagues, all was destroyed and deserted. Not a cat or a dog was left.\"\nThe story of the Sultan is important because the present Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India is a similarly inclined man who has been criticized for not seeking the counsel of those who may know better. In fact, the Prime Minister has been directly compared to the Sultan by many opposition politicians like Manish Tiwari, the spokesman of the main Congress Party and Sitaram Yechury of the Communist Party. Is the demonetization of the 86 percent of the currency going to bring rack and ruin upon India? Quite possibly, yes if recent events and instability are any indication.\nMany ruffled feathers\nPossibly the greatest criticism that has been leveled against the Modi government has been that there was no planning centered around demonetization. After over 40 days have passed, there is still considerable chaos in India. If we go by the word of the Indian government, this was a surprise move that was initiated in such a way so as to tackle black money hoarders. As we have already discounted that possibility in our previous coverage.\nHowever, the bungled up efforts of this government have not escaped the notice of publications like the Economist either, \u201cA broad cash crunch and broken supply chains threaten a sharp economic slowdown \u2014 albeit one that will abate, at least in part, as the cash squeeze is alleviated. India\u2019s \u201cdemonetisation\u201d is a cautionary tale of the reckless misuse of one of the most potent of policy tools: control over an economy\u2019s money.\u201d\nIncidentally, this coverage of the Economist seems to have miffed the Reserve Bank of India, which did not allow the Economist\u2019s correspondent to cover the interest rate event that it held later on. Stanley Pignal of the Economist tweeted:\u00a0\u201cAmazing stuff: @theeconomist us no longer invited to RBI policy meeting press conferences. Won't let me in. Sad day for transparency.\u201d\nThen there is the issue of the new notes and their denominations. India has a Right to Information Act (RTI), under which citizens can demand reasonable information from government institutions. An RTI application filed by activist Anil Galgali indicates that the government had not even printed Rs. 500 notes on the day the Prime Minister announced demonetization. The supply of Rs. 2000 notes also seem to have been a mere 4.94 trillion according to India\u2019s News18 network, which is a pittance compared with the Rs. 20.5 trillion of currency the central bank demonetized. Basically either the Prime Minister jumped the gun and announced the demonetization ahead of time or there was simply no planning to this madness.\nChanging goal posts\nThe latest rule that the RBI has made with regards to demonetization is that it has withdrawn the Rs. 5000 deposit limit imposed on bank accounts for people wishing to deposit old currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 denominations.\nThis rule goes into effect from December 21, 2016, and the restriction was only put in place on December 19, 2016. In the notification issued on December 19, 2016, the bank had stated, \u201cTenders of SBNs in excess of \u20b9 5000 into a bank account will be received for credit only once during the remaining period till December 30, 2016. The credit in such cases shall be afforded only after questioning tenderer, on record, in the presence of at least two officials of the bank, as to why this could not be deposited earlier and receiving a satisfactory explanation. The explanation should be kept on record to facilitate an audit trail at a later stage. An appropriate flag also should be raised in CBS to that effect so that no more tenders are allowed.\u201d\nIf we were to translate from the archaic and complex language used by the Reserve Bank it basically meant that if you wanted to put in more than Rs. 5000 in your own bank account, you could do so only once and with two bank officials standing witness and you providing a written explanation!

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/five-things-every-investor-should-know-about-bitcoin", "title": " Five Things Every Investor Should Know about Bitcoin ", "content": "Amid global economic instability and financial crisis, investors are becoming increasingly aware of Bitcoin and its advantages over traditional forms of assets and money. Although many investors remain wary of Bitcoin\u2019s fluctuating price, there are five major aspects of Bitcoin which every investor must know about.\n1. High Liquidity\nBitcoin has significantly high liquidity in regions and countries with well-established Bitcoin infrastructure and regulations. Countries like South Korea, Taiwan and Switzerland offer higher liquidity than most assets and, sometimes, even credit cards due to the presence of startups that enable accessible locations such as convenience stores to facilitate fiat-to-Bitcoin trading.\nFor high profile traders, many exchanges enable trades of up to $100,000 per day and daily trading limits of exchanges in highly regulated countries like the US and South Korea are much higher. While investors have to deal with extensive KYC policies and regulations, traditional assets and bank systems demand even more complex KYC/AML requirements.\n2. Lowering Volatility\nMerchants and investors often express their concerns towards Bitcoin\u2019s high volatility. However, over the past year, the volatility rate of Bitcoin has substantially decreased, becoming less volatile than some reserve currencies, including the pound sterling.\nThe decreasing volatility rate of Bitcoin makes it more viable as a global currency, store of value and investment. More importantly, the price of Bitcoin has maintained an upward trend for almost six months as an increasing number of individuals and businesses begin to recognize Bitcoin as a protection against economic instability.\nFor instance, Bitcoin trading and demand in countries like India and China have surged over the past three months because of heavy capital controls and financial regulations imposed by local authorities.\n3. Transportability\nBitcoin is the only asset, currency and store of value in the world today which investors can settle cross-border payments with ease. Other forms of currencies or assets such as gold, which was long considered to be the global safe haven asset, make inefficient stores of value as they require the presence of a third-party service provider or certain infrastructure to transport.\nMore importantly, some countries currently have strict regulations and restrictions on the trading and transportation of physical assets like gold. Thus, governments and authorities can easily seize or confiscate assets like gold whereas Bitcoin cannot be controlled by a centralized entity.\nAlso, the fees for Bitcoin transactions are independent and are not based on a number of transactions. That means, whichever amount an investor hopes to send to a recipient can be settled with the average fee of $0.11. This fee applies to any transaction of any size, regardless of the amount of money being dealt with.\n\n- source:\u00a0bitcoinfees.21.co", "birthday": "2016-12-18T13:49:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-18 13:49:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 18}

However, there are six major events that could lead to a surge in the price of Bitcoin in 2017. These include the activation of Segregated Witness, hereinafter Segwit, the \u00a0release of Lightning Network and Tumblebit, approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the financial crash and economic instability.\nSegwit, Lightning, Tumblebit\nSegwit, Lightning and Tumblebit are all scalability solutions initially introduced to facilitate larger amounts of transactions primarily to deal with the increasing user base and transaction volume of Bitcoin.\nBy far, Segwit has the highest probability of being activated due to the support from wallet platforms, startups and miners. Bitnodes, a platform build by 21 Inc., states that 39.3% of all nodes are in support of Segwit. Once Segwit reaches its activation threshold, which would require the consensus of 95% of miners, it will increase the capacity of the Bitcoin network by at least 2.1x, according to the latest research from Alex Petrov of Bitfury.\nA study of Whale Panda, which featured Petrov\u2019s research read, \u201cThe actual size of a block under Segwit depends on the kind of transactions being included, however, the figure of 1.7MB was based on the average transaction profile in January 2015. At the time of writing in November of 2016, it would be around 2.1MB.\u201d\nLightning and Tumblebit will also scale the Bitcoin network but in methods dissimilar to Segwit. Instead of increasing the capacity of Bitcoin blocks, Lightning enables the settlement of instantaneous micropayments that are currently not possible to execute due to the settlement times of transactions.\nOn top of enhanced scalability, Tumblebit will provide anonymity to Bitcoin users, offering financial freedom and privacy.\nThe activation of these three major scalability and privacy solutions will play a vital role in increasing the value of Bitcoin as the network becomes more efficient and anonymous.", "birthday": "2016-12-18T12:41:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-18 12:41:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 18}
{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-human-impact-of-bitcoins-scaling-problems", "title": " The Human Impact of Bitcoin's Scaling Problems ", "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s one-megabyte block size limit, and the scaling issues that come with it, have long caused a deep divide within the community. Some in the community have supported an unchanged block size while waiting for a release of Segregated Witness, while others have attempted to fork Bitcoin to increase the block size. In the meantime, transactions have become increasingly slow and expensive as the network becomes increasingly overloaded. Unfortunately, there is a human cost to these delays.\nBitcoin\u2019s confirmation times keep climbing\nAs its user base has grown, Bitcoin\u2019s transaction volume has exceeded current network capacity, causing a delay in transactions. The current one-megabyte limit of blocks frequently shows blocks at capacity, and the mempool of backlogged transactions continues to grow, peaking at over 48 million unconfirmed transactions during a spam attack in November. The median confirmation time continues to rise and currently rests at about 15 minutes per transaction. However, in March when confirmation times were shorter, Reddit user /u/seweso compiled the average rather than mean transaction time and came up with a much higher figure of 43 minutes.\nBill McGonigle from New Hampshire, the owner of Bitcoin-accepting business Kidsweet, LLC, has run into delays in online shopping:\n \u201cNothing so dramatic, but using it online I've had to keep an eye on transactions for more than an hour to take the next step in checkout or whatever. Check it, nope, get distracted, come back later, check it, nope, go do something else, check it - ah, finally I can finish checkout (hope the card hasn't expired). Not a huge pain, but if I want to buy with BTC I have to plan to be at the same computer for the next two hours. Compared with PayPal, where I can buy something five minutes before I'm out the door.\u201d \nThough the annoyance of having to wait around before a transaction confirms is real, McGonigle sees a greater threat in crippling Bitcoin\u2019s basic utility:\n \u201cIf somebody is trying to make Bitcoin practically unusable, they're doing a great job.\u201d \nThe delay in transactions is especially apparent to users of other cryptocurrencies that have not faced similar scaling challenges. Roel Boer, co-founder of Nocks from the Netherlands, noticed the slow speed of Bitcoin when it was exchanged for Gulden through his service:\n \u201cWe had someone that purchased 6 BTC worth of Gulden through us with Nocks. He initiated the purchase on Saturday and the Bitcoin confirms came in late Monday.\u201d \nFees are rising and becoming less competitive against card processors\nAs blocks become overloaded, Bitcoin\u2019s transaction fees must increase in order for priority transfers to go through on time. As such, fees have been rising over the past several years, cutting into one of the main competitive advantages over traditional financial transactions. According to data compiled by Bitcoinfees.21.co, the average fee for a transaction to be included within the next six blocks, possibly over an hour\u2019s time, is about $0.14, with the average for the next 3 blocks and next block approximating $0.16.\nFor reference, the point of sale system Square charges 2.75% for swiped card transactions. For a $3 cup of coffee, that would amount to $0.075. A Bitcoin transaction would cost double and take possibly an hour or more to confirm, compared to a card processor\u2019s instant transaction. For larger transactions Bitcoin still remains more efficient than traditional wealth transfer methods, but for everyday use it has begun to lose the game.\nFor Chloe Sowers from New Hampshire, the fees required for an efficient transaction ended up being noticeable:\n \u201cI had to pay such a high fee for my meal that Bitcoin fees are like a 1.8% sales tax.\u201d \nBitcoin\u2019s network issues are seriously impacting everyday usability\nBeyond a simple annoyance, the significant delays in confirmation times can have serious implications for day-to-day business. Most major companies and services require at least one confirmation before processing orders in order to protect against double spends and transactions with an insufficient fee to ever be confirmed. This can result in a transaction taking hours, even days, to complete, making many transactions untenable.\nMalcolm MacLeod from South Africa had a slow Bitcoin transaction cost him savings:", "birthday": "2016-12-19T12:45:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-19 12:45:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 19}

Its adoption as everyday money, however, remains negligent among the common people, almost eight years after the digital currency first emerged.\nWhile the title of \u201c the first cryptocurrency\u201d is no longer up for grabs, the title of \u201cdigital cash\u201d still remains unclaimed, ready to be seized by another up-and-coming digital money. In order to become the common medium of exchange for large swaths of the world, a cryptocurrency first needs to fulfill a few crucial requirements.\nEasy and inexpensive transactions\nForget about cryptocurrency for a second. Right now, regular people use either cash or card for day-to-day transactions.\nCash has no transaction costs but requires you to be physically present and have adequate change, and card transactions are relatively instant, though final confirmations often happen the next day, although fees are relatively high it is enough to disincentivize very small transactions. Any cryptocurrency wanting to make inroads with the common people has to beat this by having faster and cheaper transactions.\nBitcoin\u00a0already offers this advantage, though the margin by which it does is growing slimmer by the day, and even now it may not be enough to entice the public to abandon traditional financial means. Any cash or card replacement has to be better by a large enough margin to warrant a change.\nThe same goes for fees. Cash has no fees. Other money transfer tools, like cards and bank accounts, are able to charge a fee because they are able to function across great distances with greater efficiency. Cryptocurrency has those same advantages over cash, and as such can be expected to have an associated transaction fee. However, that fee must be significantly lower in order to entice your average consumer away from banking systems. Large companies can afford to make major payment changes in order to save a few cents per transaction because of scale, but regular people cannot.\nImprovements to Bitcoin\u2019s basic model\nBitcoin retains an enormous lead in adoption ahead of other cryptocurrencies. Compared to traditional financial systems, Bitcoin provides enough benefits and improvements to warrant a switch. If a currency wants to beat Bitcoin as the new money, it has to be objectively better.

We\u2019re incentivizing their participation by rewarding them with tokens for performing various activities, such as completing registration, inviting a friend, etc. \u00a0Gather enough tokens and you can exchange them with a virtual cashier for real local currency. With this currency, they can begin making purchases and generating real economic activity. \nWhen we look at the humanitarian applications, we also find that there\u2019s a high demand for being able to circumvent local bureaucracies and high overhead charities so that donations can go directly to responsible local parties who are in need. Towards this goal, we\u2019re working with several former politicians and U.N. agency employees who have a great deal of experience dealing with the logistical frustrations of trying to deliver international assistance.\nWe\u2019re confident that we can help connect donors and NGOs to the people who need help without losing 80 percent along the way, which is fairly common financial leakage when so many charities spend enormous sums on marketing and overhead. \u00a0 \u00a0\nLaunching a pilot\nCT: With more than two bln people without bank accounts globally, don't you think yours is an insurmountable task?\n When you face a task like this, you can\u2019t look at the peak of the mountain, you have to look at the whole mountain and envision your path up it. Then you break your goals down further and plan out how you\u2019re going to negotiate each section of the climb. \u00a0 \nAF:\u00a0What our milestones are, what kind of support is required, how much time will we need for each section, etc. When you do this, climbing any mountain is possible. We understand the steps we need to take, and it starts with convincing investors that our plan is achievable and our product is viable. Once we get funding, we move beyond the prototype and dive into developing the interface and backend for our service. \u00a0\nWe\u2019ve got a partner lined up in South Africa who will help us launch a pilot program there so we can do a proof of concept test once we get to that stage. We know it\u2019s not just about having a great dev team, we are also building out a network of local advocates, because the best way to get someone to use a new service is to show them how useful it is. \u00a0", "birthday": "2016-12-16T14:05:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-16 14:05:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 16}

Four of the five trends revealed by King involved Blockchain technology, with Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain payments, tokenization and encryption included as major trends for next year.\nTokenization, Encryption, Blockchain Payments, IoT\nAccording to King, five major trends will dominate the payment industry in 2017. The five trends are IoT, Blockchain, tokenization, encryption and mobile payments, all of which seems to involve Blockchain technology both directly and indirectly.\nEncryption, Blockchain payments and IoT are three of the most obvious payment applications that will most likely heavily depend on Bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology. Currently, there is a small range of applications or technologies that ensure strong encryption of financial data. Also, most IoT networks are beginning to be powered by Blockchain platforms due to their transparency, unprecedented security measures and real-time data settlement.\nKing particularly pointed out that large-scale financial networks that hold private information and important financial data of users are like \u201choneypots\u201d for criminals, as they can use the identities and credit information for various criminal uses.\nTo avoid any instances of data theft, King notes that point-to-point encryption (P2PE) must be adopted by credit card and bank service providers.\nKing stated:\n \u201cAs cybercriminals continue to target the ecosystem, more and more merchants are investing in point-to-point encryption (P2PE) to maintain the integrity of payment transactions and secure the card data.\u201d ", "birthday": "2016-12-16T17:25:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-16 17:25:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 16}

The official FX value of the Venezuelan bolivar is $1 to 9.95 VEF but in actuality, in the country\u2019s black market, local residents are paying around 5,000 VEF for $1. To avoid the devaluation of bolivar and acquire necessary daily goods, Venezuelans have started to rely on Bitcoin to finance their expenditures.\nBy local exchange rates, 100 bolivar is equivalent to $0.02. The country\u2019s highest denomination banknote was 100 bolivar, but the government demonetized it earlier this week. As a result, the Venezuelan economy and monetary system experienced turmoil as people struggled to obtain cash to finance daily living.\nCurrently, the largest denomination banknote is the 50 bolivar note, which is worth $0.01. So, for Venezuelans to purchase a slice of bread or lunch, they will need 200 of the 50 bolivar banknotes to purchase lunch at around $4.\nNathan Crooks, Bloomberg News chief in Venezuela, revealed that people carry stacks of cash in order to purchase basic goods like food, toiletries, etc.\nWhy people are switching to Bitcoin", "birthday": "2016-12-17T11:05:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-17 11:05:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 17}

His key objectives in scraping 86 percent of the circulating currency in a country of over 1 bln people, was to remove \u201cblack money\u201d out of the system, fight counterfeiters and stop the financing of terrorist organizations. While it can be argued that the measure may have had limited success in all of these fields, the demonetization policy has broadly failed.\nBlack money is well and alive\nThe government in carrying out the demonetization had hoped that a large percentage of the circulating cash would simply not make it back into the banking system. It was hoped that the holders of black money would prefer to have it invalidated rather than bring their sacks of ill-gotten wealth to banks and face penalties of up to 200 percent tax, which had been previously announced by the authorities.\nHowever, according to the Economic Times, the government is in for a shock:\n \u201cThe RBI had said that Rs 8.45 lakh crore was deposited and exchanged during 10-27 November, after the implementation of the note ban from 9 November. Between 28 and 30 November, the State Bank of India saw deposits increasing by Rs 22,000 crore. In a recent submission to the Supreme Court, the Attorney General had said that the government expected Rs 10 lakh crore back as deposits. This raises questions whether the exercise was worth carrying out at all.\u201d \nFor readers unfamiliar with the Indian system of counting; 1 crore = 10 mln and 1 Lakh = one hundred thousand.\nThe nitty-gritty is that not only have people managed to convert their untaxed income at the banks through so-called Jan Dhan accounts, they have also been able to buy assets like gold. Jan Dhan accounts were opened by the government with relaxed KYC and AMC norms for the purpose of financial inclusiveness.\nAnother route that many people with untaxed income have taken is to fly the cash out to India\u2019s remote northeast region, where many tribes are exempt from Indian income tax. Some people have also taken to transferring the money to farmers who are also tax exempt.\nBloomberg ran a story quoting an Indian lawyer on how this exchange is being carried out: \u201cIndividuals are transporting millions of rupees on trains or vehicles, and the big money-laundering networks have been chartering flights to transport crateloads of cash to India\u2019s northeast from small airfields.\u201d\nCounterfeiters shift home\nPerhaps the most shocking effect of the demonetization has been the shift of currency counterfeiting from offshore locations to the homeland. In the past, the Indian government has largely blamed the neighboring country of Pakistan of smuggling in fake Indian currency.\nNow that new banknotes have been introduced by the government, Indian citizens have taken the initiative of printing fake money at home. In a shocking case that came to light during the past month, a young engineering graduate and a beneficiary of Mr. Modi\u2019s \u2018Make in India\u2019 program used his skills to print fake Rs. 2000 notes worth Rs. 4.2 mln. Abhinav Verma and his accomplices were not only printing fake Indian currency but also running a racket exchanging old notes for new in the north Indian city of Mohali, Punjab.\nThe police in other parts of India have also seized counterfeit notes of the new Rs. 2000 denomination including in Hyderabad in South India, where according to the Hindustan Times:\n \u201cOf the Rs 2,22,310 fake currency seized from the gang, Rs 2000 notes were worth Rs 2,10,000. The remaining fake currency was in small denominations of Rs 100, Rs 50, Rs 20 and Rs 10. The police also seized two colour Xerox machines and Rs 50,000 in cash among other incriminating material.\u201d \nIt would appear that non-familiarity with the new currency is opening up avenues for many domestic counterfeiters to dabble in the currency exchange business. The chaos and the panic created by the situation have also led to the proliferation of this business. It is highly unlikely that people who have untaxed wealth are likely to complain to the police if they are stuck with counterfeit notes by certain unscrupulous people and criminal elements.\nTerrorists and corrupt politicians get hold of new cash\nIf Mr. Modi\u2019s move was aimed at terrorism, then it can be argued that it has had limited success. Central India has been recently hit by the Naxals, a left-wing terror group. The government claims that demonetization has impacted their resources and there appears to be some truth to these claims.", "birthday": "2016-12-09T17:10:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-09 17:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 9}

We have seen different creations by a lot of companies emerge, all presenting their functional real case uses for the disruptive technology.\nGovernments and banks have also not been left behind in the developmental processes of the Blockchain, as we have seen a number of tests and implementation of the Blockchain at these levels.\nReviewing the year ending 2016, principal consultant at Bankcoin Reserve Pty Ltd, Thomas McAlister, says that we have seen great exposure for Blockchain technology. According to McAlister, this exposure was mainly motivated by the race for market capture, as many companies made efforts to showcase their product within this emerging industry in order to achieve meaningful followership as early as possible.\nProof of Stake role to increase\nMcAlister thinks that 2017 will be a year of patent litigation and heavy negotiations as the dust begins to settle and pieces of the puzzle start becoming adjusted. McAlister believes this necessary for the industry to assume a proper formation.\nHe says:\n \u201cWe have seen Proof of Work (POW) run its course and expose its limitations. I believe Proof of Stake (POS) will play a major dominant role in the market moving forward, in particular loans and deposits, superannuation and value asset exchange, which will essentially mean that a more stable and flexible financial instrument will become more visible. I am excited for what's to come in 2017.\u201d \nPresident at Crypto Consultant, Jason Cassidy, believes that 2016 will be remembered as the year that Blockchain technology's impact was felt beyond the realm of financial services.\nAccording to Cassidy, healthcare, identification, real estate, voting, gaming, tourism and even gold all made news on a global scale, powered by Blockchain technology.\nCassidy also identifies some of the trends or events in the Blockchain space from this year that have helped define the landscape going into 2017.\nGovernments talk Blockchain\nWith the increased awareness of the technology and pressure to provide a legal framework, governments have begun taking a closer look at what a Blockchain is and what it can do for them. This acknowledgment, according to Cassidy, is an important development in the on-going story of global Bitcoin and Blockchain adoption.\nICO-mania\nCassidy observes the perceived overwhelming trend of ICO's that poured into the Blockchain ecosystem, describing the phenomenon as hitting a new level of hype and awareness in 2016. So much so that many regulators across the world are now taking a closer look at this new investment mechanism.\nHe says:\n \u201cEvery day we have a new Blockchain offering in the form of an ICO. It is now at the point where it is becoming a sub-industry of its own.\u201d \u00a0 \nSmart, but not brilliant contracts\u00a0\nCassidy made reference to the DAO incidence which occurred around the middle of the year. He says that for many in the industry, the incidence was a watershed moment which brought about a controversy and ultimate decision that some feel goes against the very ethos of decentralization. He notes that few events had a more polarizing effect in the Blockchain industry, even making it into mainstream news. \u00a0\nMainstream awareness\u00a0\nThe increase in Blockchain awareness is also a development which Cassidy sees as significant:\n \u201cWhether it is local meetups, facebook groups, educational courses or major conferences, Blockchain\u2019s profile grew leaps and bounds over the past twelve months. Groups like Hyperledger are also helping growth in this vein by promoting collaboration across many levels.\u201d \nHe also notes that major corporations are joining the fray by creating brand new Blockchain products and services and helping to ensure they are not disrupted by a competitor as industries of scale entered the Blockchain race en masse in 2016. \u201cThis is can only mean good things as the threshold of innovation is set to be challenged once again.\u201d\u00a0\nMore of the same?\nAs far as what the community can expect from the Blockchain space in 2017, Cassidy predicts a continuation of mainly the same processes.\nCassidy says that as adoption grows, many of these trends will continue to play out and inevitably give way to new ones.", "birthday": "2016-12-10T15:00:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-10 15:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 10}

While we think a breakout is coming in the not too distant future, the road to $800 may be slower and more turbulent than most traders expect.\nAs we get closer to the holidays for many traders around the globe, there are a few fundamental factors that are aiding the technicals in driving prices incrementally higher. First of all, the general time period that we are currently in, which is mid-December through early January, is typically very bullish for Bitcoin from a seasonal perspective. Additionally, failing governments around the world continue to do Bitcoin favors by remaining steadfast in their plans to ban cash or at least large denominations, and this time it\u2019s Venezuela\u2019s turn. Finally, gold is still under selling pressure as the bear market stretches on while Bitcoin continues its steady rise to new highs, a signal to the market that perhaps things are changing. \u00a0Regardless, these are just contributing factors to what is and has been a largely bullish technical story for the past year.\nSpeaking of the longer-term outlook, we quickly wanted to take a look at a stripped down weekly chart in order to get a better idea of where we currently are in the cycle. No doubt that the frying pan bottom continues to develop as expected, especially considering there is also possible inverse head and shoulders and cup and handle formations that are in play, both of which imply much more upside from the current levels. Also, notice that the market structure is outright bullish, total exchange volumes are certainly confirming the uptrend, and the A/D line continues to head higher, signaling continued buying even at these elevated levels.

The bulls are at the bottom limit of the flat, so the growth of Ether\u2019s price can continue up to $13 - 14.\nETH/USD\nAs we have predicted a week earlier, there was a rebound from the bottom limit of the long-term sideway movement, and Ether\u2019s price has stopped at a key medium-term level of $8.3. The price has previously dropped right before this. At that moment big sellers have taken advantage of the situation and sold a large volume close to $7. After that, they started buying it back at $6. The fact that there was a reaction at the bottom limit is indicative of the existence of support for the upward trend. However, for more confident growth, ETH has to break through the level of $8.3.\n\nA stop near $8.3 is a decisive point for the long-term trend.\nDue to the peak of the downward movement which is situated currently near $6 turnout may be limited to the long-term downward correction, which started this summer, the long-term trend can keep rising to at least $20. If someone were to buy now that would result in a profit of 230%. There needs to be an observation of confirmations at key points. First, we need a turning wave at the current level of $8.3. The upward turn structure can provoke the long-term wave of the flat into growing up to $13 - 14. A key long-term resistance is demonstrated at that level. As we can see, a large volume of Ether\u2019s sell orders is concentrated above the diagonal channel. Accordingly, a new rebound can take place near $13, and the price will start forming a new wave of the flat. In a conservative scenario, the price has to confirm the growth towards $20 by fortifying and forming a turn near $13. However, this scenario may not be realized if a big buyer appears on the market. In this case, the price of Ether will break through a key level at $13 - 14 and continue growing without any significant rebounds.\nIf the price fortifies at $8.3 and forms a downward turn at the level of $6, the declining trend may continue until $3.5. For this to occur there needs to be an upward rebound not higher than \u00a0$11. The inability of the price to grow beyond $11 will disrupt the structure of the long-term flat, which will indicate that the bears are holding the advantage. After that, there needs to be a confirmation in the form of a downward turning wave, which has to fortify at $6. Under such conditions, the downward trend will stand a better chance to continue.\nAt the moment, considering the current distribution of sell orders, the downward movement will most probably be flat-like.", "birthday": "2016-12-13T13:53:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-13 13:53:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 13}

Bitcoin Games is an impressive gambling hub, with a focus on ease of use, security and profitability for the players.\nCointelegraph has reached out to Roger Ver, the founder and CEO of Bitcoin.com, which owns Bitcoin Games, to let him tell us more about the new platform.\nCointelegraph: Why did you decide to get into the cryptocurrency gambling business now when the market is so full of all kinds of great platforms?\nRoger Ver: Bitcoin.com is the perfect domain to become the premier source for anything and everything Bitcoin-related on the Internet. With all that Bitcoin offers to the gambling industry (speed of deposits, minimal KYC requirements, etc.) offering our own casino was a natural step to take. We recently partnered with BitcoinVideoCasino.com, but instead of simply integrating their offerings into Bitcoin.com we decided to build Bitcoin Games on their codebase and add our own flair and features to it.\nOne of our aims is to offer newcomers to Bitcoin, an immediate use-case where they can quickly see the benefits that Bitcoin offers them in terms of transaction speeds and ease of use, but also offer some of the best odds in the industry to established Bitcoiners who enjoy gambling.\nCT: Why should gambling enthusiasts switch to your casino from their websites of choice?\nRV: Bitcoin Games offers some of the lowest house edges in the industry with all players expecting a return of at least 99% or higher. On top of this, unlike many of our competitors, we don't engage in any trickery to keep funds on-site when it comes to a player's winnings. Once the funds are in a player's account those funds are the player's to do with as they see fit, either play for more winnings, withdraw in part or withdraw in full. We are also introducing bonuses and unique promotions to players that sign up with their email address, and our support system ensures all player queries are dealt with in a prompt and friendly fashion.\nCT: Do you have any advantages when it comes to Bitcoin newbies? Is your casino easy to use for a first-time player?\nRV: Given that Bitcoin.com is a one-stop-shop for everything relating to Bitcoin - information, wallets, getting started, etc. - and we offer a service whereby users can\u00a0purchase bitcoins with their credit card, Bitcoin Games is perfect for Bitcoin newbies who want to have a little fun with their funds. Our casino couldn't be easier for first-time players to use. No registration or sign-up is required as accounts are automatically created upon visiting Bitcoin Games; all a player has to do is scan their account's deposit QR code or paste their deposit address into their Bitcoin wallet and they can play immediately!\nCT: What about government interference? Do you have any precautions in place for possible crackdowns?\nRV: Bitcoin Games must be mindful of government interference, and unfortunately citizens and residents of the US, Iran, N. Korea, Syria, or any other country in which our services would be illegal are not allowed to play for real bitcoins on our site. This is an unfortunate consequence of politicians and lawmakers taking it upon themselves to tell their citizens what they can and cannot do with their own funds. Hopefully, we'll see a time in the near future where these ridiculous laws are repealed and people will be able to spend their own money however they please.\nIn terms of precautions for possible crackdowns, Bitcoin Games operates purely outside of the fiat currency realm and as such we have no immediate concerns to government crackdowns. This is, however, something we keep a very close eye on and our policies will evolve as necessary. We will continue at all times to protect our players\u2019 bitcoins and their right to play in our casino with their own funds.\nCT: You seem to have big plans for the future development of your platform. Is there anything in particular that the players should look forward to?\nRV: We do indeed have big plans for future development, not just on Bitcoin Games but for the whole Bitcoin.com platform. Where Bitcoin Games is concerned we have plans to introduce a dedicated Android app in the future to allow people to play more easily on the go, wherever they might be, and we are also going to be introducing all sorts of great bonuses and fun promotions which we encourage players to take advantage of by signing up with their email address.\nFor Bitcoin.com, we are branching out into many different aspects of the industry and our ultimate goal is to help promote Bitcoin adoption by having all the information and every tool which a user would need in the one place. To further that goal, all profits from our casino are reinvested into Bitcoin.com as a whole, so simply by playing on Bitcoin Games players are helping encourage Bitcoin awareness and adoption around the world!\nThe rise of Bitcoin gambling: popularity and competition\nOnline gambling has been one of the biggest scenes in Bitcoin, almost since its very appearance back in 2009. The anonymous hands-off approach of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has been an ideal match for all kinds of online casinos, whose users want to get in fast, win big and leave with their prize.\nAs a consequence, large fortunes have already been made in Bitcoin gambling, even with the industry being just over five years old. For example, the $11.5 mln acquisition of Satoshi Dice by Erik Vorhees back in 2013 has been regarded as one of the earliest, if not the first \u201cbig business buyout\u201d in the Bitcoin industry.\nWhen it comes to the players themselves, the largest reported win to date belongs to a person nicknamed Nakowa, who in 2013, managed to win $1.3 mln worth of Bitcoins.\nIt\u2019s no wonder that when stakes are this high, the competition becomes incredibly fierce. With new casinos being launched and others going out of business almost every week, it takes a truly exceptional offer to stand out.\nInstant deposits, withdrawals, and 39 available altcoins\nIn that regard, Bitcoin Games looks to be one of the strongest competitors of today. First of all, they offer the full range of expected casino games in one place, including poker, blackjack, roulette, craps, keno, slots and dice. While not a unique feature, it adds to the convenience of the service.\nThe approachability and ease of use are clearly one of the top priorities for the developers as evidenced by several other features. The players are able to enjoy instant deposit & play, with the funds being available for gambling as soon as they are sent to Bitcoin Games.\nThe instant withdrawal of winnings becomes available as soon as all prior deposits receive at least two confirmations on the Blockchain. Bitcoin Games also claims that there are no hurdles for withdrawals, which some of the less unscrupulous casinos commonly implement in order to prevent players from leaving with their prizes too fast.\nWithdrawals are instant and do not require approval in most circumstances, the exception to this being amounts larger than the funds in the site\u2019s hot wallet.\nOne crucial and unique feature is Bitcoin Games\u2019 integration with Shapeshift, an instant cryptocurrency exchange service. It allows users to play for Bitcoin by depositing an altcoin of their choice, out a list of 39 available cryptocurrencies.\nThis makes Bitcoin Games one of the only online casinos where you can easily deposit and place using such coins as Monero, Ripple, Steem, Zcash, and others.", "birthday": "2016-12-13T15:12:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-13 15:12:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 13}

We at Cointelegraph are badasses, just like the other 15,000 guests, 1,700 startups, 800 investors and 630 journalists who attended one of the leading startup and technology conferences in the world - Slush 2016.\nBuilding worldwide startup community\nThe history of Slush started in 2008 when a small group of Finnish entrepreneurs met over a pint of beer. A few months later it grew into a gathering of two hundred people, and look at it now! Having always been characterized by an incredible energy and enthusiasm, Slush aims to facilitate founder and investor meetings and build a worldwide startup community.\n\nJust to give you guys an idea of how huge this event actually is, here are some quick numbers:\n 30,000 square meters of venue; Six stages, where founders, investors and the media share their stories in fireside chats and keynotes; 260 startups at demo booths; 8,000 investor-startup meetings; and Hundreds of side events, dinners and roundtable sessions. \nThis year Slush has been more international than ever - about 60 percent of the attendees arrived from outside of Finland - from a total of 124 countries.\nNordic FinTech stars on how to democratize capital markets\nWith this variety of themes and events, we felt like a kid in a candy shop, feeling a little indecisive of where to go. Panel session FinTech Startups Democratizing Capital Markets got into our personal list of highlights of the event.\n\nAt the panel, Nordic FinTech stars have been looking into how FinTech is transforming the world of financial services, facilitating businesses, funding models, marketplace models and financing platforms.\nJohannes Asuja, managing director at Evli Investment Solutions and moderator of the panel session posed some very interesting questions to the speakers.\nFinTech is developing rapidly, it is transforming global markets. Unsurprisingly interest in FinTech, its latest developments and potential to disrupt the financial services industry is growing. The very fact that experts and professionals have gathered at Slush to talk about it demonstrates that there is a lot to talk about in order to facilitate moving forward.\nIndeed, it is important to take a look back once in awhile to see how things are developing, reconsider strategies to see the things that might have been overlooked and adjust the process to the most pressing needs.\nThe panelists, who included Perttu Jalkanen, co-founder and CCO at Arex, Lasse M\u00e4kel\u00e4, CEO at Invesdor, Kirsi Larkiala, Global FinTech Top 100 Influencer, Mikko M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4, director of business development at Zervant, Tuomas Toivonen, co-founder at Holvi and Sanyu Karani from Fundingbox, tried to find an answer to general questions. Such topics included a discussion of where FinTech is now and where it is moving, while also looking at more specific issues related to the funding of FinTech companies, the effects on customers and the potential of FinTech to facilitate development.\n\nLet\u2019s work together!\nOne of the key points that all speakers agreed on is that banks and FinTech companies need to collaborate. There was a time when investing in startups developing technology solutions for financial services seemed hindered, but the overcoming of the recent global banking crisis has opened up more space and possibilities for partnering.\nLasse M\u00e4kel\u00e4 says: \u201cBanks certainly had difficulties when it came to funding companies, especially small companies. The underinvesting of technology was obvious - banks had to pick up their own systems to be able to operate normally. But now banking is growing, a lot of things are happening in this area in Europe. What is clear, however, is that banks remain underserved, which is why a lot of FinTech companies are coming there.\u201d\nFinTech came along and it becomes clearer that it is guiding innovation, as there are a lot of companies on meaningful missions, aimed to take care of some foundational business projects. \u201cFinTech companies can do a lot of things,\u201d says Kirsi Larkiala. The important thing here is to establish a good partnership with the bank.\n\nTuomas Toivonen from Holvi, a Helsinki-based banking startup that provides entrepreneurs and small to medium-sized businesses with a range of business services as well as traditional banking through its online platform, says: \u00a0\u201cBBVA has a long track record of working with FinTech startups and helping them introduce their solutions in the industry. BBVA understands the digital world, they are able to help us nurture projects by giving us the necessary room to grow. We found a way to combine the advantages of being a FinTech player as well as being on board with one of the largest banks.\u201d", "birthday": "2016-12-08T17:10:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-08 17:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 8}

In the age of high-frequency trading, the time honored equilibrium in the feedback loop of pursuit, capture and escape is becoming increasingly distorted.\nLong and arduous is the process by which financial regulation is conceived and implemented, taking on the order of months to fully realize.\nThis is a classical procedure which traces its roots back to an age where commodities crossed the Atlantic on schooners and the code of conduct was scrawled out longhand with quill pens. In those days of yore, if legislation contained a failure or loophole it could be exploited only so many times before it was possible to stem the breach.\nOur digital age is described by, among other things, adaptive machine learning processes that are capable of executing transactions in fractions of a second. As such, while the time horizon during which legislative oversights might remain vulnerable has generally remained constant, our ability to exploit them has increased by a degree previously unimaginable.\u00a0\nFat cats vs. blind mice\nThe Flash Crash of 2010 was a trillion-dollar stock market collapse that started and ended during a period of approximately 36 minutes.\nIn his recent book \u2018Our Revolution,\u2019 Bernie Sanders prides himself on a filibuster which lasted eight hours. That means that while Bernie was so eloquently holding forth on the floor of the United States Senate, the American economy could have experienced more than 13 consecutive trillion-dollar stock market crashes.\nIt would seem that there is a fundamental discrepancy between the way our modern financial markets function and the way they are policed. The financial industry is fiercely competitive and encourages a Darwinian impetus to improvement. The legislative industry labors under no such compunctions. In the cat and mouse struggle previously alluded to, it seems the so-called \u201cfat cats\u201d have grown considerably more fleet than the \u201cblind mice\u201d of justice.\u00a0\nGet smart\nThe investigations of the Flash Crash were said to be prolonged due to the fact that regulators figuratively used the equivalent of bicycles in an effort to apprehend speeding Ferraris. In essence, regulations can be thought of as a \u201ccontract.\u201d\nMachine learning algorithms can grow and adapt in seconds or less, while regulation takes on the order of months or more. It would seem that were regulation to keep up it would need to be more fluid, more adaptable.\nHow could this be possible? Perhaps what is called for is a smart contract-based regulatory environment\u00a0that can adapt in accordance with a predetermined set of parameters, to the behaviors of market participants.\u00a0\nFCA tech sprint\nIt\u2019s an anomalous state of affairs that in the native land of Sir Jonathan Ive, Charles Babbage, Alan Turing, Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson, Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley and the Spice Girls that there are so precious few world renowned tech companies (should we count DeepMind?).\nIn fact, one of the only vibrant and globally competitive industries that remain in Great Britain is financial services. Accordingly, the Bank of England and the rest of the city are quite keen on keeping abreast of the emerging trends in so-called \u201cFinTech.\u201d\nIt stands to reason then that the Financial Conduct Authority recently organized their first Tech Sprint (viz. Hackathon), inviting innovators from around the world to come to Cambridge and demo the latest advances in the field.\u00a0\nFlash Crash can repeat itself\nOf the organizations in attendance \u2018eccenca GmbH\u2019 of Leipzig unanimously blew away those in attendance with the presentation of a framework pioneering a new architecture for logic based regulation.\nAt a high level, this equates to describing regulation in machine-readable computer code, a necessary prerequisite to smart contract based regulation. We find ourselves today in the undesirable situation of attempting to govern digital-age technology with depression-era legislation.\nFive years after the Flash Crash, traders can still manipulate and impact markets using automated trade systems that have only increased in sophistication.\nThe logic based corporate governance model of eccenca and other similar initiatives are leading the charge in achieving some semblance of parity in the struggle to maintain regularity in the global financial system.\nRipped from the headlines\nOne year ago the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of the United States established a regime of regulatory requirements circumscribing the requisite margin on trades between swap dealers and other firms that weren\u2019t routed through clearinghouses.\nThis policy as released at the time contained a glaring loophole which essentially constituted carte blanche for banks to shift the targeted swaps business overseas with impunity. It was five long months before that hole was identified and corrective measures were taken.", "birthday": "2016-12-05T15:18:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-05 15:18:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 5}

Following a breakout above the near-term local highs around $755 late last week, the bulls carried the price up to the even more critical $778 regional high level before getting rejected by sellers. Now the market is pulling back below $750 on what we believe to be profit taking by shorter-term players, a move which should help refresh the technicals in order to give the bulls a better shot at taking out the heavy medium-term resistance in the $770 \u2013 780 region. Although this consolidative pullback may be unwelcome by those who are overextended on the long side, we welcome it as a chance to jump back into a bull market at key near-term support.\nTo put the recent moves into context and prepare for what might be coming down the pike as we get closer to the new year, we take a look at the three-day chart once again as it remains a reliable roadmap for the medium to long-term technicals. We can see that price remains in, what appears to still be, an ascending triangle formation and could be forming an even larger cup and handle pattern off the June highs, both of which indicate the possibility of substantially higher prices in the not too distant future. Also, note that the 200-period SMA is now firmly in an uptrend, the A/D line continues to move higher thus confirming the medium-term bull market, and market structure remains ok despite the current deceleration within the supply (resistance) area.

Usually, under such price conditions, a period of growth is likely. Will there be a return to $14?\nETH/USD\nThe minimal target of the medium-term downward movement has been reached. That target is the bottom limit of the long-term flat, which has been there for almost six months. A new wave of the flat has been formed, which means that the price has two likely scenarios for future development: form a new wave of the flat upwards toward $14, or form a turn towards the decline. One of these scenarios will be confirmed by our technical analysis.\n\nIf we look at the intraday picture, it\u2019s clear that the large volumes near the key level of $8.3 have been sold out, and after that, they were bought back near the opposite key marks. That looks like a big seller\u2019s tactic. Of course, there may be several big bears, but their tactics are similar, so for the sake of simplicity we will assume that there is only one. Thus, the price has continued to rapidly fall and grow back again.\nIn the future, the scenario may repeat itself but on a larger scale. Although, last week the scenario of a possible upward movement was trending towards a flat and the downward movement towards a real trend, at the moment it\u2019s exactly the opposite.\nThe limit of the flat, which Ethereum\u2019s price has rebounded from several times already, is obvious to everyone and the traders expect a new rebound. This sentiment is confirmed by the large buy order volumes between $6.5 - $7. However, as we have already noted, the situation can repeat itself on a larger scale. If there is a seller on the market who can match that volume, Ethereum\u2019s price will crash to at least $4 - $5. It will continue falling until it hits a significant volume of buy orders, which will be unprofitable for the seller. After that, the price of Ether will rise back. If a big seller doesn\u2019t appear, ETH is in for a flat-like fall. In regards to the upward movement, for a more powerful growth Ether needs to break through the key level near $8.4. If the price goes beyond that point, it will mean that there is a big buyer on the market.

", "content": "Initial Coin Offerings have been extremely helpful in raising funds for cryptocurrency startups as a means of financial support. However, Adam Vaziri, a known legal counsel and 'FinReg' consultant, points at three key problems that he believes are negatively affecting the current ICO model.\nVaziri is the founder of Diacle and a member of the UK Digital Currency Association.\nIn a video\u00a0presentation to over a hundred crypto enthusiasts in the Barcelona Bitcoin community, he said that accountability, misrepresentation and the liquidity of tokens are issues that need to be addressed in order to improve the fundraising model.\nHe also suggested the need for an independent third party to monitor such a process.\nAccountability problem\nOften at times, founders say they will build the corporate structure once they acquire funding. However, when it comes to the actual ICO, founders or promoters are left receiving Bitcoins and Ether into a wallet they control and there is no legal entity that the purchaser is buying the tokens from.\nHe said:\n \"This is a very dangerous precedent to set. It is a bad idea for one person to have control over $10 mln of revenue and for entering into a contract where there is no legal entity behind it.\" \nA communications advisor for Blockchain projects, Dominik Zynis, agrees with Vaziri that on many occasions, ICOs do not have corporate structures, the corporate structures are not appropriate or they have a small group of keyholders.\nZynis notes in a chat with Cointelegraph that one of the organizations he advises, WINGS Foundations, which is presently running a backing campaign, is addressing the issue by empowering project DAO communities to use its platform with milestone releases of funds to ensure that the power is in the hands of backers.\nHowever, Zynis believes that Web-based crowdfunding problems cannot be easily addressed by traditional methods, saying the sheer number of ventures in existence will make it impossible, as the recent case of fake news on Facebook illustrates.\nThis is in response to Vaziri\u2019s claim about misrepresentation that statements made by founders are rarely verified by an independent source and this sometimes leads to promises that are unlikely to be fulfilled, at least in the way they are presented.\nDue diligence outsourcing to forums wrong\nVaziri states that while this could be a risk for the purchaser, it could be a clearance for the founders, as even if they don\u2019t need to be regulated for what they are doing or the security does not need to be registered in that situation, their representation to the public has to be correct.\nThis is important to them as they rely upon it so that they can enter into a contract with the issuer. Otherwise, an identified intent to mislead would expose the founders to fraud claims.\nThe legal practitioner also faulted a growing trend wherein ICOs outsource due diligence to Reddit and Slack forums saying such a move can only supplement and not replace standard due diligence. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe WINGS advisor notes that there is bound to be a risk of the unknown. He says:\n \"Certainly, there are often times whereby there are no ways to verify some statements or claims like - will drilling lead to the discovery of an oil field until the work is done? There will always be the risk of the unknown\u2026 but I often think of the question - what if \u201cthe DAO\u201d had submitted itself to WINGS? WINGS is a virtualized due diligence, valuation and control mechanism for projects and project backers.\u201d \nZynis adds:\n \u201cIf we can harness the power of people in Reddit and Slack and give them financial incentives, we can perhaps make sense of some of this crowd information into some intelligible signals and avoid sending $150 mln into a faulty contract.\" ", "birthday": "2016-12-07T13:47:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-07 13:47:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 7}

It was big enough to fill practically all the orders in the Poloniex buy side order book. \nThe Poloniex Augur market has bottomed at the price level of 0.0001 BTC for one REP despite the average price of 0.0035 in the previous period. \n \nPoloniex tweeted that they have been investigating the Augur matter but have been limited in what they could find because the trades in question were executed via an instant exchange service. \nFollowing Shen\u2019s money \nShen has been a strong supporter of Blockchain technology and one of the organizers of Shanghai\u2019s Global Blockchain Summit. He is a co-founder of Chinese VC firm Febushi, the first China-based venture capital firm that exclusively invests in Blockchain-enabled companies. \nThe hacking of Shen\u2019s account has been suggested to be a hijack by social engineers. \u00a0The kind of hackers who heavily rely on human interaction and trick people into breaking normal security procedures. Kraken reports that there have been more cases of cryptocurrency scene actors being victimized by mobile phone hijacking. \nAs earlier noted by Augur co-founder Jack Peterson, Shen\u2019s REP and ETH were reportedly dumped on the Poloniex exchange on the said day causing the price of ETH to tank to as low as $5.98, as the dollar value of Augur's digital asset Reputation (REP) also dropped to $2.09 - though they have both recovered according to CoinMarketCap. \n .@boshen1011 @joeykrug if anyone's curious why REP and ETH prices are tanking today, some shithead hacked @boshen1011 and dumped his ETH+REP  \u2014 Jack Peterson (@tensorjack) December 6, 2016 \n \nHuge transaction discovered \nCointelegraph has analyzed the contents of the blocks around the time when the money was stolen from Bo Shen\u2019s account and tried to track the transaction. During that period there was only one such transaction: \n \n-\u00a0https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5fb679e22336a634609fd4208df05e9e212f3d54d8ce73ff5ff40af75bbba937  \nIt can be seen here: 110,000.1446470998 REP. This is one of the biggest transactions since ICO - Augur network has an average of 20 transactions per hour. \nThe account belongs to one of the original investors - \u00a0this is evidenced by the fact that the money had been there since the time of ICO. \nThe first funds were received from Token Holder Address: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 119,000 REP in total. It is without any doubt that this is the culprit. It is also possible to see that not so long ago a transaction of 110,000 REP had been carried out - supposedly to the hacker\u2019s account. \nLet\u2019s start tracking now. \nHere's the hacker\u2019s wallet:\u00a0https://etherscan.io/token/REP?a=0xb08241488b1b3a4eafdb125c218cec7d086cfaa7 \nOut of that wallet, the funds were transferred in smaller amounts to various addresses. \nThe second line wallets held REP for no more than an hour. Subsequently, they were transferred to some high turnover wallets. \nA tweet from Poloniex claims that the money was exchanged on the instant digital asset exchange. \n We've been investigating the Augur matter. The trades in question were executed via an instant exchanger service, limiting what we can find.  \u2014 Poloniex Exchange (@Poloniex) December 6, 2016 \n \nIt is possible that the high turnover wallets mentioned above involve these exchanges.

A user was able to exchange a part of the stolen money before Changelly noticed that something was wrong. The exchange then blocked the remaining funds to ascertain the circumstances. \nKonstantin Gladych, Changelly\u2019s CEO says: \n \u201cWe have also contacted Jack Peterson regarding the hack and Poloniex, our partner. Now we are carrying out the investigation in cooperation with other exchanges.  We don\u2019t have any limits to the amount being exchanged, but the sum of REP was too large and looked suspicious. A part of it was exchanged automatically but the rest of it has been blocked and will be returned to the rightful owner, as the circumstances clarify.  In case of legal proceedings, we are ready to cooperate with the investigators.\u201d  \nErik Voorhees, CEO at ShapeShift\u00a0comments: \n \"Our policy is to publish every transaction that goes through the platform, so that funds cannot be obscured. As public observers have noted, it appears some of the stolen funds were traded at ShapeShift, along with other exchanges. Since we don't hold any customer funds, we cannot freeze accounts, however we blacklist addresses (and derivative addresses) which we believe are involved in thefts or fraud. \"  \nPortion of stolen funds liquidated \nIn an email to Cointelegraph, Augur\u2019s Tom Kysar maintains that the issue, which has been contained, is more about Shen. \nHe says: \n \u201cBo Shen was an early supporter and REP sale purchaser, but not a part of the Augur team. The situation is now under control.\"  \nHe adds: \u201cConsidering this revolves around Bo's personal holdings, we're not directly involved in this at the moment - however, we're receiving updates and staying in contact. It\u2019s appropriate to say that the hacker has taken credit for liquidating a portion of the stolen funds.

If this solution does indeed get adopted en-masse, it promises to solve the industry\u2019s cash-only problem.\nWhy no banking love for marijuana\nThe problem in the United States arises from the dichotomy in laws. While in many states the use of medical marijuana is now allowed, federal law still acts as a spanner in the wheel. The banking industry is thus wary of being on the wrong side of federal law and the industry is largely unorganized.\nConsumers who want to access medical marijuana in states where it is legal, have to either withdraw cash from an ATM or rely on businesses accepting credit or debit cards till the time they are not \u2018discovered\u2019 by the payment processing banks.\nCanPay App enables cashless purchase of medical marijuana\nCanPay, a Colorado based company, has recently released a debit payment application that promises to change all of that. Consumers can download the application and it can be connected to their checking accounts, which allows direct payment from the account to the retailer.\nThere are no debit or credit cards involved. In one fell swoop CanPay has basically solved the cash problem that accompanied the operation of a medical marijuana business.\nWe talked with CanPay CEO Dustin Eide who tells us:\n \u201cWith the conflicts between state and federal laws, financial institutions have been hesitant to provide financial services to the regulated cannabis industry. This means that many cannabis businesses either do not have access to any banking services or must hide the nature of their business to obtain access.\u201d \nHe adds:\n \u201cHowever, there are a number of financial institutions across the United States that have built cannabis banking programs around the Cole Memo and FinCEN Guidance (updated 2/14/2014), which combined provide the path for these institutions to offer legitimate banking options to cannabis businesses. To provide the CanPay payment services to retailers, we utilize a multi-state network of financial institution partners offering compliant cannabis banking programs. This helps ensure all purchases processed through the network are transacted as part of a compliant banking program.\u201d \nCanPay is opting to go traditional instead of Blockchain\nThe application that CanPay offers is currently only aimed at marijuana users but in principle this payment solution can be utilized by any merchant. The list of participating retailers is available here and can also be accessed through the CanPay app at CanPay App.\nWhile we would have loved to have seen a Blockchain or a cryptocurrency based solution, CanPay is a regular payment network. However as Dustin Eide says, Blockchain based attempts would be welcomed by his company as well.\nHe puts it:\n \u201cWe respect any attempt to create legitimate financial services solutions for the regulated cannabis industry, including those working with Blockchain technology.\u201d ", "birthday": "2016-11-30T14:15:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-30 14:15:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 30}

You know for sure what mining means, and if you have had a chance to mine Bitcoin back in the day, you have probably managed to make a profit out of it.\nBitcoin mining is becoming more competitive\nRemember the days when computer CPUs (central processing units) were widely used to mine Bitcoin? Miners quickly moved on to using the GPUs (graphical processing units), as it was discovered that they could offer more hashing power compared to CPUs - they were able to hash data 50 to 100 times faster and, which is important, consumed much less power per unit of work.\nNowadays, serious Bitcoin mining is carried out by dedicated Bitcoin mining hardware ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits), usually in thermally-regulated data centers with access to low-cost electricity. It is still technically possible to mine Bitcoin without those, but one obviously earns less.\nMining Bitcoin on a computer will cause more damage to the computer, compared to making a profit. If you would like to mine Bitcoin just to see how the mining process works, then go for it! But if you want to mine more effectively and keep on earning coins or mining shares, you\u2019ll probably need to invest into buying specialized hardware.\nBitcoin mining is becoming more difficult, and the competition is increasing. As demand surged, so did mining difficulty, resulting in the increase of Bitcoin\u2019s value. Other cryptocurrencies - e.g. Litecoin rise in popularity - are expected to encounter the same challenges.\nThings to consider\nEager to mine arbitrary amounts of Bitcoins? Slow down, there are a few things to consider before you start generating some digital cash. I say some because sadly you can\u2019t mine more Bitcoins than the ECB prints euro bills.\nThe first thing you\u2019re going to need to do is to decide on the hardware that will be used to mine Bitcoin. There are a few important factors to take into account when choosing a mining hardware.\nYour mining hardware performs a certain number of calculations trying to crack a transaction block, this number is indicated in the hash rate. The higher your hash rate, the more likely you are to solve a transaction block. To get rough information on hash rates for different hardware you can consult the Bitcoin Wiki\u2019s Mining Hardware Comparison page.\nWhen setting up to mine Bitcoin, bear in mind that mining hardware eats up large amounts of electricity, which is not provided for free. You might want to check your future hardware\u2019s energy consumption level just to make sure you invest in the most efficient Bitcoin mining hardware. Buying one that converts the most amount of electricity into Bitcoins would be ideal.\nNetwork difficulty - the metric which determines how hard it is to solve transaction blocks - is another key parameter to keep in mind. It varies according to the network hash rate and is likely to increase with new ASIC devices coming on the market.\nYou can input all parameters into a special mining profitability calculator to see how long it will take to pay back your investment and to begin making a profit.\nNow, what\u2019s on the market?\nCalculations look good and you are determined to start mining? You might want to turn to UFOMiners LLC, as they will surely provide you with the best advice on how to choose the best mining hardware.\nUFOMiners LLC was founded in 2014 with an aim to develop amazing cryptocurrency mining equipment. UFOMiners strives to be one step ahead of their competitors, therefore the company does not rely on third-party technologies and develops all of the components of their mining solutions independently. At the moment, their product selection includes Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and ZCash dedicated miners.\nThe Las Vegas-based company is about to introduce their latest innovation that is believed to be a game changer.\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, the company\u2019s spokesperson said:", "birthday": "2016-12-01T17:36:00+00:00", "date": "2016-12-01 17:36:00", "year": 2016, "month": 12, "day": 1}

Ireland Didn't For Most Of 1970 ", "content": "While traditional flights to safety in investing have focused on low risk return investments, it is a sign of the times that during the recent currency woes seen around the globe, people are turning to Bitcoin despite its reputation as being high risk.\nThis is most likely down to Bitcoin being unique in its ability to be used either as a store of value as well as a medium of exchange, while also leaving the investor in complete control of their investment. With no central authority, it cannot be affected by overnight bans, as we are \u00a0currently seeing with traditional fiat currency notes throughout the world.\nThe decentralized peer-to-peer design of Bitcoin means that it communicates in all languages and knows no borders. I believe the only way it can be stopped is by shutting down the entire global Internet.\nBitcoin has been fulfilling what it was created to do without fail for over eight years now and as long as it continues to fulfill the needs of investors and consumers, there will always be a demand for it. This is evident from the rise in price and transaction volumes, which is steadily growing, month after month, year after year.\nCashless society\nThe 50 year vision for a cashless society has never been closer, with larger banknotes from all parts of the world either banned or in the process of being banned. The EU has targeted the 500 euro note and India has removed the 500 and 1000 rupee notes. Australia is discussing removing the $50 and $100 dollar bills out of circulation, and the Australian Citibank became the first bank to declare it is no longer accepting coins or notes anymore.\nUBS analyst Jonathan Mott, said:\n \u201cRemoving large denomination notes in Australia would be good for the economy and good for the banks. Benefits would include reduced crime and welfare fraud, increased tax revenue and a \u2018spike\u2019 in bank deposits.\u201d \nThat little quote says a lot and people should take notice as it clearly states that the removal of fiat from society will benefit nobody but the banks themselves with a \u201cspike\u201d in deposits and the government with increased tax revenue.\nBanks play an important role in society and are meant to be here as a service to their customers. However, from watching the situation in Greece last year, where television reporters stood outside the doors of closed banks in Athens predicting armageddon, you would think we couldn\u2019t exist without them.\nIrish banking strike\nIn 1970 all banks in Ireland closed during a strike lasting six and a half months, which at the time was predicted to have a similar catastrophic forecast to that which occurred in Greece.\nThis strike began on the May 1 and lasted until Nov. 17, 1970.\nThe facts are contrary to what was expected and it had very little impact on the Irish people. Instead of panicking, the people of Ireland used their survival instinct and very rapidly discovered other ways for carrying out the functions previously performed by the banking industry.\nEconomist Michael Fogarty, who wrote the official report on the bank dispute, was quoted by the Irish Independent as saying that: \u201cthe services of the clearing banks proved by no means as indispensable as would have been expected before the dispute.\u201d\nOthers take the example of the Irish bank strike as evidence that much of what banks do is a \u201csocially useless activity.\u201d\nUndated cheques often endorsed over to others but never cashed, became a form of currency. When the supply of cheques dried up people wrote new ones on any available piece of paper, sometimes adding a postage stamp to give it an official appearance.

But such a movement could largely turn out to be speculation by big players, which will ultimately normalize the price towards its original position.\nETH/USD\nAround a month ago, we determined two scenarios for the development of the medium-term trend. ETC\u2019s price has formed a downward trend, after cancelling the upward option. The medium-term target on Ethereum has been almost reached. In regards to the short-term targets, the downward impulse has also been confirmed. After a rebound towards the key level of $10.30, Ether\u2019s price has failed to break through it, and has instead returned to the bottom mark. That is indicative of a big bear\u2019s presence on the market. Given that a large volume near $10.50 hasn\u2019t been bought out, the likelihood of an upward movement was lower than that of a fall. Thus, after a correction towards $10.30, a pretty good volume of buy stop orders has formed right up to $9.50. This volume exceeds that which has been present between $9.50 to $8.50. The majority of traders were counting on catching the start of an upward trend, which has allowed the opportunity for a big bear, and they naturally took advantage of it.\n\nThis entire situation provokes the majority of traders into listing sell orders. As we can see, the number of Ether sell stop orders significantly outweighs that of the buy orders.\nThe current situation with buy stop orders will be beneficial to a big bear. That is why if such a bear appears on the market, the volatility of Ether\u2019s price will grow quite significantly. This is because people usually sell at the peak of the downward trend in order to buy back at a cheaper price, and that, in turn, will provoke the growth of the price, which will quite likely be towards the original point. Movements of this kind are called \u201cfalse breakouts,\u201d because in such situations the price usually returns to the initial level about as quickly as it fell.\nBut for that scenario to form, the price has to break through a key level near $8.30, and without stopping there.\nIn that case, and if the situation with the buy stop orders doesn\u2019t change significantly, the minimal targets for the fall will be between $7.50 - $6.50.\nJudging by the sell stop orders, the most likely scenario for the price is a flat-like movement. That is why we should refrain from considering any kind of significant growth until Ether gets out of the flat zone by going beyond $10.50.\n", "birthday": "2016-11-29T14:00:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-29 14:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 29}

Now that you don\u2019t have any circulating cash, hey presto, you have a cashless economy. Welcome to the brave new India.\nCashless economy ahoy!\nIndians are discovering that without their familiar Rs.500 and Rs.1000 banknotes that made up nearly 86 percent of all circulating cash, life is very difficult indeed. Middle class and upper class Indians have now taken to debit cards and credit cards.\nIndia\u2019s Hindu Business Line Newspaper reported that there has been a surge of 65 percent in transactions of less than Rs.500 made through debit and credit cards, post the demonetization that occurred on Nov. 8.\nThey go on to say: \u201cOverall, the usage of debit cards has gone up 70 percent and of credit cards, by 40 percent, suggesting a sharp jump in first-time users.\u201d\nPart of this surge can be attributed to the fact that the government has waived off charges that are usually associated with these types of \u2018cashless\u2019 transactions.\nShadowy wallet operator capitalizes on the mess\nThe post-demonetization mess has been beneficial to one company in particular called PayTM, a wallet operator that is funded by China\u2019s Alibaba group.\nA day after the demonetization was announced, the wallet provider took out full page advertisements in major Indian newspapers thanking Prime Minister Modi, with the advertisment\u2019s even featuring a gigantic image of the bearded PM.\nIronically, PayTM has been mired in controversy as India is also waging a \u2018war on Chinese goods.\u2019 The Diwali festival, which is celebrated across India, had Indians shunning goods \u2018made in China\u2019 as India\u2019s northern neighbour continues to side with Pakistan over various issues including the Himalayan dispute in Jammu and Kashmir.\nFirstpost recently covered how the Alibaba Group and its affiliate Ant Financial, have supported PayTM with funding to the tune of $680 mln.\nThe same story had PayTM\u2019s Founder and Chief Executive Vijay Shekhar Sharma defending his enterprise by saying: \u201cWe are as Indian as Maruti is...We are 'India story' in every sense whatsoever.\"\nShekhar was referring to Maruti-Suzuki, the manufacturer of India\u2019s iconic Maruti cars that are ubiquitous on the nation\u2019s roadways.\nHorde to be cashless first\nThere are now numerous parts of India that are competing to be completely \u2018cashless.\u2019 In fact, if shunning the use of paper money were an Olympic sport, India would perhaps be a serious contender for gold.\nOne such instance can be seen in the village of Akorda, the home state of Prime Minister Modi.

Here an SMS-based payment system enables villagers to carry out transactions and the rate of adoption has been impressive, with close to 60 percent using the system.

Simplifying home ownership in Hong Kong is therefore a prime concern for the Hong Kong government, which has undertaken a number of measures in the last few years to make home ownership both affordable and easy. \u00a0\nThe Nikkei Asian Review reported that as recently as early November, the Hong Kong government raised stamp duty to cool down the boiling Hong Kong housing market. This measure of the government was mainly aimed at outsiders, whom had been driving up home prices.\nNow the government is toying with Blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, to make it easier for Hong Kong residents to have access to mortgages as well.\nBlockchain can simplify complexities\nA proof of concept report published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute, covers issues related to Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) - an example of which is Blockchain - and aims to provide the FinTech industry in Hong Kong with a study of the benefits, risks, key features and potential of the technology.\nThe report looks at the potential of DLT across mortgage loan applications, trade finance and digital identity management. Of particular interest is the mortgage loan application process, where DLT can accelerate things and remove complexities.\nThe report states: \u201cBanks need fast and accurate information about the estimated value of a property in order to make good credit decisions. However, communication between banks, law firms and valuation firms remains a largely paper-based and (sometimes) error-prone process. A DLT network that connects these participants could therefore be helpful for them, for example by enabling them to confidently share copies of digitised valuation reports and legal documents or even transfer titles, thus reducing the time and cost of transactions.\u201d\nHow Hong Kong envisions the future of mortgages", "birthday": "2016-11-25T16:18:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-25 16:18:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 25}

This is a reason why Bitcoin mixers - Eg.

You also have to trust the company not to maintain logs of all the mixing transactions that take place.

Monero uses ring signatures to make it difficult to map inputs and outputs. Monero soared in value in September 2016, when it caught the fancy of Dark Web users.

A project that will change the very world that we live in. The Internet has come to define the age that we currently live in, but can the same be said of Bitcoin? Has Bitcoin been an empty promise? Well, the truth is that we need to dig deeper into that question, and more importantly, we need to ask that question.\nA zealous missionary base\nThe problem with Bitcoin is the people who embrace it. Bitcoin attracts a fierce and zealous base, who are unlikely to encounter any criticism or see opportunities where there are aplenty. There does exist various applications for Bitcoin with its pan-global availability, non-political nature and ease of deployment, but are they really being explored?\nThe United Nations Research Institute for Social Development published a working paper titled \u201cHow can cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology Play a Role in Building Social and Solidarity Finance\u201d in January 2016. It was authored by Brett Scott. Scott writes: \u201cOne nascent phenomenon related to Blockchain technology is the emergence of what might be called techno-libertarian evangelism \u2014 the presence of Blockchain \u201cmissionaries\u201d in developing countries articulating a technology-as-saviour and markets-as-saviour gospel alongside an anti-state message.\"\nFor example in Ghana, a group called Africa Youth Peace Call organized a 2015 Blockchain Land Title Summer Liberty and Entrepreneurship Camp to discuss how land registry can be moved from state institutions to Blockchain ledgers. The group\u2019s stated objective is in \u201cteaching free-market ideas and skills to the people of Africa, \u201dbut despite appearing as a Ghanaian organization, most of the group\u2019s board are foreigners, including American free-market economists Ken Schoolland, Warren Coats and Louis James, and libertarian activist Michael W. Dean (Africa Youth Peace Call 2015).\u201d\nThe reluctance of Bitcoin evangelists to work with state structures is actually a hindrance rather than an enabler for Bitcoin as a currency. It also poses a question if ideology triumphs over the larger goal of distributing Bitcoin into the hands of everyone.\nConsensus leads to status quo\nWe have covered the capacity constraints of Bitcoin in detail but it has also led to disillusionment and disappointment with the cryptocurrency, including its former backers, Mike Hearn being one of them. Mike, who was a senior developer working on Bitcoin and a former chair of the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s Law and Policy Committee, aired his disappointment with Bitcoin in a Guardian article:\n \u201cWhat was meant to be a new, decentralized form of money that lacked \u2018systemically important institutions\u2019 and \u2018too big to fail\u2019 has become something even worse: a system completely controlled by just a handful of people.\u201d \nWhen people can\u2019t agree on what course of action the currency should take for its future growth and it is facing bottlenecks as it is now, the only course open is to continue along the same path. Overall, it raises the question of whether Bitcoin is sustainable.\nBitcoin has failed in its goals\nAlthough Bitcoin has been around now for nearly a decade, we must now ask ourselves the question, what really does it have to show for itself? Sure the technology behind Bitcoin has been adopted globally and there are plenty of projects that are being built around the Blockchain, but what of Bitcoin itself? Has Bitcoin really unleashed the revolution that it promised it would? The big banks are still around, so are the wire companies like Western Union and Moneygram.\nIn fact, many of the people that Bitcoin was supposed to put to pasture have now adopted the Bitcoin tech and are still around. So the libertarian vision of a decentralized currency run on cryptographic democracy has not really materialized. Instead, we are still living in a world of governments, banks and big financial services businesses.\nCommon people, the kind that was supposed to use Bitcoin, are still probably using checking accounts, sending money by WU or using a debit card issued by Visa or Mastercard. Bitcoin for them is way too complex and has an aura of mystery surrounding it.\nWe are all too dumb or smart for Bitcoin\nYou could argue about it either way but the end result is the same. You could say that people are way too dumb to adopt Bitcoin or Bitcoin is way too complicated for most people to use. The end result - not many people use it.

The network\u2019s two main implementation clients - Geth and Parity - went out of sync, accidentally creating two separate chains operating in parallel.\nWhat happened?\nThe network\u2019s accidental split is largely a result of a very recent network upgrade.

Intrigued about this application, Cointelegraph spoke to Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, CEO and founder of Bitnation.\nCointelegraph: Could you explain the rationale behind Smart Love?\nSusanne Tarkowski:\u00a0We wanted a simple and fun end user application to focus energy around building the Pangea Jurisdiction. Marriage is an ideal candidate because there\u2019s a real need for it in the LGBT, inter-faith and polyamorous communities around the world, and most components you need to create a functional jurisdiction can be found in a robust marriage contract - like the ability to choose code of law, arbitrator, create an escrow, sign and timestamp the contract, etc.\nCT: You got married on the Bitnation platform, was it an experimentation of Smart Love?\nST: I would say everything we\u2019ve done up till now - the ID, Public Notary, Citizen and Embassy Networks, etc - has been an experiment/early proof-of-concept of the Pangea Jurisdiction. A testing ground, if you like. The marriage itself is serious, James and I are very committed to each other - and to Bitnation. We just moved from the UK to Amsterdam together and got a beautiful puppy.\nCT: Why is it that Smart Love wants to establish moderate barriers to entry and tough barriers to exit?\nST: You can have a relationship with someone without getting married. The purpose of marriage is really security \u2014 the knowledge that the time, energy and emotions you invest into building something together is a worthwhile undertaking \u2014 particularly if you intend to do \u2018high-risk\u2019 things, such as purchase real estate or have children together. Therefore it\u2019s good to have a moderate barrier to entry \u2014 so people can\u2019t just do it Vegas style night out - but it actually has to go through a process.\nThe marriage must be possible to end, of course, but it should come with some considerable hassle, so people don\u2019t simply walk out and give up on it because of a minor obstacle. You could compare it with the process of getting a tattoo - though obviously tattoos don\u2019t have much emotional, logistical or financial effects on your life.\nCT: Any particular reason Bitnation chose to have Smart Love on the Ethereum Blockchain?\nST: Because Ethereum is optimised for Smart Contracts, which is a key requirement for the Pangea Jurisdiction. However, once Rootstock is more evolved, we hope to be compatible with Rootstock and the Bitcoin Blockchain as well.\nCT: How do you see Smart Love\u2019s chances in the Ethereum Hackathon?\nST: I\u2019m not very concerned about winning \u2014 that\u2019s not why we are participating in . Our aim is to leverage the energy and infrastructure of the camp to engage the community in a meaningful conversation on what\u2019s required for a Blockchain jurisdiction, and use Smart Love as a fun and tangible way to create a demo end user application for it.\nBelow is an outline of some of the main components in the longer Smart Love writeup, which Bitnation would like to use to start a community wide discussion about:\nWikipedia defines a jurisdiction as the practical authority granted to a legal body to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility.

While the implications of the scale have not been made clear, I am 99 percent certain that there has been a massive breach of two factor authentication protocols, and that is why you see Google and Microsoft publicly lambasting each other.\u201d\u00a0 \nBates explains that, based on hands-on experience in fighting the cyber-security war, that most of the major breaches occur long before the media pick them up. This he says, makes it difficult to differentiate when it is a warning about an impending breach or an attempt to keep a breach quiet to avoid panic.\nBates continues by saying that the social engineering and access control aspects of security were not taken as seriously. \u201cYou have people in executive positions who know nothing about cyber-security making decisions based on line-item budgets. In fact, the Keynesian approach to capital became the bane of \u201csecurity\u201d in tandem with too many uninformed executives,\u201d he says.\nThe human factor\nAccording to McAlister, what his company brings forward isn\u2019t an overhaul of the entire process. He explains that their focus is on an effective and functional upgrade of the already existing system, which will allow for a seamless transition from the old to the impending new.\n\u201cThere is no reinventing the wheel, it is a simple upgrade,\u201d says McAlister. \u201cBanks, unfortunately, are unable to use this technology to offer their customers due to some of the flaws the Blockchain has as part of its design. We spent 12 months on working on a way to ensure banks can offer this legally and practically and, most important, cost effectively to their customers. We believe we have achieved this and we expect to have completed development by July 2017.\u201d\nBates, on the other hand, advocates for a cultural overhaul within the cyber security network. Bates points out that the major factor behind the unreliable existing system is the human factor. \u201cToo many humans will put themselves and others at risk by taking shortcuts around security protocols,\u201d he says.\nHe concludes by noting that despite how important it has become to upgrade the encryption, there must be a change in attitude by humans in order to achieve proper security within the ecosystem.\nSecurity is paramount\nMcAlister continues by explaining that this technology is essentially providing a cyber security jacket on all things IoT, with partnerships that connect in private with their IBE 3.0 security as well as their security layers.

After this wave ends, the medium-term structure will begin to form. There will be a good chance for increased volatility.\nETH/USD\nThe first wave of almost any trend is usually formed by big traders. By pouring in big capital, they provoke the mass of small traders into either selling or buying an asset. Trading volume usually falls at key levels of any trend, because the majority of traders don\u2019t know where the price is going to go. Because of that, those that do make the first step are clearly expecting something, and have access to big money. After the first wave, the picture of buy and sell stop orders becomes clearer, upon which one can tell what is the most profitable potential situation for the large player. In our case, the first wave of the short-term trend was between $11.5 - $10.5. After the price has fortified within the second upward wave, the third one has followed, during which the big trader was collecting his profits. The third wave has stopped near $9.5, and now the scenario may repeat itself.\n\nJudging by the buy and sell stop orders, we can predict that if the big trader starts selling Ether again, it will only be profitable until $7. After that, the picture of stop orders is repeating, albeit on a larger scale. That is why if the price fortifies near $7, there will be a chance for a fall towards $5 or lower. In regards to a potential upward trend, in case of Ether\u2019s price breaking through $10.3, it will likely head towards $13 - $14, because after buying up a large volume near the key level of $10.3, it would be reasonable to keep buying until large orders begin again, which happens exactly at $13 - $14. In that case, the big trader will be able to make a profit.\nThat means that $10.3 is the decisive point, or a key level for the development of the medium-term trend. The basis of the last short-term wave is near that level, which is why it is considered the last one. That is also confirmed by the technicals - the Fibonacci retracement and the diagonal channel are intersecting at $10.3. Thus, in order to grow, Ethereum has to fortify at $10.3 and form a turn to growth. Under such conditions, there will be a good chance for an upward trend towards $13 - $14.", "birthday": "2016-11-22T10:40:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-22 10:40:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 22}

While our bias remains generally bullish for the time being, we realize the market could stay around for awhile first. \nLast week we saw a somewhat surprising continuation of the near term rally up towards the $755 level where sellers began to move in to put a cap on price. Following that local top, price began to show signs of diminishing momentum on some bearish formations, which led to the sell-off we saw yesterday morning in the markets. Many traders are attributing this most recent pullback solely to the drama between Core and Unlimited, which could very well have been a catalyst for the move, however the technicals were telegraphing the need for such a move going back to Thursday of last week. Now that near term support has been found in the $710 range, the market is forming some rather unorthodox patterns which indicates to us that there remains some indecision at these prices. While we continue to think the downside risks are relatively limited, we would not be surprised to see slightly lower prices prior to a test of the highs, mainly due to the near term technicals. \nSpeaking of technical conditions, we return to the daily chart today for a closer look at the medium term outlook, going into what is a holiday shortened week for U.S. players - Thanksgiving. First of all, we can see that price is still in the upper supply area, despite spiking out of it briefly yesterday, and this has created, what could be considered, a rising wedge formation. This is typically a bearish pattern that results in a breakdown below the lower trendline, as happened on the sell-off over this past weekend, which is given even more credence when combined with still overbought and bearishly divergent momentum indicators. Additionally, price remains outside of the volume profile value area, the point of control (PoC) is still well below the market and trading volumes need to pick up on USD exchanges before a breakout.

", "content": "Apparently, the competition in the Blockchain business industry is heating up. Goldman Sachs, one of the original members of R3 Consortium, and Banco Santander announced that they will no longer continue exploring the potential of Blockchain technology as members of the consortium.\nReasons for the firm\u2019s decision to discontinue their connections with R3 Consortium remain unclear, as well as whether these decisions are somehow connected.\nKristian G\u00e5rder, a representative from Nordic R3 member SEB, says:\n \u201cMembers will obviously worry if some R3 members seek patents that we have discussed together. Now we are beginning to see alliances form. The risk is that Corda is not used by all the banks. If that happens its benefit will be severely limited. It is a huge challenge to get 65 banks to cooperate.\u201d \nCompetition is heating up as Blockchain solutions come closer to reality\nSeeking to save money by making financial operations faster, more efficient and transparent, banks and financial institutions set on a race to develop innovative products using the distributed ledger technology. Earlier this year, R3 Consortium announced that it was working on a platform developed specifically for financial institutions. R3\u2019s technology, called Corda, is hoped to become the industry standard, allowing firms to build products on top of it.\n\u201cWe want other banks and other parties to innovate with products that sit on top of the platform, but we don\u2019t want everyone to create their own platform because we\u2019ll end up with lots of islands that can\u2019t talk to each other,\u201d says James Carlyle, R3\u2019s chief engineer.\nHowever, that is exactly what happened. As the R3 applied for a patent for Corda, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have turned in another direction and applied for their own Blockchain patents. It became a contentious issue within the consortium.\nFollowing their own paths\nGoldman\u2019s broken relationship with R3 does not mean that the firm is no longer interested in Blockchain. On the contrary, it will continue to work with and develop its own distributed ledger technology.\n\u201cIt will play a transformative role in the way financial institutions transact globally,\u201d says Paul Walker, global co-head of technology at Goldman, as he shares his enthusiasm about the potential of Blockchain technology to revolutionize the industry.\nSantander has also been working on its own Blockchain projects. The financial giants, along with Ripple and a number of other large banks - including UniCredit, Standard Chartered, Westpac and Royal Bank of Canada - co-founded an interbank group for global payments based on Blockchain. Earlier this year it tested a mobile app using distributed ledger technology for international payments.\nWho is in control?\nIt remains unclear why Goldman Sachs chose not to continue with R3. \u201cI have no reason to believe it is about patents. There possibly is a lot at play,\u201d commented Marc Kaufman, partner at Reed Smith.\nAnother reason could possibly lay in the pursuit for control inside the consortium. In May this year, R3 began a fundraising campaign seeking to raise $200 mln, that would have granted 90 percent of the firm\u2019s equity to its member banks, with 10 percent retained by R3.\nThe consortium\u2019s original member companies would have equal rights to participate in the deal, while other members would have the opportunity to contribute. The opening bid was set at $150 mln, an amount raised by its member banks - with potential support from outside investors, which would redistribute ownership to 60:40 between investors and R3.\nApparently, Goldman Sachs sought more leverage, which would have given them more powerful tools for control. Therefore it refused to chip in for a $150 mln Series A funding round.", "birthday": "2016-11-22T15:05:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-22 15:05:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 22}

Close to 400 mln people in China conduct most of their payments using their smartphones. China\u2019s overall business in information technology is a market of well above $300 bln, and it is estimated that more than 700 mln Chinese have access to the Internet. So any law impacting the online space - cybersecurity included - will make ripples in the way China does business. \u00a0\u00a0\nThat\u2019s why its new cybersecurity law - due to take effect in June of next year - is particularly alarming. It is part of an ongoing government program to reinforce China\u2019s cybersecurity, and arguably targets non-Chinese hackers.\nBut it comes amidst continuous tensions between the U.S. and China, not just in terms of cybersecurity - each country has accused the other of hacking - but with trade, the economy and, of course, the U.S. election, which will inevitably change how business is done between the two nations. The law appears to be counterproductive in several ways.\nChinese firms benefit\nFirst, as the law sets forward, important network equipment and software will have to receive government certifications. This means that specific pieces of intellectual property or technical features will have to be divulged, which could easily be passed on to Chinese companies by the regulators behind cybersecurity.\nIt shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that the Chinese state has tremendous power and plays a critical role in economic plans. Government interference is much more prevalent than in Western nations. Under the veil of cybersecurity, regulators will have access to proprietary information that could benefit Chinese firms at the expense of foreign companies. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe type of businesses most at risk will be those with special hardware and systems for network management. But it could even include data from ATMs. New generation ATMs have a much higher level of connectivity with mobile integration and face recognition. This makes them more vulnerable to hacking and means confidential devices and information will have to be used for protection, and under this law, that creates a big entry place for government snooping.\nCritical areas\nThis law is also counterproductive because companies gathering data, in so-called \u201ccritical areas,\u201d will have to store that data inside China.\nAt this stage, the definition of \u201ccritical\u201d is worryingly broad. Complying with this requirement will force international firms to make expensive investments to build duplicate facilities within China. This is in total contradiction with the free flow of data, expected to swell in 2020 after the introduction of 5G.\nInternational companies will have to weigh this risk against the opportunity to conduct business in China. China has had a long reputation for \u2018copying\u2019 without getting insider access, and this law will only strengthen the ease in which China\u2019s business sector can review competition.\nFor international companies there is no easy way forward, as the choice is black or white. Either foreign companies will comply, knowing China has a way to peek into what previously was private, or they will choose to stand by principles of privacy at the risk of being excluded from the Chinese market.\nDespite the challenging dilemma, companies are likely to comply and give in to China\u2019s demands. The market is too huge and far too ripe for future growth, especially when compared to more stagnant outlooks in Europe and the U.S.\nNon-tariff barriers\nIn addition to creating barriers for international business in China, this kind of legislative move goes completely against innovation. It could well be considered to be part of what is called \u201cindigenous innovation\u201d in China.", "birthday": "2016-11-23T16:05:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-23 16:05:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 23}

When fiat currencies come under pressure, it is only natural for people to look for alternatives.

Take for example the Indian rupee, which is trading at historic lows since the Modi government in India unveiled demonetization on the midnight of Nov. 9, 2016.\nEver since then, the rupee has been hit rather badly. On Nov. 24, the rupee hit a record low of 68.85 against the U.S. dollar during the intraday trade on Thursday, according to the Economic Times.\nThis was the fifth losing session for the Indian currency. The Economic Times writes: \u201cSentiment in forex market turned highly weak due to consistent selling by foreign investors against the backdrop of demonetization and renewed concerns over Fed interest rate hike.\u201d\nIf we look at the overall losses since the crazy policy of withdrawing 86 percent of Indian rupees from the market was unleashed by the government, the Indian currency has lost 2.5 percent of its value against the dollar.\nSo how is Bitcoin doing in India? We have covered this in great detail but needless to say it is trading at a premium. At the Indian currency exchange Unocoin, one Bitcoin was available for Rs. 65,748 - $955 - as against the price elsewhere which was around $741.08.\nTurning Bolivars into Bitcoins\nElsewhere Bitcoin has also done well in times of uncertainty. In Venezuela, which has a dying currency, people are taking to Bitcoin.\nAs the Quartz reports:\n \u201cWhen a national currency is tanking as badly as the bol\u00edvar, a stateless cryptocurrency that\u2019s gaining in value suddenly sounds pretty appealing. It looks like at least some Venezuelans are turning their bol\u00edvar into Bitcoins to not only escape the spiral of devaluation in the state-issued, or fiat, currency, but to reap the profits of a Bitcoin price that\u2019s been buoyant all year.\u201d \nWhy Bitcoin makes sense\nThe natural question to ask is why Bitcoin is such a good hedge against risks that affect specific geographies and countries?\nWell one thing about Bitcoin, that all of us are aware about, is that it is pretty much seamless.

Blockchain, Bitcoin and FinTech are included in the Self-driving Society theme.\n\u201cThere are interesting things happening in financial technology currently, and I believe FinTech in general has not been highlighted enough as a major theme in our previous events,\u201d Laurikainen explains to Cointelegraph.\n\u201cGlobal remittances, mobile banking, Blockchain and cryptocurrencies, to name a few, are transforming the global financial system and it is important that we highlight these topics in Slush,\u201d he adds.\n \u201cThere will be discussions and keynotes about Blockchain and FinTech, networking meetup sessions focusing on FinTech in the Engine Room, and also founder stories on the Founder stage.\u201d \nFounder Stage is the arena committed for the founder stories, whereas Engine Room hosts networking and gathering events from different fields. There is also a new intimate location for Q&A sessions called Speaker Studio, allowing the attendees to continue the discussion with the speakers after their talks.\nThe themes and tracks are covered on all of the stages and structured on the agenda under the following:\n The Mind of an Entrepreneur is the main theme of the event. By having founders share stories about their hardest moments, we want to raise awareness about how challenges are a normal part of entrepreneurial life. This theme covers the topics of Startup Academy and Design. The next 100 years of your life covers the topics of Biotech, Education and Work, Health & Well-being and Science. Survival Plan for Planet Earth covers topics such as FoodTech, CleanTech & Energy, Social Entrepreneurship and Space. Augmenting the Real Life covers Artificial Intelligence & Robotics, Gaming & Entertainment, Music, Virtual Reality & Augmented Reality. Self-driving Society covers B2B software & Internet of Things, Cybersecurity, FinTech & Blockchain, Mobility & Smart Cities. \nWho are the speakers?\n2,000 startups, 800 venture capitalists and 700 journalists from over 100 countries are expected to attend Slush this year. As for the key speakers, the most exciting ones are perhaps:\n Daniel Ek, \u201cThe Most Important Man In Music\u201d, founder of Spotify Chris Sacca, investor in Twitter, Instagram and Uber Crown Prince Haakon of Norway Steve Jurvetson, managing director at Draper Fisher Jurvetson Joel Spolsky, CEO & co-founder at Stack Overflow Sebastian Siemiatkowski, founder & CEO of Klarna Danae Ringelmann, co-founder of Indiegogo. Dave McClure, venture capitalist & founding partner at 500 Startups \nAltogether 137 speakers have been announced so far. Most of them are founders, startup team members, researchers, or specialists. \u201cI'm very excited about different VR/AR related new startups and showcases we will have at Slush,\u201d notes Laurikainen. \u201cI believe 2016 is the year virtual reality is truly introduced to the masses, with larger companies coming out with their own VR-headsets for consumer use. This will be seen at Slush 2016.\u201d\nBlockchain this, Blockchain that, plus FinTech and a bit of Bitcoin\nBeing included in the main theme of the Self-Driving Society, FinTech challenges seem to be addressed through the question of \u201cAre we happy to give more control to machines, and at what cost?\u201d The experts that will try to answer it are the following:\n Jutta Steiner, Ethcore Thomas Cont\u00e9, Microsoft Brian Behlendorf, Hyperledger Elizabeth Stark, co-founder and CEO at Lightning Paul Puey, Airbitz Jacob deGeer, founder of iZettle Aage Reerslev, founder of Wrapp Roelant Prins, CCO at Adyen \nIn addition to this, representatives from Stripe and executives and venture arms from global financial institutions will have their say.", "birthday": "2016-11-24T15:15:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-24 15:15:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 24}

But is this a blip, a decline, a correction, or is it a natural part of a technology maturing or are there more sinister reasons?\nGreat run\nUntil recently, Blockchain had enjoyed a great run in 2015 and 2016. Bitcoin and Ethereum have been well up year after year, which has coincided with Zcash setting new records and the big tech boys Microsoft, IBM and Amazon opening up for Blockchain business.\nI have been hanging out with a wide range of entrepreneurs that have had their own particular Blockchain epiphany and calling to build their version of Blockchain.\nI have been in the tech industry for 35 years and have personally experienced many waves of technology, so here is my take on what is really going down in the Blockchain community.\nFirstly, the majority of the entrepreneurs that have created their own particular forked version of Blockchain are \u2018geeks\u2019 in the sense that they are Phd computer scientists, cryptographers and data scientists, and I love these guys. Then you have corporate managers that have functional expertise and respond to a personal calling to start their own business and become a tech entrepreneur. But how much real world business expertise do they have to run a business beyond initial start up?\nSecondly a large number of successful start-ups have secured Seed or even Series A in 2015 and 2016, and quickly burned through the cash building cool stuff, forking the code again, building labs and hiring reclusive and expensive developers and coders. Feels like kids playing with the latest gadgets, who are losing focus of the end goal to monetize a return for investors.\nThirdly many of these start-ups are convinced that the way to go, in an Open Source Libertarian world, is essentially to sell Proof of Concepts for a few hundred thousand, given that the end user world is not yet ready for commercial mainstream adoption and rolling out production level Blockchain solutions - platforms - that create \u00a0ongoing revenue streams and the creation of second tier Blockchain Service companies.\nFourthly, several owner/entrepreneurs I have met are naive and obsessed with maintaining the open source mantra and determined to give their developed code away for free. Some have no plans for monetization and don\u2019t even know who has downloaded their code, whilst others haven\u2019t grasped the concept of making a return. However, maybe they are the clever ones and have convinced investors to part with cash because the investors wouldn\u2019t even know what Blockchain, Solidity, LLP and Serpent code looked like, even if it hit them in the face.", "birthday": "2016-11-20T13:15:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-20 13:15:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 20}

Most importantly is the opportunity to programme and connect with the world in new and exciting ways.\nPrimary uses\nToday there are at least 800 cryptocurrencies, and within five years there may be 5,000 to 10,000 in use. There are two principal uses for cryptocurrencies, or three depending on whether you include Initial Coin Offerings or ICOs used for crypto-crowdfunding.\nThe first is the creation of an exchange traded digital currency like Bitcoin, Ripple, Litecoin or Dogecoin that we created with a trading purpose for speculation and accumulation.

It is helping millions of Indians to transfer money in India without passing through intermediaries or banks, especially as people in the high liquid market are looking to sell their Bitcoins in India.\nGaurav says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cWell, no doubt that what is happening in India will boost the Bitcoin price in the long term.

But then we remembered that we are building trustless systems. The whole point of things like multi-sig wallets is that you don't have to trust people, you can trust the mathematics and processes. We did underestimate the impact of the project's past reputation on our communication efforts, but we believe smart investors look at the tech and the actual system design, and the team building the system. In communicating our development efforts on Youtube, and becoming very vocal on Reddit and Twitter, I think we already changed the perception of what Arcade City is and can be.\u201d\nThis decentralization was always part of the greater\u00a0Arcade City plan, according to David:\n \u201cWe\u2019d always planned for the Arcade City ecosystem to split into multiple entities. Everyone involved is incentivized for the success of the token sale to properly launch our decentralized ecosystem. We\u2019ll figure out the service provider details after the core product and network are on a solid, independent trajectory.\u201d \nCrowdfund passes minimum, exceeds 62,000 Ether\nTo fund the completion of the next version of the app, which will run based off Ethereum smart contracts, Arcade City has launched a crowdfund via sale of ARC tokens, which are planned to be integral to payments within the app itself. The current crowdfund total has exceeded 62,000 Ether, nearing a $620,000 value. Jenn Williams, Arcade City council member, is satisfied with the progress of the token sale so far:\n \u201cI'm really pleased with the progress of the ARC token sale. We have reached the minimum raise needed to provide users with a solid v2 app that will be fueled by the ARC tokens minted that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain.\u201d \nDavid is similarly pleased with the progress of token sales, especially because of its grassroots nature, eschewing approaching veteran cryptocurrency investors in favor of targeting non-technical investors:\n \u201cWe\u2019re definitely happy with the progress so far. We intended this to be a grassroots token sale, not like other projects that spend months beforehand courting whales and exchanges. I respect that approach but it\u2019s just not our style. We\u2019ve got a large community of drivers and riders built up over ten months and we wanted to get them set up first. We\u2019ve built a hungry audience of non-technical rideshare users who were excited to buy Ethereum-based tokens for the first time. Now that we\u2019ve got them on board, we\u2019re beginning our outreach to the broader Ethereum community. We see Arcade City as potentially the \u2018killer app\u2019 of Ethereum, and it\u2019s important to have a critical mass of community stakeholders incentivized for us to succeed.\u201d \nDespite past financial reputation concerns, investors feel confident\nConcerns abounded regarding Arcade City\u2019s viability, including from original angel investor Roger Ver, because of alleged mishandling of funds and developmental delays. This has led to a degree of potential investor trepidation regarding the token sale. However, several investors have come forward to state their confidence in the project. Daniil Gorbatenko, a PhD candidate in economics at Aix-Marseille University originally from Russia and a libertarian crypto-enthusiast, believes that the project has moved far along enough to be trusted, citing an available test app demonstrating current progress, and believes that the project may be one of the most broadly successful Blockchain-based technologies:\n \u201cIt looks like the first project which could allow Blockchain technology to be used widely outside the community of crypto enthusiasts.\u201d \nTor Hylbom, potential investor from California, notes the caution from other investors with the crowd sale, but also sees the opportunity in being one of the few brave investors:\n \u201cThe sale is slower than I had anticipated, but I'm not surprised and not disappointed. Since the supply is fixed, the fewer tokens issued, the larger my share of the total market cap. I want a successful sale, because it will provide funds for the development to perfect the app. However, I am happy that a significant amount of development funding is built in through fees as the app is rolled out and used.\u201d ", "birthday": "2016-11-15T16:30:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-15 16:30:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 15}

Its mining-based network and decentralized nature enables firms to store and transfer monetary data instantaneously with low fees.\nThe mechanism of utilizing a shared network amongst both administrators and users allows the settlement of money in real time, allowing banks to process cross-border payments in a more cost-efficient and secure manner.\nHowever, the HKMA states that the anonymous and decentralized characteristics of the Blockchain technology may lead banks into conflicts with financial regulations and KYC policies, particularly if banks are not able to manipulate and control the transactions.\nIssues with decentralized Blockchains\nBanks and financial institutions have been struggling to find a way to implement the Blockchain technology, primarily due to various financial regulations.\nBy default, banks are not permitted to integrate decentralized networks, as law enforcement and authorities would not be able to control the network and its settlements. Thus, the only method of integrating the Blockchain technology is by creating a permissioned ledger, or a controllable ledger, that is centralized and grants a certain level of control to network administrators.\nWhile the idea of creating a centralized Blockchain network seems simple in theory, mathematically and systematically, it will pose an enormous security threat to the bank\u2019s IT infrastructure.\nThus, the question comes down to:\nDo banks continue their attempt to integrate a permissioned Blockchain network?

Some observers argued that existing Russian laws would be sufficient to deal with criminal activity without establishing a separate rule based solely on the use of cryptocurrencies. \u00a0\nSecondly, Russia is now exploring the potential advantages of the relevant technologies behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Consequently, some Russian authorities are working on new legal reforms to provide a legitimate basis for the use and development of cryptocurrencies. \u00a0\nProponents include Herman Gref, the chairman of Russian banking giant Sberbank and a former Minister of Economics and Trade, Mr. Gref, has argued that if Russia bans cryptocurrencies, it will risk falling behind in innovations related to Blockchain and similar technologies. Other Russian officials have also expressed interest in Blockchain and further progress is expected on this front in 2017.\nMasterchain\nA concrete example of Russian interest in Blockchain technologies is Masterchain. Commencing in Fall 2015, the Russian Central Bank established a working group to study Blockchain technologies and explore potential practical applications with emphasis on financial markets. \u00a0\nThis led to efforts to establish a prototype distributed database for financial messaging.\nIn 2016, a consortium including Russian payments company Qiwi, Accenture and four Russian financial organizations began testing Blockchain technologies in cooperation with the Central Bank. \u00a0\nThe work of the consortium resulted in Masterchain, an Ethereum-based Blockchain prototype for the validation and exchange of client data and transactional information. \u00a0\nIn contrast to Ethereum, Masterchain is a permissioned and private database of chained blocks of data. The Central Bank of Russia acts simultaneously as an ordinary user in payment processing and a trusted administrator.\nFurther prototypes\nThe next step may be to develop further prototypes. Central Bank officials are currently examining two other proposed versions of Masterchain. One is Ethereum-based and uses a proof of work (POW) consensus algorithm (to be replaced with a proof of stake (POS) algorithm when Ethereum switches to POS).\nThe second already uses the POS algorithm. A group of 10 Russian financial organizations will test these products, with the goal of eventual commercial use.\nAnother Russian proposal is to establish a professional association called \"FinTech\", which would assist in drafting legal reforms to regulate Blockchain technologies. Representatives of various governmental agencies would then participate. \u00a0\nThe new body would address various applications of Blockchain technologies such as electronic voting, notary systems, maintenance of shareholder, real estate and other statutory registers and validation of client data and transactional information.\nOther Russian organizations and business leaders are also becoming active. The National Settlement Depository, Russia\u2019s central securities depository, has initiated a pilot e-proxy shareholder voting project using a permissioned Blockchain solution.\nIn addition, the Perm State National Research University has opened a laboratory to study \u201ccrypto-economics\u201d and Blockchain systems. A prominent Russian entrepreneur has also invested in the BlockGeeks social media platform and Russian payments company Qiwi plans to upgrade its core database to a distributed ledger system within five years.\nSmart Contracts\nThe use of Blockchain technologies for the formation and implementation of \u201csmart contracts\u201d has also attracted interest in Russia, but may require further legal reforms. \u00a0\nRussia has already begun incorporating applications for modern technologies into its civil laws and contract practices.\nFor example, Russian law allows parties to enter into contracts by the exchange of electronic documents through e-mail or other means.\nHowever, in some cases it may be advisable to create a separate physical document to establish the legal basis for subsequent electronic communications. \u00a0\nThe use of various types of electronic signatures is also authorized under rules like the 1999 EU Electronic Signatures Directive. However, certain verification keys may require certification by the Russian communications authorities.\nIn addition, a number of Russian governmental bodies have modernized their operations to facilitate the exchange of documents via online platforms such as electronic submission of tax declarations, accounting reports and license and patent applications.\nThese include the Federal Tax Service, the Federal Service for Intellectual Property and the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media. \u00a0Notary filings may be submitted electronically and the state companies register is accessible online.\nNonetheless, in some respects Russia remains a tradition-bound market in which physical documents, seals and stamps are essential. \u00a0In particular, the transition to distributed ledger systems and virtual contracts will conflict with existing centralized registers that are legally required for certain transactions. \u00a0\nAn example is the sale of \u201cparticipation interests\u201d in a Russian limited liability company (LLC) which is enforced by notarial certification of the written sale contract and recording of the corresponding entry into the state register.\nFor sales of shares in stock companies, the transfer must be recorded in a separate register, typically kept by an independent service provider.\nQuestions remain", "birthday": "2016-11-17T17:06:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-17 17:06:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 17}

Ltd. Our findings are based on both code and network analysis of the firmware. The user and device information was collected automatically and transmitted periodically without the user's consent or knowledge. The collected information was encrypted with multiple layers of encryption and then transmitted over secure web protocols to a server located in Shanghai. This software and behavior bypasses the detection of mobile anti-virus tools because they assume that software that ships with the device is not malware and thus, it is white-listed. In September 2016, Adups claimed on its website to have a worldwide presence with over 700 million active users, and a market share exceeding 70% across over 150 countries and regions with offices in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing, Tokyo, New Delhi, and Miami. The Adups web site also stated that it produces firmware that is integrated in more than 400 leading mobile operators, semiconductor vendors, and device manufacturers spanning from wearable and mobile devices to cars and televisions.\u201d \nWhile this may sound out of the ordinary, these claims highlight the risks posed by the identified firmware, of which could enhance the unauthorised access to Bitcoin private keys - if you use your wallet on these phones - which translates to the theft of your Bitcoin.\nBitpayCEO Stephen Pair said this could possibly happen without the phone user's knowledge, though he didn\u2019t state whether it could be linked to certain hackers - either state sponsored - or any entity.\nHe says to Cointelegraph via email:", "birthday": "2016-11-18T15:30:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-18 15:30:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 18}

Tech enthusiasts and bright business minds do not wait for the Blockchain revolution to happen, they make it happen.\nThe first Russian Bitcoin Conference, which was held in the Spring of this year, has demonstrated not only that there is a strong demand for the developing of technology in the country, but also the need to create a platform for sharing experiences and knowledge.\nTwo main areas of concern\nThe very recent Blockchain&Bitcoin Conference was organized by Smile Expo in the conference center, Digital October. The event was naturally divided into two interesting and important tracks - \u00a0a Technology Track \u00a0led by the founder of Bits.media Ivan Tikhonov, and a Regulations Track, led by Blockchain entrepreneur Alex Fork.\nKey speakers within the Financial Track - Elina Sidorenko, who is heading the working group for digital currencies at the State Duma, and Artem Tolkachev, the head of the Blockchain Community - outlined the position of Russian authorities regarding the development of digital currencies in the country. As was suggested by the speakers, the main issues discussed by the regulators at the moment concern defining the legal status of digital currencies and ways of their regulation.\n\n-\u00a0Artem Tolkachev\nFollowing the experiences of other countries, state authorities suggest the treating of digital currencies as one of the following: finances, financial tool, quasi-money, or goods. Each of these options has its own pros and cons and requires the introduction of changes within national legislation.\nFor example, the idea of digital money being considered as a financial tool is too obscure and uncertain, as the variety of financial tools are too wide and any changes have to be considered by the federal law payment system. Treating digital money as goods is not easy either, it would equalize all digital money transactions to trade turnover, leading to certain complications in the tax policies and trade regulations. Unsurprisingly the term quasi-money appeared in discussions over the nature of digital currencies.\nElina Sidorenko explained: \u201cThe term quasi-money does not necessarily imply something bad. This term could eventually be used to define any digital currency, as soon as we agree on what we actually mean by that.\u201d\nIndustry has changed significantly\nGenerally the situation around digital currencies in Russia has changed significantly during the last seven months. The most discussed topic last Spring was how harsh the penalty would follow for trading digital currencies. Luckily, regulators have moved forward from their desire to ban alternative money and prevent them from any possible development.\n\n- Ivan Tikhomirov\nThe working group, analyzing risks from transactions with digital money, will be presenting their report later in December along with suggestions for ministries and other state bodies concerned with the issue. It is expected that soon after the report is handed down, regulators would take concrete steps for introducing changes into the current legislation, or the development of a regulatory framework dealing specifically with digital currencies.\nThere is a chance that Russia can become one of the few countries actively developing regulatory framework. The pioneer in this field is certainly Japan, where digital currencies are already treated as foreign currencies, and regulatory methods are being developed and tested.\nWhat is cryptocurrency and how to deal with it\nArtem Tolkachev largely agrees that the issue of regulation of cryptocurrencies is one of the most pressing issues at the moment. He said that there are at least two directions that could be followed in this regard. First of all, information as such can become a subject of transactions, while digital currencies could be referred to as a special kind of property, characterized by value, circulability and recognition by a wide community.\nSecondly, treating digital currencies as foreign currencies could be a way out, in case a special regime of taxation is introduced simultaneously.", "birthday": "2016-11-19T12:53:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-19 12:53:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 19}

It fixes transaction malleability, increases capacity of blocks, enables Lightning and enhances security measures of hardware wallets.\nIn an interview, Ledger CTO Nicolas Bacca similarly emphasized the positive impact SegWit will have on hardware wallets, noting that SegWit allows users to cryptographically sign input amounts of transaction, which solves one of the major issues with hardware wallets.\nRationale and motive of mining pools blocking SegWit activation\nViaBTC, a Bitcoin mining pool that holds just over eight percent in hashpower, has stated that the organization will do anything in its capability to block the activation of SegWit. Specifically, ViaBTC suggested that SegWit is a proposal submitted to stall blocksize increase, which Mow disagrees with completely.\nMow believes that by dismissing the technical benefits of SegWit and the effect it could have on the Bitcoin network and recklessly advocating for bigger blocks without necessary preparation and technological research, ViaBTC and other organizations attempting to block SegWit activation are encouraging politics in Bitcoin.\nIn a technical sense, SegWit is not a proposal designed to stall blocksize increase but to expand the capacity of the blocksize. As Mow explains, SegWit will lead to bigger blocks - 1.7 MB - which will allow the Bitcoin network to handle more transactions and avoid full blocks\n\u201cThey can\u2019t possibly want to scale Bitcoin, because SegWit will give them bigger blocks (1.7 MB) and on-chain scaling. They\u2019re specifically asking for lines of code to be changed in inefficient ways when they don't even understand the protocol or tradeoffs. That\u2019s just crazy,\u201d Mow told Cointelegraph.\nWill SegWit become activated?\nDespite the efforts of some mining pools and individuals to stop SegWit activation, Mow hopes miners will come to realize SegWit\u2019s benefits and make unbiased and fully informative decisions.\nWhen it comes to important protocol changes, it is crucial to view the matter objectively and evaluate actual advantages a change could bring. While it is understandable to think that ViaBTC and other mining pools are opting for larger blocks, with or without increasing blocksize, SegWit will serve as a vital on-chain scaling solution.\n\u201cI hope others are aware of SegWit\u2019s benefits and they make their own informed decisions. I think SegWit should be activated, along with many others in the community, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing if we wait until there is clear consensus,\u201d said Mow.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nRest of the Interview:", "birthday": "2016-11-19T11:50:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-19 11:50:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 19}

Almost everywhere you turn, there is a certain coin to mine, a product to invest in, or a cryptocurrency based MLM that promises extraordinary payouts. The number of individuals who subscribe to these programs, on a daily basis, rises exponentially.\nBefore this current wave of events, there have been similar cases where money making programs, that looked too good to be true, appeared and sucked people in, only to suddenly collapsed. Victims of such scams have always been left in pains and regrets, for those who lived through the disappointments.\nWhy do scams persist?\nOne question that remains to be answered is the reason why the public keeps falling for this agelong trick, despite their own previous painful experiences or those experienced by others within the space. Another major issue that persists is how to identify such schemes, for what they truly represent, in the early stages, especially as it relates to cryptocurrencies.\nAccording to Bob Wood, the founder and CEO of Nexxus Partners, scams of all kinds feed on two ingredients to create their perfect storm:\u00a0ignorance and greed. Wood explains that new technologies are not understood by most people, enabling scammers to twist the facts just enough to include some truth mixed with deception, so as to occasionally fool individuals.\nWood says:\n \u201cIf any guilt is to be found with most people, it is not for perpetuating a scam, but for not fully vetting the claims.\u201d \nWood points out that scams are often propagated within social circles based on trusted relationships, often in churches, work associates and other social groups. In such cases, he notes that the people often look to the reputation of the presenter, trusting that they would never try to cheat them, instead of asking what has been done to fully prove or disprove the opportunity claims.\nThe categories of cryptocurrency scam\nWood categorizes cryptocurrency scams into two groups:\n1. Opportunities pretending to be cryptocurrency\nAccording to Wood, the fundamental principles of cryptocurrency includes decentralization, privacy, unlimited use, controlled supply, and transparency with a public ledger, called a Blockchain, and publicly disclosed source code for anyone to verify. Any entity that does not satisfy these requirements cannot pass for a genuine cryptocurrency.\nThe biggest culprit in this category, as noted by Wood, is Onecoin.\n\u201cOneCoin is an illegal Ponzi scheme, promising unrealistic returns on investment that only come from new investor\u2019s money,\u201d he says.\n2.

Interchange fee schedules are set by the network that carries a transaction such as Visa, MasterCard, or one of the PIN debit networks.\nPrior to the Federal Reserve Board issued Reg II in June 2011 to implement the Durbin Amendment, the interchange fees were set at $0.48. Afterwards, the Board notes:\n \u201cUnder the regulation, on Oct. 1, 2011, interchange fees for issuers with assets greater than $10 bln were capped at 21 cents plus 0.05 percent of the transaction value.

The beginning of a medium-term trend is therefore likely to grow under these conditions.\nETH/USD\nAs was predicted last week, the large amount of buy stop orders has prevented the price from falling even lower. Instead, Ether\u2019s price is steadily forming a sub-wave of the downward trend. At the moment, ETH has again reached the bottom limit of its long-term flat. There is a pretty large volume near $10. The sentiment of the majority of the bulls hasn\u2019t changed from the beginning of previous week, and they still expect at least a new wave of the flat, headed towards $14.\n\nHowever, a big seller can still provoke decent volatility by making the bulls sell everything they have bought near $10. If the price fortifies near $9.5 and forms a downward turning wave, the price of Ether could go as low as $7. Large sellers have to get the price at least down to that mark in order to make profit. Such an increase in volatility can likely influence the bulls and in that case, they will start selling en masse, which will ultimately lead to a new price surge. That will happen because of the large sellers absorbing their profit. This is the most likely scenario, given the current situation with the buy stop orders.\nIn regards to the opposite scenario, in order to form a new upward wave of the sideway movement, Ether\u2019s price has to break through very serious resistance near $11.5. The key level has moved to that zone over the past week. It is also a crossing area for the Fibonacci 61 percent retracement, the diagonal channel and the peak of the rebound of the last sub-wave of the downward movement. The importance of that mark is confirmed by the large volume of sell stop orders. The majority of the bears expect a continuation of the downward trend to follow the upward rebound and it seems that this level of correction is acceptable for many traders. That is why the price of Ether is most likely to stop there in case of growth.

Enough has been written about the \u201cend of cash\u201d and how there will be a day when we will all be using digital money. Well that future has arrived for the one billion plus people of India.\nEver since the demonetization of the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 banknotes on the midnight of Oct. 9, 2016, life has turned into a ghastly nightmare for billions of teeming masses. Things that we took for granted have become a challenge, not unequal to climbing the highest of Himalayan peaks. Welcome to cashless chaos, the story of a demonetized India.\nCash starved people are dying\nThe government\u2019s ambitious plan of getting rid of black money involved monetizing 86 percent of the currency that was in circulation.\nThey gave the people four hours of notice and at the stroke of midnight on Oct. 9, all the rupee notes in the wallets became mere pieces of paper. The remaining denominations of Rs. 100 and below continued to legal tender.\nNow that the banks have reopened, people are finding out that ATMs simply do not work and there is no cash at the tellers either. Many people, especially those that have no access to banks, live in remote parts of the country or are simply too poor and uneducated, are struggling.\nIndia Today reports:\n \u201cHuge crowds gathered outside Canara Bank in Delhi's Yamuna Vihar. People continue to face difficulties in paying for household items, essential commodities and vegetables. Serpentine queues were witnessed at banks across India on Thursday as people thronged to exchange their old currency. Some of the banks ran out of cash.\u201d \nIn the meantime, at least three people have been reported dead.\nHuffington Posts Writes: \u201cThree Indians, including one person in Mumbai city and two others in the southern state of Kerala, have died waiting in long queues outside banks, after the Indian government unveiled a surprise policy decision to curb black money.\u201d\nWeddings disrupted, hospitals refusing patients\nThe announcement of demonetization has caught a lot of people in the lurch. Winter is traditionally the time for weddings in India and the wedding season has just started. Many people are finding it hard to deal with restrictions on cash withdrawals, especially when they have to pay caterers, florists and other tradesmen who only accept cash. The daily limit on ATMs has been pegged at Rs. 2000, which is roughly $30 and the weekly withdrawal limit on cash at the teller is Rs. 20,000, which is roughly $300.\nThe more pressing crisis though is the refusal of privately owned hospitals to accept the scrapped cash.\nThe government run hospitals have been instructed to accept this money for now but these hospitals are mostly understaffed, unsanitary and often have deplorable conditions. The Hindustan Times reports: \u00a0\n \u201cA spokesperson for Chennai-based Apollo Hospitals said they were not accepting the larger notes. Apollo has 65 hospitals across the country.\u201d \nA pointless, expensive exercise\nDemonetization has turned into an ugly nightmare from which there is no escape. All the reasons that the government has cited for carrying out this exercise ring hollow.\nWhile they said that this move would get rid of black money, there have been several reports of people having bought gold at premium prices from jewellers across India, just to get rid of their ill-gotten wealth.\nThe government also said that this move was carried out to thwart counterfeiters, but the Hindu newspaper\u00a0has broken news that there are no new security features in the newly issued banknotes either. They cite a senior government official as saying: \u201cSince the decision to introduce the new notes was taken only six months ago, there was no time to alter the security features.

Donald Trump could have ran for president at any time over the last 30 years, but the political process and its underbelly were surely one of the factors that deterred him from becoming the most powerful person in the world.\nThere are many factors that make becoming a major American politician unattractive for a private businessman, but the election process may be chief among them. When one considers the months spent traveling to new cities and states multiple times a day, the hotel rooms, the jet lag, the local politicians you need to wine and dine and the infrastructure that needs to be built to gain local voters, you begin to understand that there is a lot that goes into winning an election.\nEven assuming you get everything right, you could still lose an election to voter fraud. Just look at the 2000 presidential election.\u00a0This article in the New York Times, sixteen years ago, goes over all the problems, both illegal in nature and mismanaged, that caused a controversial win for President Bush in the swing state of Florida. I was living and voting in Florida at the time, and bags of votes were seen taken from the voting precincts to be discarded or not counted.\nThis one state decided the 2000 presidential election, and \u201cswing states\u201d are where shady voting tactics taken place in major elections. Fraud is concentrated in states where they can \u201cswing\u201d an election, with more stable states not prone to such issues and irregularities. There are no coincidences in politics.\nPresident Trump knows the truth, as do I\nIn the most recent presidential election, either voting laws were broken or massive fraud was recorded throughout the nation. In Philadelphia, this involved the physical intimidation of Trump poll-watchers, and\u00a0people being told to vote for Hillary Clinton by pollsters on election day. People would click Trump on the ballot and\u00a0the vote would only register for Clinton. Even\u00a0dead people have been known to vote, multiple times!\n Philly:#Trump pollwatcher threatened with a belt. Has left polling place. Feared attack was imminent. Wissinomming Rec. \u2014 Mike Roman (@mikeroman) November 8, 2016\n\nDon\u2019t you wonder why Hillary Clinton did not ask for a recount of this fairly close election? Most probably because 10-20 mln skeletons would\u2019ve come flying out of that closet, once you take out multiple votes by individuals,\u00a0voter irregularities, dead people voting, etc.\nPresident Trump said months ago that the voting system was rigged, and the facts support him after the election, but he still won anyway. In reality, he probably outscored Clinton by several million votes, but the aforementioned issues, which inflated Clinton\u2019s vote totals, made it seem closer than it really was. The final tally of all the votes shows Clinton outvoting Trump, however, do you really believe that was the case? President Trump knows the truth, as do I, but in the end, it doesn\u2019t even matter.\nRegarding illegal immigrants and aliens voting, this was even more rampant, and in many ways legitimized by Clinton supporters.\u00a0A dozen U.S. states allow illegal immigrants to vote in federal elections by way of allowing them to obtain driver\u2019s licenses. Once you have a license, you can vote in your local elections. One of these states just so happens to be California, where Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 2.5 mln ballots. Even\u00a0President Obama encouraged illegal immigrants to vote, implying that just making a vote makes them a U.S. citizen!\nDid you know that in 25 percent of the country you can get a driver\u2019s license and vote without even being a citizen? I didn\u2019t, and I wonder if you went over to France or Germany, on vacation, could you get a driver\u2019s license in two weeks and vote in the national election by the end of the month? What do you think? Does it sound possible? You know what they say, only in America.\nWill the national voting system ever be perfect? No. Election fraud can only take you so far in a system so vast, consisting of so many counties and with people returning to vote after years away from the process. Yet one key state, like Florida in 2000, having issues with fraud can change the outcome of an election.", "birthday": "2016-11-14T12:35:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-14 12:35:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 14}

While we are relatively neutral on the market for the time being, our long term bias remains bullish.\nFollowing what ended up being a surprise Trump win in the U.S. elections last week, the price of Bitcoin continued its upward move that night, however, has been on a downward trajectory ever since. From a fundamental perspective, we believe much of this slide has to do with \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d traders taking profits from the past few weeks.\nThe rest is likely due to what some may perceive as a more responsible, and therefore, hawkish Fed - hence why gold and silver got slaughtered late last week.

Now we sit in a consolidation range between $670\u2013750, a critical area that could help determine where Bitcoin is headed over the next week or two.\nWe can see on the three-day chart below, that what initially looked like an ominous double top could also be viewed as a progressing Cup & Handle (C&H) formation given the bullish context of the market right now. A C&H is typically a continuation pattern in which the \u201chandle\u201d part retraces about 1/3 of the \u201ccup\u2019s\u201d move prior to breaking out to higher levels. This indicates relatively minor downside from here, perhaps to test the upper trendline in the $650 region, but also implies this short-lived move lower will be a buying opportunity.

It took me over 40 years to figure out that I am good for only six hours of sleep a night, not the recommended eight. I was going to get up now anyway, but the new stream of consciousness for my feelings on the future of this planet awakens me this morning. Am I doing all that I can to change what may prove to be fait accompli? Have I done enough to sooth my soul, when it\u2019s all said and done? Did I take enough of a stand? Is voting alone enough? This time, no, it is not. The situation is that serious.\nThis article will take hours to write, but it matter not. I am obligated by divine purpose to send this message. If one person hears it and is profoundly affected, I have done my job. This is all that matters to me. Bringing a year\u2019s worth of spin, bluster, promises and deception into one almost-but-not-really-digestible capsule for the Bitcoin community\u2019s consumption. So let us begin.\nHillary Rodham Clinton is clearly, easily, the most corrupt and criminal candidate to ever run for the Presidency of the United States of America, and I will delve into a good chunk of her corrupt activities here, of which will take some time. If she were a little more ethical, and less devious, she would be barred from running for any public office ever again, under a legitimate political system. The felonies she has committed, both known and unknown, would imprison you or I for many years, if not our entire lives.\nYet, when you are a protected member of the political elite, when your own level of corruption, over the last thirty years, has bought you friends in the highest of places, you live above the law.\nThis article seeks to explain just how far above the law the Secretary of State went, and what comes next if she is allowed even more rope to strangle what freedom is left in \u201cthe land of the free.\u201d\nThere is so much information available on the times and crimes of Hillary Clinton. If you do not know just how deep this rabbit hole of deception goes, it speaks to your apathy, if not your ignorance. In \u201cthe information age,\u201d what we have learned over the last generation, without a shadow of a doubt, is that the Internet will reveal all of the skeletons you hide in your closet. We\u2019re all online, exposing ourselves, while sharing and exposing others. You can hide who you truly are for only so long.\nHillary Clinton has been exposed throughout her failed attempts at serving the public as a New York Senator, her failed 2008 presidential bid against an African-American man nobody had ever heard of, and her extensive list of failures as Secretary of State, where the U.S. is in greater peril now than ever before. The Podesta emails, and other new sources, are airing her dirty laundry even more extensively throughout this 2016 presidential campaign. There are no more shadows for her crimes to hide now.\nBefore I state my case, it is important to understand the obligation to vote in a free society, at a minimum, and the value of voting. George Carlin famously said in his stand-up comedy act that \"Those who vote lose the right to complain.\u201d In reality, it is quite the opposite. If you fail to take a side, if you fail to care enough to get involved in the process, if you fail to come up with a better way, if you fail to get off your ass and do something about what happens next, then you are just the loudmouth who complains, but has forfeited your right to, due to your many failures along the way.\nIt\u2019s far too easy, and really downright cowardly, to abstain or avoid voting. You can lie to yourself, and say that this is the \u201cmoral high ground.\u201d That your voting makes you a part of, and complicit in, the flawed political system. The American two-party system is as corrupt, deceptive, and laughable as the \u201cheels\u201d and \u201cfaces\u201d who provide you dinner theatre on Monday nights for World Wrestling Entertainment. At 10 p.m. they are at each other\u2019s throats, but by midnight, they are giving each other \u201cdap,\u201c jumping into their rental cars together, and taking their carnival to the next town for the next \u201ccard.\u201d\nDemocrats and Republicans in the United States are no better, and are much worse. Pro wrestlers are not obligated to serve the public, or the greater good, by taking public offices of governance. They do not ask millions of dollars in donations from their constituents to perpetuate their lies and deception, only to double-cross their investors and voters in the years to come. Wrestlers are just here to entertain you, - \u201cAre you not entertained?\u201d said General Maximus Decimus Meridius in the film Gladiator - while politicians are purchased to deceive you, with a few exceptions.\nThe point of this is if you do not vote, you are either too apathetic, too cynical, or literally too ignorant to care about what happens next, so you forfeit your right to complain and \u201cRage against the Machine.\u201d I used to think abstaining was the highest ground, but this is a false narrative to soothe our beaten soul. It is just what we tell ourselves when we don\u2019t know what else to do, and it really is a sheep mentality. When it is the lesser of two evils, the right thing to do is to be smart enough to vote for the lesser evil, and then fight against societal slippage. Your responsibility is to believe in something, and take action.\nUntil the \u201cInvisible Government\u201d Teddy Roosevelt and other former U.S. Presidents have spoken about in the last century are removed, and until you have a better way forward, this is the most moral play in the playbook. Otherwise, you are just conning yourself, and leaving the future open to total destruction through your apathy. If you didn\u2019t care enough about the future to vote, then you can\u2019t care enough to complain. Either care, or don\u2019t. You can\u2019t have it both ways. You may not want to vote for either, but if you don\u2019t, decisions this important will be made for you. Hopefully, you are smart enough to know that. There will be a president. So choose that president on Tuesday.\nNow onto the \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\nThe United States is the most powerful empire in the history of the world. It\u2019s military can destroy the entire planet within seconds, and its breadth spreads to bases in virtually every country on Earth. Its culture, technological sophistication and economic strength influence the rest of the world\u2019s desires, icons, and capabilities.\nThe online and mainstream media influence of American-based companies has literally changed the world since the end of the Second World War. Yes, what happens in this election will have huge ramifications as to what happens next, both online and offline.\nLet\u2019s start with war, World War III that is. It has been the United State\u2019s mainstream media and political establishment\u2019s desire over the last year to blame Russia for everything and anything, to justify a future war of attrition. From economic sanctions against Russia over the last three years, to NATO moving right to Russia\u2019s border in Ukraine, trying to make Russia flinch, the Military Industrial Complex is primed for WW3. Russia has said they have no interest in war, and they are actively fighting terrorism in Syria and Aleppo, which has only served to antagonize the warmongers even more.\nHillary Clinton has accused Russia of hacking the DNC and anything else she can think of to explain her criminality being exposed more than ever before. If she loses this election, she wants to have the outlet of blaming Russia\u2019s hackers, not justice or the will of the people, that defeated her. She has provided no proof of this, and neither has any part of the mainstream media or the political establishment, but so what? She has even gone so far as to directly threaten Russia with war for this alleged, and most likely \u201cnon-existent\u201d cyber attack. This video, from September, covers all of the above:\n    \nSo she is openly courting WW3 with Russia for something she cannot prove happened, and probably never did happen. Donald Trump, on the other hand, has openly stated, in the recent televised debates, that he can work with Putin and build some form of cordial relationship, thus avoiding WW3.\nHe is a master negotiator, and sees no reason to start a war, and has seen no proof of Russian wrongdoing. This logical approach has only forced Clinton and her establishment minions to accuse Donald of being some sort of Russian spy, in an effort to discredit him. Draw your own conclusions, ladies and gentlemen.\nSo if you wouldn\u2019t mind WW3 jumping off in the next year or two, please, vote for Hillary Clinton, or abstain from voting.\nIf you do not vote, and you allow her to get in, you lose your right to complain about nuclear winter.\nBreaking news on the depths of Clinton\u2019s criminality out of New York\nThursday it was revealed, on alternative media, not the bought-and-paid-for mainstream media, that Hillary Clinton, and her accomplice Huma Abedin, have skeletons in their closet that should put her into a prison cell for the rest of her natural years.\nThe New York Police Department (NYPD) has revealed that a laptop owned and shared by Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin was discovered with at least 500,000 emails, some say 650,000 emails, that were sent to, from, or about Hillary Clinton. This was all during the time when she was Secretary of State, and these emails are what drove the FBI to re-open their criminal investigation against her.\nThe content, from sources within the NYPD, spans a wide swath of felonious criminal behavior. Her pay-to-play corruption as Secretary of State, for example, her getting a $1 million \u201cgift\u201d from Saudi Arabia through her false front Clinton Foundation. This corruption example actually comes from the Podesta Emails revealed by Wikileaks, which accepts Bitcoin donations.\nThe NYPD cites far worse than just garden-variety corruption and a consistent lack of ethics suitable for public office. Let\u2019s start at the top, with emails speaking about:\n Money laundering Child exploitation Sex crimes with minors (children) Perjury Pay to play through Clinton Foundation Obstruction of justice Other felony crimes \n    \nLet\u2019s look at one aspect of her not-so-well-known criminal behavior, child molestation. An NYPD Chief associated with the email recovery stated on Thursday:\n \u201cWhat\u2019s in the emails is staggering and, as a father, it turned my stomach. There is not going to be any Houdini-like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference, if it comes to that. People are going to prison.\u201d \nHe could not say Clinton going to prison, but you should be able to read in between these lines, right? He\u2019s not exactly hiding the truth from you, like Clinton has done for decades.\nThe new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, former President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials, accompanied by convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein billionaire, on his Boeing 727 on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. Epstein\u2019s island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries.\nBoth NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epstein\u2019s guest on at least six occasions, probably more when all the evidence is combed, sources said.\nBill Clinton, it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years, that he too traveled with Epstein over 20 times to the island.\nClinton and Abedin both also sent copious amounts of classified and \u201ctop secret\u201d emails from personal email accounts, a direct legal violation of her position as Secretary of State, and a felony.\nI could go on, but you get the point. Clinton\u2019s skeletons have skeletons. Her closet is darker than you can imagine, and is not a walk-in closet. This closet has an island on it!\nWhat about the Internet and Bitcoin?\nOk, so she\u2019s corrupt, is probably complicit, if not actively involved in crimes against children, and she\u2019ll probably go to prison after the election, win or lose. So what does that have to do with us? We care about the future of the Internet and trading Bitcoin, not if America is screwed indefinitely. Well, let us look at the progression of events when it comes to globalists like President Obama and Hillary Clinton and the state of the Internet now and in the future.\nTo America\u2019s credit, the Internet, in its present and public form, would not be here today without the development and investment of the United States, as well as Great Britain. The Internet has changed the world forever, with the exposure of the truth about Hillary Clinton, as just another example of how important it has become as a truth serum to the world.\nOver the last 27 years, the Internet has been safeguarded, in effect, by ICANN and its progenitors, and has allowed it to operate in a largely decentralized, free, and unregulated fashion. Generally, the regulations are limited to those of your local jurisdiction and how oppressive, or liberal, they choose to be with it. Those days have come to an end under President Barack Obama, as the United Nations took control of the Internet earlier this year.\nOn the surface, the U.N.\u2019s take over seems to be a non-issue. Now, every nation within their membership can have some influence on the future of the Internet, in theory. Is this a good thing, or a \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it?\u201d China has been a known enemy of a free internet, and is gaining major economic and political influence worldwide. Going forward, this may be following steps along the path of centralization, regulation, and censorship of the Internet. Which President do you think would endorse that Internet future?\nHillary Clinton\u2019s corruption, lies, and criminal behavior have been brought to light via the Internet for years. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has used the Internet to gain Twitter followers, spread his message, and attract tens of thousands to his rallies around the United States. It has also made it much more likely for him to reach his final goal as POTUS, with the damage the information it provides has done to Hillary Clinton\u2019s image through Wikileaks, the NYPD, etc.\nDo you think Donald Trump will allow the censorship of the Internet when it clearly is helping him become the leader of the free world?\nDo you think Hillary Clinton will use the position of President of the United States to accelerate the shutdown of the Internet? She certainly should have an axe to grind against it, as it has shown you the emperor has no clothes. Let\u2019s say she actually wins the election, but is indicted for her crimes and removed from office in first quarter of 2017. Do you think \u201cyes-man\u201d Tim Kaine is going to stand up for the Internet, if he will not stand up against Clinton\u2019s unethical and criminal past? Has he shown any ability to lead a nation, or protect the global Internet? He can\u2019t even get more than 30 people to meet him at a Florida gymnasium to have a rally!\nTo be fair, Mike Pence is no better, except at the people showing up to his meetings part. He does not agree with Trump on key issues. He was in favour of the Iraq war, while Trump was alone against it. He was also a known proponent of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP,) which Trump also opposes. Anyone who supports the TPP, firstly, have not studied it, with members of Congress and State not being allowed to download or copy it for review. Secondly, has been conned into thinking it is a \u201cfair trade deal\u201d for the United States when it is clearly not, given the fact that it is being hidden from the public and all interested parties. Or thirdly, you know what\u2019s up and are complicit in its true mission, to undermine the U.S.\u2019s sovereignty, over-regulate things like the Internet, and remove regulations that keep fascist corporations in check, like food labeling or the profits reaped from environmentally destructive activities for profit.\nIf you have ever watched a \u201cBlade\u201d movie, starring Wesley Snipes, Mike Pence strikes me as a \u201cfamiliar.\u201d A \u201cfamiliar\u201d is not a vampire - like some see Hillary Clinton as - but as a wannabe vampire. Given his proven interests in starting unjust wars and approving sweeping regulations he probably doesn\u2019t understand, he would be easily \u201cturned\u201d away from Trump\u2019s ideals to other interests, if something were to befall Donald while in office.\nI do not trust Pence and he is a poor choice for vice president by Trump. He may have felt that he needed someone that was less hardcore populist, and more establishment-friendly, as a running mate, but he could have done much better. I hope this never becomes a factor in the future, or else he may become the next Lyndon B. Johnson. Let America not repeat that history, from that afternoon in Dallas, forward throughout the war-torn 1960\u2019s. Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\nMy point is the Internet is on the shakiest ground it has ever been. \u201cGlobalism\u201d is code for taking sovereignty and freedom away from nations - see the \u201cMuslim Migration\u201d in the E.U. as Exhibit A.\u00a0These things are not happenstance. Nothing on this scale, the changing hands of the Internet, the Muslim Migration, the brinksmanship in the Ukraine and the South China Sea, and the hidden agenda of the TTP and the TTIP. This is all by design for a future globalist takeover, leading to global governance and a global currency.\nIf the Internet\u2019s future is in play, so is Bitcoin\u2019s, which is 99 percent Internet-based - save for paper wallets. Trump has fought against the TPP since day one, and the Internet\u2019s ultimate control is definitely one of the main entrees on the menu of this regulatory truck stop diner. If the TPP gets rammed through, in one form or another, the Internet as you know it, and Bitcoin, is over.\nOh, did I mention that Hillary Clinton has approved and promoted the Trans Pacific Partnership as \u201cthe gold standard\u201d of trade deals at least 45 times over the last two years?\n    \nIf Clinton gets into office for four years, she will find a way to slip TPP through eventually, either by changing its name, or waiting until Washington is on \u201choliday recess\u201d - see Federal Reserve Act of 1913 - or by \u201cexecutive order.\"\nI haven\u2019t even delved into the whole election fraud issue! The illegals being shuttled into this country to vote with no ID required (I wonder why? Probably to vote for Trump, right?) and even the deceased, or the \u201cundead,\u201d being recruited to vote for Clinton over, and over again. Do you think someone who is getting 500-1000 people to her events is really going to beat someone who regularly gets 10-15 times that amount to hear him speak in a popular election vote? In early voting already, people are reporting that the machines are not registering votes properly, and paper ballots are not being made available when they are requested.\nThis is unethical and a violation of voting rules and regulations. Trump has said, for months, that the entire system, from the mainstream media\u2019s election coverage to the voting mechanisms, are rigged, and he might be right. If so, what can we do about it?\nThere are examples on major national news sites that the totals for the election have already been entered, like you would an excel spreadsheet, and that Hillary is going to win by a landslide, at least in the Electoral College. Some say that if Trump does win the popular vote by 5-10 percent, the results can be altered to prevent him from winning fair and square, and Clinton will be anointed president, surreptitiously. It should be clear that Clinton really won\u2019t get more voters on her side than Trump, or else poll samples would be leaning more towards Democrats than Republicans. The mainstream media has gone all-in for Hillary Clinton, and have lost all credibility, win or lose. They know what I know.\nI am not in the U.S. at this time, but I spent $45 to send in my official mail-in ballot for Donald J. Trump. I downloaded, emailed, called the County Clerk, three times, bought envelopes, and tracked my vote for the best possible future for a country I don\u2019t even live in! I hope you do the same, as you would only have to do 1/10 of what I did, and you could protect your nation\u2019s future, free of charge. You can\u2019t sit on the sidelines. Not this time. America\u2019s, and the World\u2019s, future depends on what happens on Tuesday.\nI wish I could do more, and maybe this article changes the mind of one person on Tuesday, or gets one Hillary Clinton supporter to stay home. I am doing this out of love for my homeland. ALL of my family resides in the U.S. of A. and I would like to be able to return there freely, and not enter a full-on police state when I do. Things have gotten bad enough, but they can get worse. A lot worse.", "birthday": "2016-11-07T13:10:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-07 13:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 7}

He told Cointelegraph how his previous visit to Argentina in 2013 changed his \u201cwhole perspective on what Bitcoin was and why it mattered.\u201d\n\u201cIn most places I go in the developed world I not only have to explain how Bitcoin works but also why it is necessary,\u201d he said.\n \u201cBut here, they already know why it matters, what they want to know is how and how quickly. It\u2019s a whole other level.\u201d \nThe Argentinean government lifted exchange controls in late 2015, after four years of stringent restrictions and the country, which has experienced several massive bank failures throughout its history, still suffers roughly\u00a040 percent inflation.\nThe first day continued with talks addressing both the potential of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology.\nHowever, RSK Labs CEO and co-organizer of the conference Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar noted, in his talk on the \u201cInternet of Value,\u201d that a private or licensed Blockchain brings nothing new to the table.\n\u201cA Blockchain protected by a federation is more transparent but it\u2019s still a closed system,\u201d he said.\n \u201cIf you put the Blockchain in a server it is just a database that can\u2019t be edited. It has no disruptive value.\u201d \nAntonopoulos agreed:\n \u201cPrivate Blockchain is a contradiction in terms, it makes as much sense as private internet, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d \nRodolfo Andragnes, another of the co-organizers and MC of the conference, said that they acknowledge that \u201cthe world is talking about Blockchain, and belittle Bitcoin.\u201d He told Cointelegraph that companies ask them about the Blockchain so he \u201ctakes that as a starting point, where they are comfortable, and then move on to explain how Bitcoin is still relevant.\u201d\nThe event attracted Bitcoin newcomers eager to learn more about the cryptocurrency as well as veterans. For the old timers, the second day of the conference offered some of the most awaited talks focused on technical issues, including Zooko Wilcox\u2019s presentation on the new anonymous cryptocurrency Zcash, the launch of Tumeric, the testnet of Rootstock Bitcoin\u2019s smart contracts platform, and Bitcoin Core developer and keynote speaker Peter Todd.\nRSK Labs co-founder and Bitcoin security expert Sergio Lerner explained that they have \u201c30 percent of the Bitcoin merge miners already testing Rootstock software\u201d and an additional 50 percent have expressed their intention to merge mine Rootstock. He also announced companies such as Jaxx, Wings, and Torguen are working with the smart contracts platform to start creating the ecosystem. Finally, he said that Rootstock production network Ginger will be available in April 2017.", "birthday": "2016-11-09T16:45:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-09 16:45:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 9}

Very few have seen this as a positive development within the spectrum of Bitcoin.\nThis has been a constant source of consternation inside and outside of the Bitcoin mining community since the aforementioned evidence of mining life became apparent in 2014, when\u00a0China flipped the Bitcoin production script.\nRegarding this topic, Bitcoin mentor, and master orator\u00a0Andreas Antonopoulos has a unique take on how this, in the overall sphere of things, may be considered a positive rather than negative development.\nAs the featured speaker at the recent Los Angeles Bitcoin Meetup, Andreas was asked directly about Bitcoin centralization in China, where over 70 percent of all Bitcoin mining takes place and about 95 percent of all global\u00a0Bitcoin trading.\nChina\u2019s Growth\nWhy this is an issue is questionable, since this scenario has existed for more than two years, of which the Bitcoin community has not suffered to any noticeable degree in comparison to when it was an American industry pre-2014.\nAndreas quipped that if this centralization took place in Sweden, the community would not be so chastened;\n \u201cHonestly, we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation if it was \u2018mining centralization in Sweden.\u2019 Everyone would be going \u201cYah! Awesome!\u201d\u201d \nRegarding the issue itself, Andreas\u2019 viewpoint is original and worth considering. No one has shown any grand conspiracy to centralize\u00a0Bitcoin in China for the sheer act of centralizing the industry for control.\nIt is simply a coincidence, in addition to China\u2019s overall economic and industrial expansion, leveraging the growth of Bitcoin simultaneously. They just happen to co-exist in the same country at the same time.\nAccording to Andreas, there exists a massive influx of electrical production taking place in China since 2012, with new plants being produced as quickly as one every sixteen hours in order to deal with China\u2019s rapid growth.\nLast year, according to\u00a0Greenpeace, China\u2019s government approved over 150 coal power plants over the first nine months of 2015, which equates to four new plants a week. This number does not include Chinese hydro-electric plants also being produced, en masse.\nThis creates basically an excess of power that is currently being used by Chinese Bitcoin miners to turn this excess energy, which otherwise would not be used at all or would be wasted energy, into an economic engine for Bitcoin production. Andreas called Bitcoin a \u201cbattery\u201d for China\u2019s economic growth, which is where the applauding of China\u2019s Bitcoin mining industry comes in.

Since Cello now works in the medical field and Redox is a medical records api this interview gets downright nerdy with healthcare, blockchain and marketing related chit-chat.\u00a0\n \u201cThe blockchain ain't nothing but a hackable database that\u2019s daisy chained.\u201d - Some PAB \nIn this short episode we get spoon fed a healthy buffet of knowledge on the practical and applicable side of the blockchain. The least likely of places we\u2019d expect to learn about HealthCare is on a bitcoin podcast, let alone The Bitcoin Podcast, but oddly enough this is where crypto technology has taken us in 2016. Started from the Crypto now we\u2019re here! Listening to how medical technology could utilize the blockchain is an auditory refreshment to the money, money, money, talk associated with blockchain technology. These are the killer apps bitcoin has been waiting for and they are proving that bitcoin is much, much more than just money. Remember, the currency that is bitcoin is the byproduct of a bigger machine that is Bitcoin.\u00a0\n \u201cBlockchain accelerates the topic of security & privacy concerns.\u201d - QuHarrison Terry \nIn this 30 minute interview the show takes us to the peak of Mount Nerd-e-ness to gather some wisdom from the wise men that are James and QuHarrison.

", "content": "The presidential elections in the United States are here and we will know who will be the next president in a couple of days. The rise of Donald Trump has been a phenomenon of sorts. Trump, the Republican Party candidate, is far from your mainstream politician. He is brash, controversial and some might even say crude. There is no denying though that he has ridden a wave of populism.\nTrump, a billionaire and reality television personality, famous for his show The Apprentice, is considered a favourite candidate of the little people. He has been described as the \u2018Penthouse Populist\u2019 by USA Today, which described the support for the candidate in rural America in these words:\n \u201cDrive an hour or two outside of any major U.S. city, however \u2013 Washington, D.C., for example \u2013 and campaign signs for Trump dominate the countryside: nestled in soybean fields and thick woods; beside two-lane highways and shotgun houses. Support for Clinton is hard to find, if it exists at all.\u201d \nAre Bitcoin Libertarians Fuelling the Trump Phenomenon?\nTrump has garnered the support of the rural masses in the US but there is also another group that has rallied behind him - the Bitcoin community. David Golumbia, author of the book \u201cThe Politics of Bitcoin - Software as Right-Wing Extremism,\u201d makes the case about how cyberlibertarianism is a product of far-right political thought.\nYet if we look superficially, David Golumbia maybe onto something. Trump is perceived to be positive for the progression of Bitcoin, with even CNBC making the case as far back as July 2016. It is just that they believe that whereas Trump\u2019s election may negatively impact fiat currencies, Bitcoin may begin to thrive. Cointelegraph too has covered Trump and his impact on Bitcoin.\nOur coverage, it should be said, has been fairly balanced on this account. A positive trend in Bitcoin due to a Trump presidency could thus be construed to be a reason why some Bitcoin enthusiasts might support Trump.\nWe know that as recently as October 2016 saw a large donation from the Bitcoin community to Trump, with Peter Thiel, an investor in BitPay, donating $1.25 mln to Trump\u2019s campaign, according to the New York Times.\nTrump is not popular with the techworld\nWhile Bitcoin attracts a certain type of libertarian crowd, the \u2018mainstream\u2019 tech world is less than enthusiastic about Trump. There is even a scathing letter from Silicon Valley leaders that attack Trump\u2019s lack of vision and his policies.\nAn excerpt from this letter states:\n \u201cWe also believe in the free and open exchange of ideas, including over the Internet, as a seed from which innovation springs. Donald Trump proposes \u201cshutting down\u201d parts of the Internet as a security strategy\u200a\u2014\u200ademonstrating both poor judgment and ignorance about how technology works. His penchant to censor extends to revoking press credentials and threatening to punish media platforms that criticize him.\u201d \nClearly, Mr. Trump has failed to captivate the tech world with his rantings against immigration and the shutting down of his critics. CNBC states that while the Trump campaign has managed to raise only $300,000 from Silicon Valley, Clinton has raised nearly $8 mln.\nThe Bitcoin community, thus, remains one of the few areas of the tech world where you might actually find true Trump supporters.\nA Libertarian Wet Dream", "birthday": "2016-11-07T10:04:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-07 10:04:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 7}

Story of InkaPay, South American Blockchain Platform for People ", "content": "Founders of a South American Blockchain platform InkaPay tell Cointelegraph about how it was launched and how it penetrates to the areas where many unbanked people live.\nBitInka was founded in Nov. 2013, in Lima, Peru,\u00a0by a group of entrepreneurs and it took a whole year to develop the platform.\nBitInka\u2019s first goal was to deal with Blockchain technology as a local exchange. After the project was started, its founders had to put it on hold for almost half a year due to lack of initial funds.\nRestrictions\nAfter half a year of sitting with the initial project and traveling around South America, they noticed that all the countries in the region did not have a solution regarding the use of different fiat currencies and also that there was a huge problem with currency exchange restrictions in several countries such as Argentina,\u00a0Brasil, and Venezuela.\nIn some of them, \u00a0you could face harsh exchange restriction and penalties if dealing in anything other\u00a0than the local fiat currency. This is when the real idea became imminent to the founders, who were immigrants that faced these restrictions. \u00a0\nThe use of a\u00a0decentralized financial vehicle\u00a0to target remittances and payments was the key idea.\nIt wouldn\u2019t intervene with any exchange restriction laws and by using something open to the public, it would be completely transparent. It also wouldn\u2019t affect the local economy by intervening with capital flight.\nBlockchain technology was the perfect solution but the task wasn\u2019t easy and the creators had to open a legal business in each country that had a remittance channel and then develop it into a trusted exchange.\nIncas, Gold and Bitcoin\nBitcoin was the cryptocurrency they chose to develop this great idea then as the founder roots where Peruvian. As the history of the Incas in South America is quite strong and since Incas and Bitcoin relate naturally to gold, it was named BitInka.\nThe exchange platform continued its development and basic local trading was done by the founders in between different countries to test the idea and see if it could work.\nThe result was optimal fees when compared to traditional methods as these were reduced in half, e-commerce was implemented into the idea for cross-border payments and there was a great benefit on exchange rates as well.\nPeru led the way\nThe founders \u00a0then decided to pursue this development. They left their jobs, grabbed all their investments and injected them into the beginning of a great startup venue.\nLegal companies constitution started with Peru leading the way followed by Bolivia, Brasil, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Chile, and Spain.\nThe challenge here was not only opening the companies but also to convince local banks to work with them.\nAt the beginning, the word Bitcoin was so feared in banks that conversations wouldn\u2019t even last 5 minutes. It took them some time to develop AML & KYC processes and work with lawyers to convince banks that this was something real.\nBanks jumped on the bandwagon\nThe main purpose was to use Blockchain technologies to benefit not only the people but also banks themselves. The banks would be able to penetrate markets where they didn\u2019t have any business before.\nThe business plan was redrafted. The idea was not buying and selling Bitcoins. The idea had to be described as it was thought at the beginning as a decentralized vehicle that will not hurt nor influence local banks and it had to be seen as an innovative product that uses a disruptive technology, transparent to the users to acquire a final product or service.\nSuddenly doors started to open and the biggest bank in Peru was amazed by the idea.", "birthday": "2016-11-06T15:47:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-06 15:47:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 6}

", "content": "Thursday, October 27th, 2016. Segregated Witness (or SegWit) was added to Bitcoin Core. Will that day be the official end of the two-year-old \u201cBlock Size Debate?\u201d will yesterday be the first step towards a mainstream-ready global decentralized digital currency? Whether you know it or not, Bitcoin has officially stepped into a new era of expansion and usability with the release of Bitcoin Core 0.13.1. Here, we\u2019ll give you a cliffnotes version of what happens next and if we are even ready for SegWit.\nThis can get uber-technical, but don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not the one to lay out all the source code for you. What I can do is provide you with an understandable shorthand guide on how we all can start to enjoy its fruits, if we so choose to. And you see, Bitcoin\u2019s 0.13.1 update doesn\u2019t automatically activate\u00a0SegWit for the world.\nLet us review what\u00a0SegWit is and how it's potential helps users going forward. First and foremost, it is capable of effectively increasing the effective block size or efficiency of each block by at least 60% over the current state, if not more.\nThis is how block capacity will improve, according to Bitcoin Core:\n \u201cSince old nodes will only download the witness-stripped block, they only enforce the 1 MB block size limit rule on that data. New nodes, which understand the full block with witness data, are therefore free to replace this limit with a new one, allowing for larger block sizes. Segregated witness, therefore, takes advantage of this opportunity to raise the block size limit to nearly 4 MB, and adds a new cost limit to ensure blocks remain balanced in their resource use (this effectively results in an effective limit closer to 1.6 to 2 MB). People who run upgraded wallets will be able to take advantage of the increased block size by moving signatures to the witness section of the transaction.\u201d \nClaimed benefits\nThere are several claimed benefits, besides a noticeable\u00a0block size adjustment. Ultimately, miners will benefit in any future hardfork that changes the block capacity limit to be a single weighted sum of parameters. This lets miners easily and accurately fill blocks while maximizing fee income. This will also benefit users by allowing them to more reliably calculate the appropriate fee needed for their transaction to be mined.\nThis should help smaller miners using SPV nodes to operate with less space and required bandwidth.\u00a0The Lightning Network integration will be so much easier to implement once SegWit is adopted. The Network will be significantly more efficient in its use of space on the Blockchain. With third-party and scriptSig malleability removed, it also becomes possible to run lightweight Lightning clients that outsource monitoring the Blockchain, instead of each Lightning client needing to also be a full Bitcoin node.\nOther benefits include making it easier for wallet providers to check the status of outgoing Bitcoin transactions. Smart contracts on the Blockchain can be easier to add, monitor and create. And removing the quadratic scaling of hashed data for verifying signatures makes increasing the block size safer in the future.\nIt is just an option, not a dictatorship", "birthday": "2016-10-28T16:20:00+01:00", "date": "2016-10-28 15:20:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 28}

Notice that when the effect of such factors subside afterwards, the price of Bitcoin doesn't get to revert to its initial point before the main push.

The nation\u2019s exports unexpectedly shrank the most in seven months in September, according to official data. This is in addition to the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s weakening its exchange rate 4.4 percent in three days in August 2015.\nA reduced supply factor\nHodling - or holding onto - the top digital currency, seems to be having a strengthening effect on the value and price of Bitcoin. This trend seems to take Bitcoin off the market, reduces the supply available to everyone else, and increases the price as a result.

But actually...... there is one more thing I should probably spill the beans on.\n People keep asking me: \u201cHow much longer?\u201d... \u201cWhen will they finally be arrested?\u201d .... \u201cWhat's taking so long?\u201d ... \u201cWhy are they not shut down yet?\u201d \nActually, I want to pacify all those people on the one hand; and on the other, I don't want to see more victims fall for this new bait, put up huge sums of money, and give it to the mob to do their dirty work! So, I will share with you another tidbit, which, actually, is no tidbit at all, but a serious bomb \u2026 Okay, make that two bombs!\nFirst off, I want to say that we made a couple of dozen arrests already, so, rest easy on that one! They are not getting off scot-free! We have stepped on their tails real good! They are just hiding this fact from everyone! We even arrested the Crypto-Witch, herself! ...... People think I exaggerate when I call her that! They think I hype it up or use the term 'witch' figuratively or have some personal vendetta against her! Actually, no. \u00a0\n Ruja Ignatova is no Ph.D. from Oxford or anywhere else, for that matter! She bought her diploma just like\u00a0the Serbian President bought his! \nTalk about birds of a feather, co-scammers and fraudsters, but on a much higher level! They are both criminals and shysters, and have no conscience whatsoever! No wonder they fell in love with each other! But don't let me get ahead of myself...\nSo, we finally arrest the Druid Witch, nailing her on her broom in... Well, actually, no, it was on her yacht in Spain - with 242 kg of cocaine on board! This, you will not hear anywhere else! I am sure I will be seriously reprimanded up the wazoo for sharing this with you all, but there, you have it! People need to open their eyes finally, and stop believing this gypsy witch, who is effecting mind control over them! They need to snap right out of it! I explained this pictorially in my last update on my Petition and it is worth the short read, as you will see it clearly in the pictures, if you have been blind to it up until now. Here is the continuation of that as when you see the pictures I lay out, you can clearly see she is purposely effecting mind control over her subjects!\nSo, why is the witch not in jail if this is true? Actually, her bail was set at a whopping \u20ac10 mln before our guys would set her temporarily free! Now, I ask you: how could Onecoin possibly have all that extra disposable cash to pay out millions and millions of euro's worth of bail bonds and bribes, and still double the Onecoins for 2.5 mln members, and pay out all that commission, when the price of their Onecoin NoCoins keeps on supposedly rising?! - Impossible! People are simply not doing the math! They have no idea how unsustainable this ponzi scheme and compensation plan is! It is ludicrous! It is not about nor has it ever been about anyone earning any money in this pit from hell! It has always been about a pie-in-the-sky dream for dreamers in dream land, who have no critical thinking whatsoever, who are, therefore, all too easy to hypnotize and bewitch to put up every last cent they have before the MobSquad takes that cash and stashes it offshore in a different name, so, it's untraceable and spoken for! Then, they will be left with nothing to sue them with! That is the plan! Cause you'd have to do it in Bulgaria, and who wants to go to Bulgaria and sit there for all the proceedings when they bought off law enforcement over there, anyway?!.... So then, they can do a disappearing act on everyone to some exotic place in the world, certainly after bribing every respective politician and rogue agent they need to along the way! This was always the plan! ... But they never expected they would run into me! They just expected everyone had a price... So, it was all under control, they figured that no one would be the wiser because everyone is greedy!\nPeople need to take this seriously, and do their research! Witchcraft is real! It is old-hat for born gypsies like Ruja Ignatova, and I will tell you, she is very skilled in her craft, make no mistake! Even other witches, like Madonna, admit that Ruja Ignatova is wicked as can be, and couldn't care less about hurting 2.5 mln people and their families! And don't ask me how I know!... This explains the phenomenon of why it is 'impossible' to convince OneLifers they are tangled in a scam! No..... for them, they just bow down, singing: 'Hail, Queen!' It's like talking to brick walls! Have you noticed that? You prove it up and down, forwards, sideways and backwards, and then the OneLife Zombie just stares at you blankly, like a deer in headlights, saying: 'Prove it!,' when you just did till you're blue in the face! Their critical thinking is totally shut down! Their minds are clouded over seriously! They have no judgement or discernment whatsoever, and their eyes are wide shut! They need a deliverance, as all are in collective captivity!\nThis phenomenon is as real as the night is dark, so, I don't care if technocrats have no knowledge of what I'm talking about..... I'm telling you, OneLifers need an exorcism! They lost their faculties and have no thinking mind left! And if you've experienced West Africa, which is the voodoo capital of the world as I have or Haiti or other pockets where witchcraft and voodoo abounds, you would have seen exactly this phenomenon time and again, and would be able to recognize it in an instant! And people will not just snap out of it easily, I must say! They need serious power prayers, tower prayers, a deliverance, exorcism, call it what you will, to come out of this! I talk till I'm blue in the face, and none of them.... Absolutely not one can hear you! They all have this lost, blank stare, they think they're all wise, that you don't know what you're talking about, you are just a hater, negative, out for revenge, hate their queenie or have an axe to grind! Actually, I thank God I invested not one dime and did not sign up anyone; so, I have nothing whatsoever to lose or gain from this! And everyone has always said I'm the most positive person with an infectious enthusiasm, and a motivational speaker, so, I speak what I know, as I see what others do not and am fair to warn them in spite of themselves! The rest is on them if they are too rebellious to research this out, report them themselves, and get themselves the help they need to pull out of this cult they find themselves in that is dragging them under and will gobble up every last cent they have!\nI am extremely deft in spiritual matters, and this is why, no doubt, God had my path cross Onecoin! Mark my words, otherwise, to this day, they would be much more vast, there would be far greater detriment, they would have raked in many more millions, and sucked in hundreds of thousands of more victims, and perhaps millions!.... So, for that, I thank God He used me as an instrument to help put a stop to this carnage, and apply triage to stop the bleeding - as this kind of esoteric knowledge is not common. The average Joe is not privy to this, and would not take on this fight, and if he did, he would not win! Make no mistake: we are fighting evil powers here, and an insidious underground ring that has been operating for a long time! They are using Onecoin as a front, a new vehicle with a discreet means of transferring millions of euros quietly, away from the prying eyes of righteous regulators! Did I just call regulators righteous?... Lemme' just skip over that one!", "birthday": "2016-10-30T13:05:00+00:00", "date": "2016-10-30 13:05:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 30}

There\u2019s been a real shift in the attitudes of the public on the importance of privacy, especially when it comes to something as private as their finances.\n I think revelations of email hacks, the Edward Snowden leaks, and other government snooping all contribute to a greater awareness and demand for better privacy in communication and financial transactions. \nIt\u2019s likely this demand and awareness is what's contributed to the growth of privacy-centric solutions.\nCT: What does privacy mean to you?\nRT: Privacy is a fundamental human right, yet it\u2019s being eroded by technology from aerial drones to monitoring of our digital profiles. Thankfully, technology can also contribute to privacy, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to help level the playing field between individual rights and mass-scale monitoring of the population.\nCT: What is so dear to anonymous crypto lovers?\nRT: I think if you asked them, they would say anonymity is an essential thing. But that shouldn\u2019t have to come at the expense of everything else. What good is a cryptocurrency for example, if it doesn\u2019t interface with anything? At the end of the day, money is an essential tool for everyday life. It should be both useful and easy to use. Many users place too much value on the technical aspects of an anonymity solution, but when the rubber hits the road, they actually care more whether they can use it. We are mindful not to ignore the other aspects of creating a valuable ecosystem that will delight users.\nCT: Do you think Bitcoin will be forced by the current upsurge of anonymous digital money to go anonymous?\nRT: I believe that Bitcoin\u2019s issues are more drastic than matching a single feature of other coins.\n Bitcoin lacks the mechanisms even to address a question like whether to make a significant change to their protocol such as anonymity. \nSo, I don\u2019t think any one feature will force Bitcoin to change. More than likely, a coin like Dash that offers users a variety of features will eventually overtake Bitcoin, and it will take a major event like that to persuade the network to incorporate radical change.\nCT: With an ever increasing government's interference & prying into people's private affairs, is anonymous digital currency the future?\nRT: It\u2019s not yet clear how the digital currency landscape will evolve, but it will ultimately be up to user and business demand. While there is certainly a demand for fully anonymous solutions, there is also the need for fully transparent ones. There is also a conflict between the interests of many users for greater privacy and governments which would like greater access to our private affairs. Although governments could not stop decentralized currencies from operating, they are certainly not powerless in influencing their use. After all, they have tremendous power to regulate the entry and exit points to the legacy financial system - connections which are very much needed to provide a useful service to customers.

The price is more than 20% down. Will the fall continue?\nETH/USD\nAfter Ethereum has rebounded from the diagonal channel near $13, Ether had two options: fortify at $13 and form the third wave towards $15, or fortify at $11.5 and go down to the bottom limit of the long-term flat.\nThe market has chosen the downward scenario. The medium-term downward trend has been forming since late September. It\u2019s at the level of $11.5, where the future structure was decided: either the flat could end and be followed by powerful growth, or it could continue with a strong fall. Ultimately, the downward trend, which has started at $14.5, has reached its minimal target, and is now a proper wave of the long-term flat, which has started as early as this summer, following a powerful fall of Ether\u2019s price. That flat is clearly observed by the majority of traders, as are its limits. In order to determine the borders of this sideway movement with higher precision, we need to find the starting points, from which the price has been forming this trend in the past.\n\nThe limits of this long-term flat are also confirmed by the buy and sell stop-orders in that area. As can be seen, there are large volumes currently concentrated there. The traders expect to buy or sell Ethereum at the peak points of the price, hoping for a new wave of the flat to form. That tactic is a popular one. However, placing stop orders at those levels is highly risky, because any big player can take advantage of them - just as it has happened at the level of $11.5. For the majority of traders, the point of $11.5 was the peak of a rebound towards the $7.5-$14.5 upward trend. Because of that, there was the largest accumulated volume of buy orders in that area, as opposed to the bottom limit of the flat at $9.5. This has resulted in a great opportunity for a big seller to get rid of the largest volume of Ether beyond the $11.5 line. After that, they could buy it back from the same traders, which would be afraid of a possibility of an even more powerful fall, and would start selling near $10. That\u2019s why this whole situation is resulting in the price going from one technical level to another.\nAt the moment, the most prominent trend is a downward one. For the price to make a turn, it has to break through a key level at $12.5. As we can see, there are large volumes of sell orders at the crossing point of the Fibonacci 38% retracement and the diagonal channel, which confirms the importance of that resistance line. The $12.5 mark is the most likely peak for the rebound towards the downward trend, which has started at $14.5. Because of that, that area can be a starting point for either a further turn upward towards $14.5, or a new fall towards at least the $9.5 limit of the flat. The behavior of Ether\u2019s price at that level is important. If the graph manages to fortify at that mark, there will be a chance for a turn to growth.\n", "birthday": "2016-11-01T11:33:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-01 11:33:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 1}

However, it is still difficult to speculate the future of SegWit due to the decisions of several major miners to prevent the SegWit release.\nMiners split\nSpecifically, ViaBTC (6% hashpower) and Bitcoin.com (2.2% hashpower) are supporting Bitcoin Unlimited, a hard fork proposal that enables miners to openly choose the size of blocks that they deem fit.\nSince a soft fork activation requires 95 percent of hashpower, theoretically, ViaBTC and Bitcoin.com mining pools could stop the activation of SegWit if their hashpower remains intact.\nAt the moment, 90.27% of hashpower is in support of Bitcoin Core while the other 10% supports other alternative proposals like Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic.", "birthday": "2016-11-01T12:40:00+00:00", "date": "2016-11-01 12:40:00", "year": 2016, "month": 11, "day": 1}

Several other cryptocurrencies attempted to expand on Bitcoin\u2019s privacy, such as Darkcoin (before rebranding as Dash and pursuing more broad goals) and Monero. In late summer this year, Monero surged as cryptocurrency entered a new privacy-centric hype cycle. Recently, its price and hype have adjusted as possible competitor Zcash debuted too much hype, and possibly due to discontent over current lack of a functional graphical user interface (GUI) wallet.\nBipCoin, a new currency based on the same CryptoNote technology as Monero (and created out of respect for Monero\u2019s mission), recently released a functional GUI wallet for Windows and Linux. The coin is named after the BipCot No-Government License, a license that allows any individual or company to use the product except for governments and government agents, and uses a cat as its logo in homage to Dogecoin\u2019s dog.\nCointelegraph spoke with Michael W. Dean, developer for BipCoin, about making CryptoNote privacy-driven coins fun and usable, taking cryptocurrency \u2018to Alpha-Centauri.\u2019\nCointelegraph: Why the name? What does BipCot mean?\nMichael W. Dean: BEASTLICK INTERNET POLICY COMMISSION OUTREACH TEAM. It's myself and Derrick Slopey's software company. We created that when we made FeenPhone (HQ VOiP better than Skype for radio hosts and podcasters) and MeowBit (dot-bit domain resolver for Namecoin). This was a few years ago. \u2018Beastlick\u2019 is like [middle of nowhere], since Derrick and I live in the sticks, him in Mine, me in Wyoming.\nCT: It's based on CryptoNote, just like Monero, correct? What are the key differences and similarities between the two?\nMWD: Ours is much closer to original ByteCoin, theirs is \u2018off on their own tree\u2019 as FluffyPony from Monero told me. Monero is great, but they haven't worked much on widespread adoption. I think the fact that they don't have a working, solid GUI wallet is the reason their price went down after going up, after the AlphaBay announcement. By the way, BipCoin came out the day BEFORE that announcement.\nCT: I understand that BipCoin beat Monero to the GUI wallet game, is this correct?\nMWD: Well, there are third-party Monero wallets, but they are so wonky, it would be fair to say Monero does not have a GUI wallet.\nCT: BipCoin is a much more recent coin that I'll gather has much less development resources. Why did it win out in the race to the GUI? Different developmental priorities?\nMWD: Yes. We just wanted to make it solid and basic and functional. We actually had issues with first release, killed it for a month, then realized it was still being mining and worked. I do not hide this, and this is a plus, not a minus. It was unkillable. We got a new, better team, with Derrick, slb and Makis, made it solid and relaunched.

The likelihood of the price growing or falling by 50% is quite high. Which direction will Ether choose?\nETH/USD\nAn upward rebound towards the downward trend from $14.5 to $11.6, which was predicted earlier, has been naturally formed. The rise of Ether\u2019s price towards at least the diagonal channel near $13 was necessary. This gives Ether a decent support from the bulls. This rebound was as natural, as the micro-flat which is currently present on the charts. All that is due to the fact that the current price isn\u2019t unprofitable for both bears and bulls, short-term-wise.\nVolatility usually grows at peak values, which is explained by the fact that the majority of traders show themselves at such points.\nIn the current structure, such values are expected at the following marks:\n The peak of the downward movement near $11.5. The peak of the correction of that downward trend near $13. \nIt seems that the price has stopped about the center between these two marks, and hence, the majority of traders in this situation remains vague.\nThe target of the upward correction towards the diagonal channel near $13 has been reached. That means that the structure of the movement is prepared for both upward and downward movement in the medium term.\n\nTwo weeks earlier the situation was definitely looking in favour of the bulls. That was indicated by the volume of buy orders being twice as large as that of the sell orders. The technical analysis was also indicative of likely growth. These predictions were correct.\nHowever, if we take a look at the volumes of stop orders now, the forces are almost equal.\nA large volume of buy orders up to $11.5 will slow the price down within that range, and the sell orders near $13.5 will provide serious resistance for the upward trend. That\u2019s why the prices of $11.5 and $13.5 will be the levels, where the medium-term trend is most likely to begin.\nIf Ether\u2019s price returns to the $11.5 mark, there will be two possible scenarios: either the movement will become the peak of a rebound towards the upward trend from $7 to $14, or a turn will form, and the third downward wave will be formed of a similar scale to the first one, which took place from $14.5 to $11.6. That means that for both scenarios, we need to see upward movement from the $11.5 mark. In the first case, an upward trend will begin, and in the second, there will be a fortification and an upward rebound. Naturally, we should also be prepared for an emergency, which could lead to the price simply collapsing. Similar scenarios in the opposite direction are expected at the $13 resistance.\nUltimately, unless the advantage is taken by either bulls or bears, Ether\u2019s price will simply form a sideways movement between the two key levels of $11.5 and $13.5.\n", "birthday": "2016-10-25T12:20:00+01:00", "date": "2016-10-25 11:20:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 25}

As a result, we came to the point where Razormind can be compared to the Kryptos, \u00a0a sculpture by the American artist Jim Sanborn that is located on the grounds of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Langley, Virginia. Since its dedication on November 3, 1990, there has been much speculation about the meaning of the four encrypted messages it bears. Of the four messages, the first three have been solved, while the fourth message remains as one of the most famous unsolved codes in the world.\nRazormind claims\nJawad Yaqub, the CEO of Razormind Ltd, first contacted me in June to write about their operations and upcoming crowdsale. I stayed in contact with Jawad and the core group for around four months afterwards. This gave me access to a lot of evidence of what was going on and I will be releasing the details throughout a few articles of which this is the first.\nIn relation to the allegations that Razormind and Razor, the cryptocoin that became known as Razorcoin, were connected: I can state as factual that there is no association whatsoever between the two, as the developer of Razorcoin has publicly acknowledged.\nRazormind claimed to be a global company with 260 employees worldwide with offices in London, Manchester, Vancouver and Belfast. At this stage we can confirm that they have indeed different members of the core team in three of these four locations, but we can find no trace of offices except in Belfast. There is evidence of a number of freelance workers globally and an IT or data centre registered in London, but we can not find evidence to confirm the number of employees.\nUK military base connection\nThe registered business address is based at 55 Clive Road, Holywood, Co.Down in Northern Ireland. We can confirm this is not offices nor in a residential area and that it is located inside a United Kingdom\u2019s military base. However, we have no way to verify or deny their involvement in this business operation.\nIn relation to the claims that Razormind has been working on DeOS for a number of years and had 27,000 registered users. The only evidence that I can find in regards to any users in the past is in an interview done with Jawad the CEO, by the Melbourne Bitcoin Technology Centre\u00a0and a Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin Episode 177 podcast from January 2015, where commenters underneath claim to have access to DeOS operating system.\nThe articles published in numerous publications in early September mention a partnership between Bitcoin Association of Northern Ireland and Razormind, as well as offices, a Blockchain lab and 20 paid interns. I can confirm this was a work in progress a number of months ago. Although discussions took place between myself on behalf of BANI with comprehensive explanations of the numerous benefits for N.Ireland, no final agreement was concluded, nor were any documents produced or signed.\nThere has been confirmation of a lease of offices in the prestigious Scottish Provident Building in Belfast and that the recruitment of interns is in motion, as well as proof of two Bitcoin ATMs ordered and paid for to locate in N.Ireland.\nShrouded in mystery\nIn relation to their claims in the article about Razormind working with banks and financial institutions on Blockchain use cases, I was provided with a list of their names, had included it in the published article only to be asked to cut it on day one by Jawad, stating that that was private information not meant for the public domain.\nThe DeOS tokens have and still are being distributed to those who invested in them, including myself, and the only problem we can find is that some people used the wrong types of Bitcoin wallets.", "birthday": "2016-10-25T13:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-10-25 12:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 25}

In a world where the newer generation is increasingly transfixed by technological distractions like mobile phones and video games, keeping up to date matters.\nThis is not Disney\u2019s first toying with Blockchain. In fact Disney conducted a Blockchain marriage at the Disney World Bitcoin Conference way back in 2014. We have also covered the news of Disney looking for Blockchain talent in recent times.\nWhat is Dragonchain?\nDragonchain was released to the public on October 2, 2016 with a modified Apache 2 open source license.\nThe purpose of the Blockchain is to help businesses track and trade anything of value without requiring a central point of control. Basically Dragonchain is yet another Blockchain which helps maintain records and processes transactions. This is similar to what Bitcoin is based on, but a bit different as well.\nIn a document released that details the architecture of Dragonchain, Disney says, \u201cIn Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies, we witness the use of \u201cProof of Work\u201d (PoW) algorithms as a basis for consensus in a \u201ctrustless\u201d system. In this architecture, \u201cproof\u201d will be abstracted and may be implemented in one or more ways for a given Blockchain. For some uses, one may desire to use a trust based system, for instance, in a fully private Blockchain system. One may also find value in a hybrid proof configuration that would see trust applied alongside limited Proof of Work to add additional security against attack (i.e. a potential attacker would not only need to compromise or attain a set of private keys, but would also need to perform computation to accomplish the configured Proof to reassemble a given Blockchain.\u201d", "birthday": "2016-10-24T17:39:00+01:00", "date": "2016-10-24 16:39:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 24}

My War Against OneCoin, Part 2. ", "content": "Angelina Lazar, rogue economist and cryptocurrency revolutionary tells Cointelegraph all about her war with OneCoin.\u00a0In Part 1 of her story, Lazar gave her view of OneCoin founder Ruja Ignatova. Here in Part 2, Angelina accuses Boyko Borisov, Prime Minister of Bulgaria, and the Serbian President Tomislav Nikolic of taking bribes from OneCoin, and asks what role Joe Biden, Vice President of the USA, had to play.\nCointelegraph: What happened after no one at meeting with OneCoin leaders can answer you who, after all, audits OneCoin?\nAngelina Lazar: Riitta had escaped as soon as I began my presentation, slipping out, without me even noticing!\nOnly someone who knows OneCoin is an outright scam, who does not want to be found out, but wants to hide in the shadows, and put you on the front line, jeopardizing your credibility and life, but staying safe, themselves! \u00a0\nNext, I arranged via Riitta a meeting with Petri Valila at the Burj Khalifa, who was her partner to meet with my Serbian Leader, Zoran Markovic, whom I'd invited to Dubai for the Training. Zoran represented an active payment processing platform, up and running in Serbia, with 80,000 merchants already, which would allow us to take the OneCoin live! I thought Ruja would jump at the opportunity, as I assumed this was the last piece of the puzzle she needed to legitimize the OneCoin! Petri was one of the first five people in OneCoin, and was the first to hold a meeting (which was in Finland), so, they had some seniority, but was it a rotten apple, as far as I was concerned. He acted as a gatekeeper, which I found extremely odd, as Riitta kept saying \u201cThere are those who decide whether or not someone would meet [Queen Witch Ruja]\u201d, although she didn't use that exact terminology... I found that very bizarre and totally ridiculous! Soon, I found out that Ruja was petrified to meet me, and her mouth trembles whenever she says my name. She made sure, at all costs, that would never happen! But she'll \u00a0meet me at court, that's for sure!\nI am on that witch's tail every step of the way, and will gladly slap down every one of her shenanigans fast, her head is spinning....\nSo, Zoran went to meet Ruja in Sofia, and I did not, as that was a taboo for the Witch! He later informed me that their meeting lasted only 15 minutes, that Ruja could not look them in the eye; and that she was totally not interested in taking the OneCoin live! Aha! ....\nSo, the ultimate goal then was only to extort money from people as fast as possible, to hold it as long as possible, and to stave off their being able to cash in their OneCoin NoCoins as long as they possibly could! - Red flag!... Game over! This was a hornet's nest I found myself in, and I could have nothing whatsoever to do with this veritable charade and sheer mega scam!\nI surprisingly find out that all the top Anti-Leaders were meeting in Dubai during the Leadership Training Week I organized! Yet, not a single one of them came to the event! What kind of leadership was that!? I've never seen that before in the industry! Usually, the leaders are the stars of the show, are more than willing to motivate everyone; to train them, and give their raving testimonials, to teach the newbies the business and show them how to succeed! They are only more than happy to answer their questions and concerns! That is never a burden for them, but an honour and joy! - Not this MobSquad! They were there for their own selfish purposes and regular meeting! Dubai was their hideaway and oasis! At this particular time, they all had their accounts frozen, I discovered, so they were working with the authorities to get them unfrozen! Everything smelled of seriously bad fish at the seashore, on a piping hot Dubai day, where the stench just kept getting more and more rotten, you become nauseous!\nNo.... These were no leaders at all! They all had heads the size of football fields, exorbitant egos, zero interest in having anything whatsoever to do with their downlines; were very elitist snobbish, cold and calculating, heartless and cruel, thankless and bossy, full of themselves and distant to the n-th degree! These were another sort, and all that, I disdained and had no tolerance for! So, why were THEY running the show if they are not leaders? It soon became very clear! They were paid big money to do so; were serial criminals as well, and con-artists, shysters and mobsters, and birds of a feather with the MobSquad! Juha Parhiala is a Mob Boss and owns a percentage of the Company! Sebastian Greenwood is a known con-artist in the Industry, Kari Wahlroos smuggled hormones and alcohol in the 90s! I could go on and on about every member of the OneLife MobSquad and the Anti-Leaders who are the sort they need to protect them! They need eyes and ears on the ground to oust highly troublesome people like myself instantaneously! But I didn't go quietly, and I don't take their lead! I am a real leader, solid as can be, and deal only with righteous business models.... And if they dare to come my way, and try to use me to promote them, there will be serious repercussions, as I will not let that pass!\nSo, these anti-lie-aiders would keep tight control for the MobSquad! Anyone who started messing their nose where it definitely belonged, they would sack instantly (they don't wait), ousting them from the Whatsapp Team Group they're in, and banning them from the weekly meetings! They disavow for anyone to ask any questions or do their own research! This was a cult, and these were not leaders, but gatekeepers and spies for the mob! If you had a head on your shoulders and asked pointed, hardcore questions, you got the jilt, and they immediately removed you, no questions asked, and that, pronto, so you were cut off at the core! They did not want you spoiling their game! You had to go - no ifs, ands or buts! They had zero tolerance for anyone with judgement and discernment! Questions, they say, were to be taken up in private with your upline! But the upline NEVER made themselves available! This was the game and just a big hoax to get you out of their way and not open the eyes of the other sheeple! It was the gatekeeper's job to spy out everyone, and immediately oust the dissenters on the spot! Those were the orders! And that, they did.... across the globe, like gestapo's!\nCointelegraph: What actions have you taken so far against OneCoin? Expound upon that for us, would you?\nAngelina Lazar: I argued with the London Metropolitan Police substantially before finally convincing them to take the case - as they wanted everything to go through Action Fraud, which I found to be far too ineffective for such a mega case that entailed a whole lot more than mere internet crime! This case, Iyke, is so massive, that people will drop their jaws when they finally discover the full magnitude of what we're onto! It is no small potatoes run o' the mill scam, but entails money laundering of millions of euros via the back offices of these mobsters, who are into drug trafficking and financing terrorists! You can guess which!...\u00a0The closest thing I can liken this to is when John Gatti, the Mob Boss finally got arrested, convicted; and thrown in prison! But then again, that was just dealing with the New York Mob, which was on a much smaller scale than what we're talking about here! ...\nIn this insidious organized crime network are political leaders you all know and rogue agents that cover the expanse of the globe! This is not some trite lil' missy from Bulgaria who is at the top of some ponzi scheme! Rather, she is a pawn in a much larger, much more sinister crime ring that is at the level of illuminati global elitists and backstage world powers! I will even go so far as to say that we could easily have the international banksters behind this, who are trying to utilize the OneCoin vehicle to maintain hold over people's money with their centralization scheme, full secrecy (and total lack of transparency), so they can maintain an absolute grip and control over people's finances, as they do today! They just fool OneLifers into thinking they found an alternative to banking at long last! But nothing could be further from the truth! OneCoin is worse than any current banking system! They can freeze your account any time, with no repercussions as the dodo-brain members gave them licence to do so! \u00a0And when they freeze your account, they suspend it, and when they suspend it, they steal your money! And that was the name of the game all along! This is how they deal with dissenters, so everyone becomes too afraid to speak out, fight back, and report the criminals! They are enslaved and petrified, paralyzed and silenced, hoping against hope they will unfreeze their account so they can withdraw their money! This is the OneCoin business model, and that was it, all along! They never expected to come across a bulldog, named 'Angelina Lazar,' but did, and this is what will take them down..... All the way down! I will see to it!\nSo, I came to London from Dubai just before the OneCoin Global Event at Wembley Arena, and was arguing with the Metropolitan Police to intercept that charade, but it was only on June 10th that the Police finally understood and acquiesced, and the CID accepted the case! I needed them to handle it, and not just Action Fraud, which was too ineffective and did not have the capacity to deal with this! So, they have it on record that I was the first to report them. However alas, the next day was the London 'Coinmush' Event, so they were not able to organize themselves in time to raid the place. No matter....We were finally on track, and this paved the way now for others to report them to the Police, and file their complaints! The City of London Police have also recently opened an Investigation into OneCoin, and what they take on..... Well, let's just say, they are bulldogs like me!..... They will see it through to the end! And this is the end-game, rest assured! It is only a matter of time . . .\nWe've been receiving on a daily basis 100-200 complaints against OneCoin. Some long weekends, it can amount to 1,000 complaints! We have over 12,000 complaints; but I will take this opportunity to urge everyone to be sure to include their names when filing their complaints with the Police! Do not do it anonymously! And if you did, go back and put your name on it! This is extremely important if you want your complaint to be taken seriously, and in order to get these mobsters prosecuted to the full extent of the law! People should not be so lame, wishy-washy and without a backbone! That is pathetic! You need to fight for what you believe in, fight for your rights, your hard earned money and your commissions! All OneLifers need to hold these mafiozi accountable! That is how you fight a war, and I assure you, this is serious covert warfare carried out on a daily basis, with multiple intelligence agencies watching, law enforcement agencies engaged from around the world, and heads of secret service intently monitoring this blow by blow! This is not a small case, but the motherload of all crime cases, and will go down in history as unprecedented!\nNext..... We took the case to Interpol Global, which was our secret weapon! This was a brilliant move on the part of my old friend and partner-in-anti-crime, Zlatko Djurisic, Ex-Chief Inspector against Organized Crime, Private Detective and Balkan Affairs Specialist (hailed so from the FBI to Mossad for his mastery and firm grip on the region), who works with the structures that be.\nHe made an impeccable move that totally pulled the rug out from underneath OneCoin!\nI attribute that single move to be the key and critical factor of our having gained such huge leverage and control over the situation, spearheading it, and hitting it right out of the ballpark! \u00a0", "birthday": "2016-10-26T10:02:00+01:00", "date": "2016-10-26 09:02:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 26}

", "content": "On May 22, 2010 programmer Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for two Papa John\u2019s pizzas. Today, this humorous anecdote is an integral part of the Bitcoin lore, but behind the veneer of playful naivety, it masks a more sinister truth.\nWith projects under way in many developing countries to register property and people\u2019s homes on the Blockchain, are we courting a disaster? If a sophisticated programmer is so woefully unaware of the value in such a newfangled digital asset, can we expect that a person new to the idea of Blockchain, and new to the idea of title itself, can hope to do any better? If the answer is anything less than an unequivocal yes, the consequences will be disastrous.\nDe Soto\u2019s vision\nThe idea of registering title, property rights, on the Blockchain is touted as a mechanism for fostering social inclusion on a mass scale by the likes of Hernando de Soto, founder and president of the Institute for Liberty & Democracy. De Soto\u2019s vision is that by giving people a legal claim over their residence, they will have a viable avenue through which they might participate to a greater degree in the larger global economy, for instance, by using their home as collateral in a loan application.\nBlockchain boasts a consensus mechanism that makes its application in this domain seem very appealing. On one hand, a corrupt government official is likely to allocate property capriciously. However, in a local community, for example in the Brazilian favelas, the local residents should in theory be able to determine democratically who lives where, and based on this majority opinion, aid in establishing a legal claim of ownership. Thus, shanties that have served as individual homes for years and have clear de facto proprietors, but have had no official, viz. governmental, de jure recognition could give their residents immutable claims to ownership.\nTitle registry in the hands of this newly minted property class has the potential to afford access to vast stores of global capital hitherto unavailable to them, since they had no property to use as collateral. This has the potential to spawn new and previously unimagined economic growth, or conversely to wreak havoc.\nIn the\u00a0Republic of Georgia, efforts by De Soto in conjunction with BitFury and Georgia\u2019s National Agency of Public Registry (NAPR) are currently implementing a platform for Bockchain-based title registration. Papuna Ugrekhelidze, chairman of the NAPR, remarked in a public statement that \u201cby building a Blockchain-based property registry and taking full advantage of the security provided by the Blockchain technology, the Republic of Georgia can show the world that we are a modern, transparent and corruption-free country that can lead the world in changing the way land titling is done and pave the way to additional prosperity for all.\u201d\nStudents of history should be aware of the fact that this is not the first time a wave of mass privatization has swept post-soviet countries. Beginning in 1989, a large-scale privatization of formerly state-owned enterprises resulted in the highly inequitable economic topologies of former USSR territories.\nOne particularly acute example is the case of MM\u041c, a Russian \u201ccompany\u201d that in the 1990s executed what has been called one of the largest Ponzi schemes of all time, defrauding as many as 40 million people to the tune of $10 bln. The case of MMM did not involve title-registration but can be thought of as an historical analogy to illustrate the danger of what might happen when people come into possession of complicated assets that they neither fully appreciate nor comprehend.\nPrivatization across the crumbling socialist republics often took the form of vouchers, exchangeable for partial ownership of large hitherto state-run institutions, distributed amongst local populations, in places such as the current Republic of Georgia. Scam artists at MMM proved highly adept at convincing unsuspecting proprietors to part with their new and complicated assets for the equivalent of peanuts. \u00a0\nBitnation\u2019s Experiment in Land Registry\nIn the 2008 film Che, Ernesto Guevara states that \u201ca country that doesn\u2019t know how to read and write is easy to deceive.\u201d In the current situation we are likewise talking about literacy, private property literacy and Blockchain technology literacy. Educating people in these disciplines will be hard work, but it\u2019s nothing that blockchain registry proponents should shy away from; rather, these should become focal points of any efforts going forward. \u00a0", "birthday": "2016-10-28T11:56:00+01:00", "date": "2016-10-28 10:56:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 28}

Banks complained that their customer\u2019s cards were being fraudulently used in China and USA and feared that there had been a compromise of card data.\nThe three big payments processors in India, Mastercard, Visa and RuPay starting collaborating on this issue in September 2016. Investigations revealed that frauds were due to a possible compromise at a payment switch provider\u2019s system.\nFurther analysis revealed the possible card numbers that may have been compromised. RuPay card holders have not complained, but as of now it is not possible to use a RuPay card outside of India.\nNPCI states that fraudulent withdrawals are limited to cards of 19 banks and possibly 641 customers and the total amount involved is Rs.13 mln.\nNPCI Initiates action\nAffected banks have been informed that 3.2 mln cards could have been affected. It is suspected that the compromise is of a PCI-DSS certified switch and the PCI council has been convinced to carry out a forensic audit of the switch of one particular bank, which is suspected to be the point of compromise.\nA further action of instruction individual bank customers to change their debit card PIN numbers has been initiated. In cases where banks are unable to reach out to customers, cards are being blocked and reissued.\nState Bank alone is likely to reissue 625,000 cards.

Even Bill Gates said, if he had to do it all over again, he would go the route of network marketing - so, that is just to put a lid on those in the cryptocurrency space bad-mouthing network marketing! When you couple cryptocurrency (a legitimate one) with network marketing (a legitimate company with a sustainable compensation plan), it is ultra savvy, sophisticated, smart and lucrative, and nothing at all to criticize, as so many like to do ostentatiously!\nAnyway, I bumped into a group walking out of a meeting room at the Coral Deira Hotel in Dubai, while reserving a room for the Publisher of Las Vegas Hollywood Magazine. I've been a Columnist and Writer for the mag over the years; and we just put out a Dubai Edition, where I did A Snapshot History of Dubai, expounding upon the brilliant trade vision the late great Sheikh Rashid had and implemented for Dubai out of nothing but sand! He exemplified true leadership and created a breathtaking masterpiece of an emirate. However, as fate would have it, I bumped into this motley crew of mafiozi in that very Dubai, coming out of their meeting room, and that was the beginning of the end for OneCoin!\n I asked: \u201cNetwork marketing?\u201d and Romeo responded: \u201cCryptocurrency!\u201d \u00a0I jumped! \nAs an economist, I knew this to be the future in money and banking, so, immediately I invited them to my table at the hotel restaurant, where I just ordered dinner for myself so I could learn more about the opportunity! I went through Romeo's powerpoint presentation, speed reading my way through it, highly interested in the concept of a cryptocurrency business opportunity! Since Richard invited me to do the presentation the next week, without even having attended one! No problem for me! I started diligently researching cryptocurrencies around the clock till dawn, to prepare my presentation! For me, I saw clearly, cryptocurrencies represented freedom for God's People, and \u00a0the largest transference of wealth in history, according to Biblical Prophecy: \u201cThe wealth of the wicked is stored up for the righteous\u201d (Prov 13, 22), I envisioned this very clearly. Only thing is, it sure wouldn't be via OneCoin... But I would very soon discover that out for myself!\nThe first month, I spoke each week on the power of cryptocurrencies and did basic training on network marketing as it all seemed convoluted to me the OneCoin business model, which sounded more like some slot machine games: \u201cDouble your tokens - Double Your Coins, Double Your Power to Ching-a-Ching-Ching!\u201d Just nonsense-talk, really! There is no real business terminology, foundational concepts or rhyme and reason to the OneCoin madness! Yet people get all worked up about it as though they would become millionaires within 9-12 months, easy-peasy, as they say here in London, or within 2 years when they go public! The promises were egregious and unfounded... And all the while, the goal posts kept shifting! It all sounded very unconvincing! So, finally, the second (and last) month, I began to delve into the OneCoin business model to try and make heads or tails out of this nonsense, dissecting slide by slide, as I perfected the powerpoint presentation. I went through each slide, researching every iota of what was stated to ensure everything was based on the truth and hard core evidence before I would begin to promote this to my prospects. When lo and behold, I realized \u00a0everything was a bald-faced lie!\nI had already organized, through a Leadership Training Week in Dubai the end of that second and final month I was with them (April-end, 2016), and had \u00a0invited some key players. I was going to work with them, and send them back to launch their respective countries so we could take OneCoin worldwide... That was the initial plan.... However, that fateful week everything became crystal clear, and I pulled the plug on us doing the business, informing my leaders we would not be doing it after all, as OneCoin was nothing but a mega-scam, it was clear!\n That crucial week, I realized it was the mob running the whole thing, and in essence, was the largest global ponzi scheme in the history of the world! Bernie Madoff's scheme in New York ran in the States; but this one was worldwide, with 2.5 mln members! \nI immediately warned everyone in the Dubai Team not to do any more biz opp meetings as we were being put out on the front line to bring in money for what I call the 'Anti-Leaders,' and our lives were being jeopardized, as a result! In no wise, could this be a legitimate or legal business! Everything was off! \u00a0Everything was squirrelly! Everything reeked of bad business sense, was totally unconvincing; the proper elements were not present neither on the business side nor on the technology side of it! This was a recipe for sheer disaster! So, overnight, I became the #1 persona non grata, and all those I considered my friends in the Dubai Team turned into my enemies in a veritable heartbeat! They revealed themselves that they were nothing but low-life scammers, fraudsters, crooks and liars, and had no qualms whatsoever to scam others for money, as long as they were making money! This became crystal clear! Richard Carvalho, the low-life Indian scammer and mafiozi gatekeeper, hacker and spy, who was chosen to organize the events, and oust clear-thinking intellectuals and dissenters, such as myself, said it clearly and will say it again: \u201cWe don't care how long it will last; we will milk it till it goes down!\u201d This was not my crowd, not my society, not my cup of tea! I drew the line in the sand and was out after 2 months when this became abundantly clear that this was nothing but a huge worldwide scam with only low-life fraudsters and mafiozi running it! I immediately apologized to anyone online who had ever bad-mouthed OneCoin before me, like OzDelphi and Oz from BehindMLM, Ethan Vanderbuilt, (my post was made 5 months ago, beginning with the handle and words CharismaOneCoin: \u201cOk, ETHAN! I need to SERIOUSLY APOLOGIZE to you! You know... I have on this thread fought you tooth and nail, thinking you were not justified in your claims...\u201d) and whoever else declared it was a scam before I discovered the truth for myself!\nYou see, I just automatically assumed Ruja Ignatova was similar to myself... I assumed she, too, was an Orthodox Christian - as I am Serbian Orthodox, even though I was born in Canada. I always fought for the little guys as I deeply care about people, so, I just assumed she did too! Boy, was I wrong!... She takes maximum advantage of unsuspecting victims, and those who don't have money to put up! I thought she was fighting international banksters, like me! I am savvy in the backstage politics of shadow world powers, and studied political management in Washington D.C., so, I am no rookie on that front, and am well known to illuminati elitists, who have tried to recruit me a long time now, but I am an avid Christian leader, and want no part of that sinister mob! So, naturally, I was going to rush to her rescue, as I have huge experience fighting these powers and principalities, and just thought she was fighting them to help God's People! This was naive thinking, and I couldn't have been further from the mark! Ruja Ignatova is the Wicked Witch of the Balkans, and totally unscrupulous!\nSo, as a veteran and leader in the industry, I know the elements that need to be in place for a network marketing business to be legitimate and a comp plan sustainable; yet none of these elements were in place! They were all lacking, and the whole opportunity smelled bad... very bad! I have my experience there too, so I recognized this quickly! I saw it was about to explode in everyone's faces! And the fact that they dared use me to promote them necessitated that I needed to expose them, as I would never willingly steer anyone in the wrong direction! I have zero tolerance for shysters, con-artists and fraudsters, and these were the worst of the worst I came across! I watch my soul above all else, so earning money is not my prime objective in life! It must be in line with Christian living, God's righteousness, or I am not at all interested; so now, I needed to expose them, as I have a circle of influence, and people believe me when I speak, as I speak the God-honest truth!", "birthday": "2016-10-23T13:55:00+01:00", "date": "2016-10-23 12:55:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 23}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-bitcoin-debit-cards-is-a-small-but-promising-industry-sector", "title": " Why Bitcoin Debit Cards is a Small, But Promising Industry Sector ", "content": "Bitcoin continues to confidently make its way to mass adoption. The replication of traditional financial system elements was always an unavoidable attribute of this process; and finally, it came to debit cards.\nSomeone thinks that entering debit cards makes intuitive sense in terms of making Bitcoin spending mainstream; someone thinks of it as of temporary solution in a way to something more. We\u2019ve explored, what makes this market tick and how will it develop in the near future.\nSmall, yet impactful\nBitcoin debit card market is quite new, and there\u2019s not really much to tell about its history. It\u2019s commonly assumed that everything started in 2014 - back then, mass media talked about Xapo, the company that debuted with first Bitcoin debit card. Soon, it was no longer something unique: the niche started growing dynamically, and already in this year the segment became diversified enough to offer the opportunity to choose among many various solutions. Today, more than 20 companies provide Bitcoin debit card services for tens of thousands cardholders across the world.\u00a0\nThe launch of an owned Bitcoin debit card was also the initial idea of UK-based financial solutions provider Spectro Finance. The company came up with this idea probably earlier than anyone else in the market, in 2013.\u00a0\nHowever, the first two years of the company\u2019s activity were dedicated to something different: implementing two separate projects. The first of them is Spectro Coin, a Bitcoin exchange with a Blockchain-based wallet and risk-free merchant solution: the exchange service which allows integrating Bitcoin in any business with 25 000 EUR no-fee limits. The second one is SpectroCard - a virtual Mastercard-based prepaid card, which is claimed to be one of the most flexible and cheapest payment card solutions for European market.\nSpectro \u0421oin debit card was introduced two years later, in early 2015; by now, the company managed to issue more than 20,000 cards for more than 120 countries. Being quite a flexible solution, the card is accepted anywhere where Visa and Mastercard are supported; so, users can withdraw and spend their funds in millions of ATMs, websites and shops across the globe. Besides of Bitcoin, SpectroCoin card provides support of dollars, euros, and pounds; also, one of key advantages of the card is instant funding, so owners don\u2019t have to exchange Bitcoins in advance.\nPrivacy is not an option\nEven though Bitcoin debit cards is the best solution for direct Bitcoin spending so far, nobody tells it\u2019s an ideal one, there are some substantial disadvantages.\nAnonymity have always been one of the most important Bitcoin features. That\u2019s why it may seem paradoxical that the situation with Bitcoin debit cards is opposite: absolute privacy is simply impossible here.\n\u201cAs long as debit cards - Bitcoin or otherwise - are connected to long-term players in the market, such as Visa or MasterCard, anonymity is not 100% possible,\u201d states Anni Rautio, Product Manager at Xapo and the Head of Xapo Debit Card.\nIndeed, most of the service providers in USA and Europe will require a whole set of documents, among which are an ID card, social security number, driver license, and some other documents.\u00a0\nSpectroCoin, however, offers a middle-ground approach: the company allows cardholders to stay incognito under $2500 funds turnover. It\u2019s worth noting that limit is enough for a number of users to stay anonymous for entire card lifetime. And if card owner needs higher financial limit, ID card and utility bills will be everything that required of him to get verified access.\nIt is noteworthy that not all market players see the problem in the prevailing situation:\n\u201cLack of privacy is not necessarily a problem, as non-anonymous cards enable stronger fraud controls and consumer protection. I'd say the balance between anonymity or privacy to certain extent and convenience is providing personal information. Some people prefer convenience over anonymity, others prefer anonymity over convenience\", says\u00a0Anni Rautio, Head of Xapo Debit Card.\nAssociated expenses\nAnother disadvantage of Bitcoin debit cards are prices and additional fees. In average, users have to pay $15 for a physical card and about $3 for its virtual analog and then, in some cases, add around $60 for express delivery. Spending doesn\u2019t stop there, though: there are also fees for domestic ($2,50) and international ($3,50) ATM withdrawal. At the same time, international transactions fee is something around 3%. Card service is one more item of expenditure: it includes monthly/annual service ($1 and $12 respectively), PIN change (~$1), card replacement (~ $12), etc.\nIt\u2019s not a secret that nobody likes to overpay, and given how small this market is, pricing policy can play a significant role for the competitiveness of the service. Realizing this, many companies seek to meet some kind of balance and offer the most democratic solution. SpectroCoin is no exception to this. The prices of both virtual and physical cards are significantly lower than the market average ($0,5/$9 against $3/$15). As for loading fee, SpectroCoin doesn\u2019t take any, it also offers lower exchange rate.\nInconveniency\nBesides the major issues, there are also other, interrelated problems. Mainly, they are relevant to Bitcoin itself. One of them is that even after 7 years of its existence, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t still receive a wider adoption.\nAnni Rautio, Head of Xapo Debit Card:\n \u201cLarge scale adoption of Bitcoin is still far away, and very few merchants (and practically no banks) accept Bitcoins yet. Bitcoin and the Bitcoin debit card markets are still not at all mature, so the industry as a whole has a long path to go.\u201d \nSpeaking of the problems of Bitcoin debit cards themselves, Vytautas Karalevicius, co-founder and CEO of Spectro Finance, shared his own vision:\n\u201cThe major problem is inconvenience. People now have to load their card before using it to purchase or withdraw money at ATM.\u201d", "birthday": "2016-10-19T15:25:00+01:00", "date": "2016-10-19 14:25:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 19}

The simplistic idea behind crowdfunding a non-existent software or system has become a trend in the cryptocurrency industry, with private companies raising millions of dollars to fund their next operations.\nCrowdfunding vs ICO\nOne major difference exists between traditional crowdfunding methods and ICO, and that is market value. When a product is introduced on crowdfunding platforms like Indiegogo, investors and buyers are aware exactly what to expect when the product is complete.\nFor instance, when electric skateboard Boosted Board or smart watch Pebble initiated their crowdfunding campaigns, investors were able to immediately tell if the product was worth a certain amount of money by comparing the products to others in the market.\nIn contrast, it is virtually impossible to predict the outcome of an ICO, especially if users aren\u2019t fully aware what they can expect. ICO itself is not based on any real-world market value, which thus makes it prone to substantial under or overvaluation of assets.\nUsually, Blockchain startups themselves provide a value to the tokens being sold in an ICO. So, a startup sets the initial value that isn\u2019t based on any value, product or software.\nThus, what happens when a token is overvalued? Investors lose substantial amount of money.

It is estimated that by the end of this decade that 80 percent of the continent\u2019s more than 1.2 bln population would be using Smartphones.\nThen what hinders Bitcoin penetration in Africa? Cointelegraph spoke about it with experts in the cryptocurrency community on the so-called dark continent.\nFear of change\nScrutinizing the bottlenecks to penetration, Andrew Tudhope, Bitnation Ambassador of South Africa noted that access to, and interest in, complicated technologies, especially software is the bane. \u201cWho really cares what form one's money takes when one has none?\u201d He asked emphatically.\nHowever, Alakanani \u2018Motherpky\u2019 Itireleng who is the Director of the Satoshi Centre in Gaborone, Botswana, thinks it is associated with unconsciousness. She thinks the fear of change and being comfortable with the status coalesce with Africans unwillingness to educate themselves accounts for the current state of the digital currency in Africa.\nJohn Karanga of BitHub.Africa seems to agree with both Andrew and Alakanani on their various Views. The Kenyan Crypto enthusiast noted:\n \u201cThe main hindrance to adoption of Bitcoin technology, which we do not often talk about, is the lack of awareness and skills to adopt the technology. Bitcoin currently is a sophisticated technology compared to the simplicity of existing platforms like M-Pesa, which my grandmother who does not even speak English can use. The Bitcoin technology needs to get simpler or integrate into other simpler platforms. We also need to get better at educating Africans about this technology.\u201d \nExploring smartphones\nInterestingly, there are differing opinions from the three African Cryptocurrency advocates on how pervasiveness of smartphones in Africa can speed adoption. Alakanani believes many Africans are not in the known on the power their smartphones wield.\n\u201cWhat I have realised is most people buy smartphones for prestige and hardly explore the ability these phones have. People often use their phones for calls, SMS and downloading games and music. If people receive the education and are shown how to use these gadgets, maybe we might see adoption,\u201d Alakanani pointed out.\nPolitical change\nFrom the standpoint of view of Andrew it\u2019s partially not the case. According to the Senior Citizen two factors among a few accounts for his observation. He sums it up here:\n \u201cNot necessarily, as the situation in Kenya and the recent fuss around BitPesa proves. Obviously, the more people online with smartphones, the better it is for internet-based things (and this goes doubly for money native to the net), but there are a number of factors at work. First, data costs on the African continent remain some of the highest in the world. Second, it remains essentially impossible to run a full node from your phone, and certainly not over mobile networks. While adoption need not require people running full nodes, it means once again being forced into the position of consumers rather than co-creators. Again, I think it is more likely that Bitcoin, and the technological innovations it represents, will form the foundations on which significant social and political changes will take place, and it is not just the smartphones, but the Africans who are using them are the most interesting part of the peer-to-peer equation.\u201d \nThe CEO of BitHub.Africa slighly agrees with Andrew particularly with internet connectivity and how it is expensive. John\u2019s position was that \u201cYes, the fast adoption of smartphones across some African countries e.g. Kenya is very encouraging. It means people are connecting to the Internet at an unprecedented rate, allowing them to access more opportunities previously inaccessible to them. Bitcoin just adds fuel to the fire and allows them to transact freely across the globe. Think about Africans living in the diaspora for example, they can now send money directly to their relatives, invest, and therefore contribute to the economies of their respective countries. This is possible through mobile connectivity.\u201d\nHowever, the Eastern African also thinks all is not rosy. \u201cThere are a few challenges remaining like the cost of Internet data and the quality of the smartphones but more importantly, we can also see the shift to a mobile digital economy happening.\u201d\nTerrorism accusations\nIn recent times the Kenyan government has been clamping down Bitcoin citing the use of Bitcoin by terrorist as the rationale behind the onslaught.

After over a quarter of a million downloads (I was one of them) and thousands of new store ideas taking over a decentralized, user-powered digital space, it is time for a second refresh, months in the making.\nOn Thursday, the group behind OpenBazaar known as OB1 released information on a new program they have developed called \u2018Deploy,\u2019 along with a long-awaited program update. Let\u2019s start with the new \u2018Deploy\u2019 program first.\nAre you ready to Deploy?\nI know I am. Building an OpenBazaar store, at launch, six months ago was cool and all, but up to this point the store was only operational if my computer was online to power it. Since my computer isn\u2019t on 24/7, it goes into sleep modes, and I don\u2019t always open the app, it leads to a very non-committal way of doing decentralized business.\nYour standard website or email campaign works whether you are on your computer or not, with no batteries required. It's a better system, and more functional for everyone involved. It seems that OB1 sees it the same way, as they have released Deploy to fill in these gaps. It appears this is for new users or store builders, and won\u2019t work with current stores. Honestly, this makes me want to get started with a new store all over again.\nDeploy makes your OpenBazaar store as convenient to operate as any website online. Deploy allows you to create and operate your new OpenBazaar store no matter what condition your computer is in, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It will auto-update for you and govern your security as well. There are people who cannot handle servers all day, nor keep an open line, and Deploy fills in this space with its open-source code.\n\u201cThe real solution to this problem is OpenBazaar 2.0, which uses IPFS to distribute store data between peers so that your store is available 24/7 even if you\u2019re offline,\u201d said co-founder Washington Sanchez. \u201cBut until this is released, we want to help anyone create a permanently online store, whatever your skill level is.\u201d\n", "birthday": "2016-10-21T10:40:00+01:00", "date": "2016-10-21 09:40:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 21}

Ether\u2019s price is fortifying at a key technical level of $11.5. Most bulls see that mark as the peak of a correction toward the upward trend which has started at $8. That\u2019s why the price has stopped falling and remains near that level. However, the resulting flat indicates that there is a counterforce from the bears. The resulting balance between the bears and the bulls may result in an ultimate continuation of the decline.\n\nThe fact that the level of $11.5 is perceived by most bulls as the peak of a correction is also confirmed by a large volume of buy orders in that area, as well as by the growth of volatility. According to the Poloniex exchange, the number of buy orders at the bottom limit of the flat at $11.5 is almost twice as high as the number of sell orders at the top limit, near $12.\nSo far there seems to be more support for the upward trend, than for a downward one. As we can see from the volume, most traders expect a continuation of growth.\nEverything depends on the upcoming reaction of the price at the limits of the flat: $11.5 - $12.

For a more confident upward movement, we need to see the formation of a turning wave at that mark.\n\nThe upper limit of the flat at $12 is the minimal peak of a correction towards the downward movement which has started at $14.5. That is confirmed by the diagonal channel and the accumulated sell order volume at that mark. If the price reaches the diagonal channel, it will complete the downward structure which began forming at $14.5. That way, there will be a chance for a larger-scale trend to form.

As challenging as it sounds, he managed to visit 50 cities in 27 countries. His experience also made me think about how such a trip would look like in my hometown, Budapest.\nAs popular as Bitcoin has been recently, its widespread use in everyday life in Hungary is still a bit farther away. Despite the fact that our neighbours - Austria and Slovakia are ahead of us in terms of products and services that could be bought with Bitcoin, there are still quite a few businesses in Hungary which accept payments in Bitcoins.\nSo, if you were determined to organize such a short Bitcoin getaway to Budapest, don\u2019t give up on it just yet. Here are a few tips how to spend time in Budapest only paying with Bitcoin.\nTravel to Budapest and within the city\nPurchasing a flight ticket with Bitcoin is quite simple with CheapAir being the most well-known website for flight reservations in the Bitcoin world. Booking a flight with them only takes a few minutes, and your trip to Budapest is already underway.\nWhen you land at Liszt Ferenc International Airport, the fastest way to get to the city centre is by taxi. In February 2016, the first taxi company in this aspect, Budapest Taxi introduced Bitcoin payments to their passengers.\nNo need to worry about exchanging currencies with high fees at the airport, just order a taxi and enjoy the ride. Bitcoin payments are facilitated by CoinPay, and ensure that you are charged the correct amount as you receive a proof of payment in form of a print receipt, e-mail, or text message.\nAccommodation\nThe first and currently still the only hotel in Hungary to offer payment with Bitcoin is Paprika Hostel, located in the city center.\nAnother establishment listed as accepting Bitcoins is a lakeside apartment in Tata, some 100 km away from the capital. The upside is that you are able to make a direct reservation with these properties.\nHowever, if you are looking for a wider range of options, Expedia will be your ultimate guide. Listing more than 400 hotels in Budapest, everyone can find their ideal place to stay in the city.\nRestaurants and bars\nBudapest has plenty of famous restaurants, not to mention the so-called \u2018ruin pubs\u2019 which have become a must-see for visitors. As of now, Bitcoin payments are only possible in few of them. After a tiring day of sightseeing, HQ Caf\u00e9 in the 7th district is your (possibly only) chance for a Bitcoin-paid coffee and dessert.\nKlub Anker and AnKER\u2019T (a beer garden, ideal for summer visitors), both located in the city centre (6th district) are the most well-known for accepting Bitcoin payments.\nIf you decide to spend a night out in the city, chances are that you will be in the vicinity of De\u00e1k Ferenc square so you can easily check out these two bars.\nBitcoin ATMs in Budapest\nIf you decide that there isn\u2019t enough variety of Bitcoin accepting places, there is always the possibility to visit a Bitcoin ATM and withdraw some Hungarian Forints from your Bitcoin wallet. Currently, there are two options to do that: at Klub Anker or at Stop Shop Mall\u00a0(3rd district).", "birthday": "2016-10-18T09:52:00+01:00", "date": "2016-10-18 08:52:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 18}

Martijn Wismeijer, representative of General Bytes, the manufacturer of the machine, tells us about\u00a0manufacturing Bitcoin ATMs, 3D printing process and future collaborations.\nWismeijer says:\n \"By standardizing on our own Bitcoin computer we can rapidly create new applications using the tools we already have. We like to see it as LEGO for Bitcoin applications.\" \nManufacturing Bitcoin ATMs\nThe Red Bull\u2019s Bitcoin-only vending machine was originally manufactured by the Red Bull development team in Thailand. Upon its completion, the machine was sent to a Bitcoin ATM manufacturer - General Bytes and Prague-based 3D printing company Makers Lab for additional modification.\n\nEssentially, Red Bull required the\u00a0integration of a Bitcoin payment system\u00a0that would allow the vending machine to accept digital currency payments via contactless NFC payment method. With focus set on user experience and flexibility, General Bytes hoped to make Bitcoin transactions easier than cash.\n\u201cUsers do not need to know anything about Bitcoin or crypto to get a can of RedBull. Instead, they just have to swipe their wallet card. \u201cWe wanted to streamline the purchase process and make it easier to use than cash,\u201d explained General Bytes marketing manager Martijn Wismeijer.\nTo do this, the General Bytes team first removed the cash acceptor on the original Red Bull vending machine, which took up a significant amount of internal space. Considering the difficulty of creating custom fit replacement cover manually, General Bytes partnered with Makerslab to 3D print the cover for the Bitcoin acceptor with necessary modification for various compartments.\n\n\u201cRemoving the cash acceptor left us with this huge hole in the vending machine so the designers at Makerslab created a 3D-printed replacement cover for the coin acceptor with mounting holes for status LEDs and NFC wallet reader,\u201d Wismeijer added.\nRed Bull and General Bytes believed that both the manufacturing process and distribution of the Red Bull Bitcoin vending machine came to life because programmers, hardware hackers, 3D makers and artists came together to create the one and only Red Bull signature Bitcoin vending machine.", "birthday": "2016-10-14T14:40:00+01:00", "date": "2016-10-14 13:40:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 14}

The platform that started from Bitcoin trading operations has evolved more and more into a traditional bank with Blockchain benefits added as a layer on the top. As their biggest concern seems to be about customers feeling more secure and at ease with digital money, they are currently introducing a new type of safe wallet with multi-signature hardware.\nThe access to this wallet is similar to a bank\u2019s deposit box: the client can be sure that no one else except him or her is able to get hold of the funds. In order to make any kind of operation two keys are needed to be used - one retained by the customer and the other by the bank. Without a user key no external party is able to compromise its security.\nThe bank is also planning to offer loans to customers as well in case the client experiences shortage of funds for developing businesses, personal money needs, unforeseen expenditure and urgency funding. Safe cryptocurrency wallet can be used as a guarantee for a credit line in fiat currency without any exchange.\nBoesing concludes that through these two initiatives (Safe wallet and lending possibilities) they are building Coinsbank into a personalized bank on the Blockchain. In other expected future developments, Coinsbank is working to add Live Support product functionality as well as corporate solutions.\nQIWI: Enable consumers and merchants to use and accept electronic payments\nOne of the speakers at Coinsbank Blockchain, leading provider of next generation payment services in Russia and the CIS QIWI suggests\u00a0that the best way to break the entry barriers to digital money should be by enabling relevant payment services across physical, online and mobile channels.\nThe company has already deployed over 16.2 mln virtual wallets, over 164,000 kiosks and terminals, and enabled merchants to accept over RUB 67 bln cash and electronic payments monthly from over 60 mln consumers using its network at least once a month.\u00a0", "birthday": "2016-10-14T16:27:00+01:00", "date": "2016-10-14 15:27:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 14}

The reasons were multi fold. One is that the prices are incredibly low. A dollar can buy you nearly 6-7 pastries at a local bakery. Secondly there are no coins, this means that whilst you pay in the dollar, you get your change back in Cambodian Riels. It seems to be a common knowledge that 1 dollar is nearabouts 4000 Riels. While at first getting your change back and doing the math maybe perplexing, you can get used to it. In most non-touristy shops the prices are marked in Cambodian Riels. Divide by 4000 and you can pay in dollars or you can simply shell out the Riel. Of course at the ATM, you can get either Riels or dollars but most ATMs simply spew out dollars. A big problem though remains getting change for bigger dollar bills. If you carry around 100s that you have freshly withdrawn from an ATM, you will struggle a lot.\nHow they have blown up the Central Bank\nCambodia maybe the only country in the world with the dubious distinction of the blowing up of the national bank. I am sure that many readers would love the idea that national banks just disappear. Well it has actually occurred there. The Banque Nationale du Cambodge or The National Bank of Cambodia was established in 1954 and started printing the Riel to end the monetary alliance between Vietnam and Laos. However, the bank met a grisly end in 1975, when it was blown up with explosives by the infamous Khmer Rouge. Their symbolic destruction of the national bank also put an end to the use of the Riel as a currency. When the Khmer Rouge were driven out by Vietnam, the Riel was reintroduced and a central bank reformulated from scratch. It was only after the UN came in and ran the country for a while in the 1990s that the reintroduced Riel lost its market value as oodles of dollars made their way into Cambodia.\nMany currencies, one country", "birthday": "2016-10-16T12:54:00+01:00", "date": "2016-10-16 11:54:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 16}

Fintech players across the globe are looking more into Blockchain technology and digital currencies.\nThe scope of development however varies across the regions. While in some regions potential applications are in their infancy, in other parts of the world the application of technology is getting closer for wider implementation.\nCointelegraph spoke to Stelian Balta\u00a0and\u00a0Arai Ezzra\u00a0from\u00a0DinarDirham\u00a0on what contributes to development of cryptocurrency business.\nBalta explains:\n \u201cThe major issue for mass adoption of digital currencies is volatility.\u201d \nBacking Gold trading with Blockchain\nDinarDirham is a global Fintech company represented in Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, and soon in Dubai, which provides Gold and Forex investment solutions worldwide. DinarDirham team has developed a range of services and products which include DinarCoin, DinarDirham wallet, and upcoming DinarDirham debit card.\n\u201cWith DinarCoin, we solved the volatility problem,\u201d says Balta. \u201cUsers can now buy digital currency knowing that it will follow the gold price. It\u2019s stable and safe. DinarCoin is backed by the global gold spot price, compared to other digital currencies with prices based on supply and demand, such as Bitcoin. Our mission is to offer financial stability and reliable services.\u201d\nAnother service offered by the company, DinarDirham Wallet, is Blockchain based platform for exchanging, trading or storing digital assets. As Balta said, soon it will become possible to withdraw digital assets from the wallet directly by using the DinarDirham debit card. Company is currently working on the implementation of this new solution.\nAsian Fintech boom\nAsia certainly has a competitive edge in Blockchain tech. Fintech startups across Asia raised $2.6 bln in funding only in the first quarter of 2016. Fintech investments in Asia-Pacific have skyrocketed in 2015 \u2014 from about $880 mln in all of 2014 to nearly $3.5 bln in just the first nine months of 2015 (research by Accenture).\n\u201cThe interest in cryptocurrencies is overwhelming, because people are more open towards this kind of financial technology,\u201d says Arai Ezzra. \u201cSouth East Asia is a \u201cmobile first\u201d region. With technology tools being more accessible, everyone is beginning to see the huge impact and disruption that\u2019s happening across the industry. There are plenty of digital currency ATM and ATVM machines in several countries around Asia, for example in Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia. I think Blockchain technology will be an important technology in finance and banking in the years to come.\u201d\n\n-\u00a0Arai Ezzra from DinarDirham\nThe interest of the community in this technology in the region is also visible through wider merchant account integrations and payment gateways using digital currencies. What are the reasons of such a positive trend? The road from concept to implementation might be long and bumpy and involve certain challenges ranging from acceptance to trust, regulation, and others.\nThe importance of favorable regulatory climate should not be underestimated. Indeed, it is impossible to grow a cryptocurrency, or a Fintech business in general, if regulators put spoke in a wheel.\n\u201cIn South East Asia, the regulatory climate for running a Blockchain business is still at an early stage, but important progress is being made,\u201d says Arai Ezzra. \u201cSome countries, for example Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, and also Malaysia are starting to be more inclined to fostering innovation, especially in the area of Fintech. That\u2019s why Singapore and Malaysia have created Sandbox programs in order to move the industry forward.\u201d\nPerhaps the most important factor that contributes to the development of cryptocurrency business is the effect of the network itself. As Arai Ezzra explained, any given currency gains use value as the number of its users increases, therefore, popularity of a certain currency is integral in that currency's success. This leads us to one of the major obstacles that cryptocurrency has to deal with which is based on the users\u2019 knowledge of the cryptocurrency.", "birthday": "2016-10-17T13:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-10-17 12:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 17}

He is making significant progress on his MegaUpload2/BitCache program, calling it not just a site or application but a \u201cmovement.\u201d Cointelegraph gives you the latest progress report on the future mainstream website application that Kim Dotcom believes will single-handedly change Bitcoin forever.\nIs Bitcoin ready for the mainstream?\nMany in the Bitcoin community worry about Bitcoin\u2019s ability to crossover into the mainstream, if it will ever happen, and can the protocol handle the transaction flow. Kim Dotcom says his new BitCache is a lock to take Bitcoin to new heights, at least based on his track record, mailing list, which he says numbers 200 mln MegaUpload Version One users, and innovative design.\n\n\u00a0- Image provided by MegaUpload2/BnkToTheFuture\nBitCache is designed to make online file sharing and microtransactions for those files on the next Bitcoin mainstream application for 2017, if not sooner. Since the Bitcoin Blockchain is struggling to handle the transaction volume it presently enjoys, a new system for off-chain Bitcoin transactions need to be constructed, and Kim Dotcom calls it BitCache.\nKim says that since the Blockchain cannot handle the Bitcoin business, his project will deliver, this is a necessity. Mlns of microtransactions will be handled off-chain, at an average or default transaction cost of $0.05, something currently impossible with legacy merchant banking tools available to the average webmaster.\nEach user should be able to have a natural level of protection in the fact that their total account balance would be only a few dollars, not attracting a hack attack into their account. The funds would be re-introduced to the Bitcoin Blockchain when the user is ready to cash out, or anytime at the user\u2019s discretion.\n\u201cI want to take Bitcoin mainstream,\u201d Kim Dotcom told Max Keiser on The Keiser Report. \u201cIn order to do that, we need to have a really powerful, popular site that can carry Bitcoin to the next level, and I believe that MegaUpload2 can be that site. I believe at some point, we will have hundreds of mlns of users. MegaUpload is more than a business; it\u2019s a movement.\u201d\nSome may dismiss Kim Dotcom as a blowhard who is just hyping a new business venture, but his track record does give him credibility. His original MegaUpload was valued at $2.4 bln before the U.S. Government took down the site. Kim says he was doing detailed valuations at the time because he was six months from going public through an IPO at the time.\nHis current fundraising effort on BnkToTheFuture for MegaUpload2/BitCache is also going along well, reaching the halfway point to its $1 mln minimum target, paid so far exclusively by investors in Bitcoin. Kim had required investors to use Bitcoin exclusively in deference to the pivotal nature of the decentralized digital currency. On Tuesday, they began allowing bank wire transfers to ease the process for those well-funded but unable to quickly or easily gain Bitcoins due to having no experience in the space. The pitch will take Bitcoin and bank transfer donations through October 24th.\n \u201cIt's about more than sharing files. It\u2019s about Internet freedom. It's about technology providing us with our basic human rights that the laws aren\u2019t protecting anymore. We are using technology to make sure that users can interact privately, that their files are not intercepted and spied on, and it's happening with Bitcoin.

This invention, in theory, will change the world and could destroy Bitcoin within a matter of minutes.\nQuantum leap for computing power\nThe current generation of computing runs on bits of information that are represented by one and zeros. These bits represent the first generation of mass computing and we may be coming to the end of the first, with Quantum computing representing Version 2.0.\nQuantum computing is a theory begun in 1982 by the physicist Richard Feynman. Quantum computers run on \u201cqubits\u201d which can be in two states at once over a simple, single binary state. This versatility allows the system to become exponentially more powerful than today\u2019s computer, at least for certain tasks and situations. Sometimes, it is only slightly superior. In other tasks, it is a quantum leap forward.\nThusly, the world\u2019s largest corporations, governments, and state-run agencies are working furiously to build this holy grail of computers. These factions include Google,\u00a0the NSA, the CIA, the nation of Canada and\u00a0the E.U\u2019s European Commission, who has invested over $1 bln euros into the project this year alone. And these just are the projects that we know about.\nThreat to Bitcoin?\nBitcoin and its cryptographic protocol, to this point, have proven too strong and resilient to be overthrown by the current level of computing power thrown at it in a world full of hackers and national empires seeking to destroy its financial independence. Yet, a targeted quantum computer attack may be above its pay grade.\nGoing back to 2008, even before Bitcoin was born, Scott Aaronson of The Scientific American has declared quantum computers as the perfect tool to destroy current digital protocols like Bitcoin, stating in his expository work called\u00a0\u201cThe Limits of Quantum\u201d:\n\u201cAccording to our current understanding, they would provide dramatic speedups for a few specific problems, such as breaking the cryptographic codes that are widely used for monetary transactions on the Internet.\u201d\nAt the time, I\u2019m sure he was referring to things like online banking, which were beginning to take hold in the mainstream, and not speaking about decentralized currencies, in particular. Would quantum computers mean your online banking, and all other encrypted apps and programs, would also become null and void regarding security? Other quantum experts of the present day are in agreement that quantum is the answer to Bitcoin\u2019s cryptographic security question.\n\u201cBitcoin is definitely not quantum computer proof,\u201d Andersen Cheng, co-founder of U.K. cybersecurity firm Post Quantum, told\u00a0Newsweek. \u201cBitcoin will expire the very day the first Quantum computer appears.\u201d\nThis seems like a hyperbole, considering if you have world\u2019s first quantum computer you probably have more important things to do with it than to steal all of the world\u2019s Bitcoins. If that was the point, that is one hell of a compliment to Bitcoin that its destruction is number one on the To-Do list, but the point is made.\nHow would a quantum computer unravel Bitcoin\u2019s protection?\nAs we all know,\u00a0Bitcoin runs on a public key, which is like an email address to receive payments, and a private key that protects the account and proves ownership of these digital coins.", "birthday": "2016-10-13T16:55:00+01:00", "date": "2016-10-13 15:55:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 13}

The Bitcoin operation started when John McAfee, creator of McAfee Antivirus, took over the MGT earlier this year and has steered the company into Bitcoin and Blockchain technology.\nMarco Streng, CEO of Genesis Mining, spoke to Cointelegraph about MGT\u2019s Bitcoin mining operations:\n\u201cWe appreciate the efforts of MGT going into mining and think it is good for the industry. Since 10 PHs is still a relatively small size operation the direct effect of this for the mining market is rather limited.\u201d\nHow is MGT\u2019s Bitcoin mining different?\nTo date, MGT has mined over 90 Bitcoins so far, at $611 each. At this exchange rate, MGT has earned over $50,000 in mining revenue and is continuing its mining operations. Now, MGT is beginning Phase Two of its mining plans and hopes to reach 5 PetaHash of mining power by the end of 2016\u2019s fourth quarter.\nIt is quite unusual that a company like MGT would invest in a physical Bitcoin mine rather than hold Bitcoin. Most Venture Capital firms just buy and hold Bitcoin in their portfolios but McAfee is taking a different approach.\nSince MGT is indeed using a massive amount of hardware and their low-cost hydro-power strategy, it seems that it would be more profitable to mine. However, as the reward for Bitcoin blocks mined continues to split, the facility\u2019s fate is sealed by the future Bitcoin price.\nAccording to sources, Bitcoin\u2019s next split should be in 2020. This will split the block reward down to 6.25 BTC but the smaller reward will be compensated by Bitcoin\u2019s sky-high value.", "birthday": "2016-10-09T16:35:00+01:00", "date": "2016-10-09 15:35:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 9}

It appears the company\u2019s claims are unsubstantiated. \u00a0\nCointelegraph spoke with Bruce Fenton about the situation:\nCointelegraph: A couple of days ago OneCoin claimed to have successfully switched on their new Blockchain transferring coins from the old one to the new? Ain\u2019t you impressed?\nBruce Fenton: Heh.\nCT: Looks like if anything goes wrong it\u2019s the reputation of OneCoin that\u2019s at stake here. Why are you and some members of the community Concerned?\nBF:\u00a0Because when OneCoin collapses and thousands lose their money the regulators will blame all cryptocurrencies.\nCT: Haven\u2019t they showed enough proof of the existence of their Blockchain?\nBF: Oh no \u2212 it\u2019s just a fake video they showed. Also, a Blockchain doesn\u2019t mean anything. It doesn\u2019t back the value.\nCT: Do the numbers of coins and minutes they were mined raise eyebrows?\nBF: It means nothing. And is unlikely true. I can launch a coin today and issue a billion coins. It doesn\u2019t mean they have values. Why would my coin have value? It\u2019s only worth something if people will pay. No one will pay for OneCoin. It\u2019s a scam.\nCT: Not less than 8400 people were at the launch in Thailand...\nBF: Okay but would 8400 people mean it\u2019s not a scam? Look \u2212 it\u2019s like this \u2212 Dr. Ruja just made up this idea for a cryptocurrency and gets people to give her money. That\u2019s it. If you invested I'm sorry but that money is gone. Onecoin has no value in the open market \u2212 that's why it doesn't trade.\nCT: Let's look at Onecoin\u2019s claims. What cardinal features are the so-called digital currency missing?\nBF: Well where is the Blockchain? Can I see the code? What is the tech based on? Is there a block explorer? Is it transparent? Where were the coins before and how are they issued? Where does the money go once it's given to Onecoin? How do you know the amount of coins you have?\nCT: Do we have cryptocurrency without a wallet?\nBF: Not having a wallet is also a concern.\nCT: What about Packages that requires Know Your Customer (KYO). Looks like that contradicts cryptocurrency?\nBF: I don't care much about that.. It's mainly a device for the state to track people better.\nCT: If those investing in Onecoin care to listen, do you have a message for them?\nBF: Sure, research independently. There are entire sites that focus on why this is a scam\u2026 Also learn about what Blockchain tech really is and ask what would give this any value.\nNo evidence of the real Blockchain\nThe group made up of leading technical developers, business people, adopters and investors, in a release on Github expressed their sincere and worried concerns about the illegal activities of the Cryptocurrency outfit.\nExperts say that what the company has shown on screen at the Hong kong event was actually faked.\n\u201cThere is no evidence that there really is such a Blockchain by any readable definition,\u201d the release stated.

The short-term downward trend, which has held for almost the entire week, has reached a key level. It is time for a natural upward movement.\nETH/USD\nLast Tuesday, the advantage was held by the bears. Ether\u2019s price has begun confidently forming a downward trend, never once breaking its structure. However, in order to continue its fall, the price has to break through a serious resistance line, which it has approached closely.

Judging by the nature of that rebound, we can see if the price is going to fall even deeper.\n\nThe downward movement which has started at $13.5 is just a subwave of the medium-term flat. Consequently, for a medium-term trend to begin, the price has to exit that flat. Ether\u2019s price will have to fortify at the bottom limit of that sideways movement, near $11.5, and stay below $13. The trend needs to correct towards at least the diagonal channel, in order to weed out the probability of a correction of a smaller scale. Only after that will this environment signify sufficient strength of the bears. In that case, the entire situation will give the first confirmation for a deeper fall. The bulls can show themselves near $11.5, but their volumes will be significantly lower than those of the bears. In that scenario, we will need a downward turning wave to finally confirm the power of the bears. Then, the minimal target for Ether will be below $9.

Both bears and bulls are having doubts about possible scenarios for the nearest future.\nETH/USD\nAt the moment, the entire situation on Ethereum can be characterized as 100% uncertain. For more than a week the price has been drifting around $13. Such behaviour indicates that neither bears nor bulls can find a possible trend. On the other hand, the lack of bears can be good news. Subsequently, because of that, the price is likely to fortify soon.\n\nEthereum\u2019s price is being traded between two key levels of $14.2 and $11.5.\nThe $14.2 mark is a long-term resistance line, and a point of intersection for correctional Fibonacci 50% retracement and accumulated trading volume. That mark is the most likely future peak for the correction towards the downward movement which has started at $22.\nThe opposite resistance line is the medium-term level of $11.5. That is an intersection point for the correctional Fibonacci 61.8% retracement and the accumulated volume, as well as the diagonal channel, which is responsible for the entire upward structure from $7. The $11.5 mark is the most likely peak for a correction towards the upward trend.\nThe current price of Ether is not profitable for either bulls or bears. That is confirmed by the Average True Range (ATR) indicator - the volatility is dropping. Naturally, the $13 price is still not low enough for bulls, and neither is it high enough for bears. Ether\u2019s price is inside a flat, that\u2019s why it is generally not profitable. This can go on until some significant news surface, which could provoke either large buy or sell amounts.\nThe price becomes relatively low at $11.5, given that it is the bottom limit of the flat. Conversely, a high enough point for Ether sellers is near $14, where the top limit of the flat is set. Thus, volatility is very likely to grow at the levels of $14.2 or $11.5, which should lead to a turn in either of the two directions.\nBut for a more confident signal of a turn, we need to see a fortification at one of the key levels and formation of a turning wave.", "birthday": "2016-10-04T13:36:00+01:00", "date": "2016-10-04 12:36:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 4}

Consider for a moment your favourite internet meme - infinitely replicable. At any one time there could exist innumerable copies of it across computers all around the world.\n\nFigure 1.

Recently the authorities of the UK and Sweden has warned investors that OneCoin is suspected to be a pyramid scheme with no verifiable evidence to back up any of its business claims.\nAccording to Tim Tayshun, CEO of Ezcoin, OneCoin is pure fraud and deception. He gave Cointelegraph his version of events that took place during the conference when OneCoin had mysteriously doubled the coin of every member.\nWhen asked whether OneCoin really delivered a new Blockchain to its clients, Tim Tayshun said: \u00a0\n \u201cTo 8,500 or so Onecoin cult members attending an event that day, the answer would be a resounding yes.\u201d \n\u201cKeep money in the game\u201d\nTim Tayshun continues his story: \u201cEven a day prior to the event, Joby Boughey, formerly involved in the U-Token/U-Fun affair stated in a video on his Facebook page, that after today \u201cnobody will say it\u2019s a scam!\u201d Ken Labine, Canada\u2019s\u00a0#1 Onecoin\u00a0dealer, had similar things to say. However, upon closer inspection even my own jaw dropped at the tremendous caper being orchestrated live at the \u201cOneLife Mastermind Event\u201d at the Impact Arena in Bangkok, Thailand. It was midnight California time when the fun began and the \u201cchat box\u201d on the live video stream was opened for all...\u201d\n\nRuja Ignatova, CEO of OneCoin claimed that the mining taking place was being shown live onstage on their new Blockchain. Tim Tayshun thinks that was untrue:\u00a0\u201cWhat we could clearly see is that the only thing that was \u201cswitched on\u201d was a flashing banner over THIS LOOPED VIDEO.\u201d\n\nAs Tim Tayshun recalls, there was no explanation whatsoever of how or if the old coins were transferred to the new Blockchain. He also thinks that it is impossible to mine so many coins within just a minute:\n \u201cIt was claimed that in roughly 60 seconds, the first Genesis block of the new Blockchain \u2018mined\u2019 1,986,580,000 coins. This is nearly 100x (94.5x) the amount of Bitcoin that will ever have been created over the next 124 years when the last Satoshi is finally rewarded sometime around the year of 2140.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \nTim Tayshun noted that Ruja announced the coin will go public during the second quarter of 2018. Tim doesn\u2019t believe it: \u201cOneCoin claims every coin is worth $7.80, and each OneCoin block will disperse exactly 50,000 coins per minute. The total market cap of top 100 Cryptocurrencies is $12,210,633,867. OneCoin is saying the new Blockchain will be pumping out coins worth more than the market cap of the top 100 crypto-currencies combined \u2013 every 30 days\u201d.\n \u201cSo, by snapping her fingers and waving her magic wand and yelling, \u201cGo! Go! Go! Mine!\u201d Ruja is projecting one trillion Dollars worth of coins in 5 years - says Tim Tayshun. - OneCoin logic doesn\u2019t even try to make sense.\u201d \nHow OneCoin operates\n\nCointelegraph asked Tim Tayshun to explain how the OneCoin system is working.

Lundkvist stressed the importance of simplification to make Ethereum technology more accessible to everyone.\n\u201cIn my opinion, the main problem with using Blockchain based systems like Ethereum or Bitcoin is the need for the end user to manage private and public keys securely\u201d, says Lundkvist, \u201cWith uPort we aim to hide that complexity from the user and make the interaction more intuitive.\u201d\nAnother visionary feature of uPort is the \u201cSocial Recovery\u201d system for recovering lost or stolen ID.

The technology still is, however, very much in development, and much of its current use remains either speculative or hypothetical, with few day-to-day operations of regular businesses relying on smart contracts. This is because Ethereum smart contracts only have access to information on their own Blockchain, and need a way to communicate with the outside world to be truly effective.\nTo bridge this gap in Ethereum\u2019s capabilities, middleware \u201coracles\u201d can be employed to communicate data from the world outside of the Blockchain, permitting smart contracts to be truly useful. For example, a smart contract for recurring payment or salary in cryptocurrency would employ a price oracle to determine the exact amount to be distributed while adjusting for market fluctuations.\nCointelegraph spoke to Fran Strajnar\u00a0about the development of oracles as Ethereum\u2019s missing link to make smart contracts truly useful to the regular business world.\nCointelegraph: There seems to be a relative lack of applications using Ethereum in a real-world use cases. Why do you think that is?\nFran Strajnar: The main reason there is a lack of commercial use for smart-contracts, is because of the lack of interoperability. Smart-Contracts need to communicate with the real-world to be useful. To achieve this, infrastructure, standards and protocols first need to be developed. Companies like Oracilze, Smartcontract.com and others building what is effectively middleware solutions, are going to play a key role in helping commercialize Blockchain applications by helping make smart-contracts useful in the real world.\nCT: Would it be fair to say, then, that at this current stage Ethereum is over-hyped?\nFS: I wouldn't say it's overhyped. It's relative. I personally think we should see 10x more research and development being dedicated to exploring tangible use of various Blockchain designs. At the same time, Ethereum is just one innovation and is taking up the lion's share of attention.\nCT: You mentioned middleware being a crucial component to effective smart contract use. Does Ethereum need solutions like these in order to be useful?\nFS: Absolutely.

Conventional wisdom held that Bitcoin was thriving due to the pervasive regulations in force.\nFinancial repression is over\nHowever, five years later, financial repression is mostly part of the past. In December 2015, the conservative candidate Mauricio Macri\u00a0was elected president and he quickly reversed the monetary restrictions. The new context made most people wonder if the momentum for Bitcoin in the South American country has come.\nDespite battling the arrival of Uber\u00a0in the country and keeping tax rates high, Macri administration presents itself as a business-friendly government and its officials have repeatedly boasted about the important role of entrepreneurs and startups in the economy.\nFar from unfounded speculations, Bitcoin entrepreneurs knew the cryptocurrency came to stay. For them, they say, this is just the beginning. \u201cBitcoin is not a tool to avoid taxes or wage a guerrilla-style, economic war against a corrupt government subjugating\u201d a whole country, Nubis Bruno, managing partner of Bitex.la SRL, a Bitcoin exchange and remittances company, told Cointelegraph:\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s better to regard it as a solution to the structural problems of the financial system.\u201d\nBruno said the large local Bitcoin community wasn\u2019t born out of economic restrictions, but the Argentineans\u2019 love-story with Bitcoin has more to do with its idiosyncrasy. \u201cArgentina is a large producer of technological early adopters, user communities, and our DNA is bi-monetary,\u201d he explains.\nYet, Bitcoin has a long way to go for Argentineans. Argentina hosts the largest Bitcoin community in Latin America, and is home to dozens of entrepreneurs that have launched diverse startups, but the volume at the exchanges is minimum \u201cespecially when compared to other countries without a community of Bitcoin enthusiasts,\u201d Bruno added.\nGood health for Bitcoin in Argentina\nAt SatoshiTango, a Buenos Aires-based Bitcoin exchange, doubts arose over the future of Bitcoin after the government lifted currency controls. However, they quickly realized that their situation was going to improve, SatoshiTango Co-founder Mat\u00edas Bari said.\nFor Bari, the removal of currency controls are good news for Bitcoin. \u201cBitcoin is most used in countries with no financial repression, no controls,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd having an economy in order is better for business.\u201d\n\u2028Nine months into Macri presidency, Bari says they \u201chaven\u2019t seen a decline neither in the number of users signing up to our platform nor the volume of transactions\u201d.\n\u201cWe saw an increase in volume and number of companies operating with Bitcoin after the removal of currency controls,\u201d Bruno confirmed.", "birthday": "2016-10-08T13:12:00+01:00", "date": "2016-10-08 12:12:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 8}

Rijk Plasman, founder of Gulden, tells Cointelegraph about the currency\u2019s rise:\n \u201cWe make stuff that people can and want to use. At the moment word-of-mouth is what gets us new users\u201d. \nOpposite approach of Bitcoin\nBitcoin\u2019s impressive Blockchain distributed ledger technology has reshaped the financial world, as well as provoked a new rush of applications for the technology. As successful as the currency itself is, it still struggles to reach the general public and common use. Much of the Bitcoin industry remains insular and concentrated around a limited group of technical users, and its use by \u201cmom-and-pop\u201d small, non-technical businesses is extremely rare.\nMeanwhile, Gulden has taken the opposite approach of Bitcoin, instead gearing itself towards easy adoption by the public. Through a strategic partnership with the Nocks app, Gulden remains easily tradable for both Bitcoin and euros, removing as many complications for average users as possible. This long-term slow and steady adoption strategy is finally paying off, as the currency has grown from a minor market cap of about $400,000 early this year to about $2.2 million now, all without any major breakthroughs, business deals, integrations, or hype.\n\nInterview with Rijk Plasman\nCointelegraph spoke to Rijk Plasman, founder of Gulden, about the currency\u2019s slow rise and steady breakthrough.\nCointelegraph: Gulden has seen an impressive, and by the looks of it sustainable, growth in market cap and volume this year. To what do you credit this growth?\nRijk Plasman: The volume is coming from outside the crypto community, which is exactly what we want. Most purchases are coming through Nocks, that means small amounts, 10/25/50 euros. So not just a few big investors but lots of new users. We can also see this in the app downloads.\nCT: Did any big news or events spur this growth, or was it just a slow and steady increase in adoption that caused the increase?\nRP: Definitely the last, we never use our development to hype stuff. We make stuff that people can and want to use. At the moment word-of-mouth is what gets us new users. People like the apps and tell their friends and family. For us this feels like baby-steps but also a confirmation that we are on the right track. In the coming weeks we will launch our new desktop app, which sets the standard for usability and has features that you actually use in real life.\nCT: How centered in the Netherlands is the Gulden user base currently?\nRP: Well less than I expected, we can see that in our Slack channel, it\u2019s 50/50. We have users from all over the world. Our focus is not just the Netherlands, with the apps you can send money to your IBAN in the whole of Europe. And the BTC payments work worldwide of course. \u00a0But we like starting in the Netherlands because it\u2019s a challenging and crowded market, people are overwhelmed with banking apps and fintech startups. So we need to offer something truly better for people to use it. It\u2019s a great user acceptance test.\nCT: One of the prime challenges with Bitcoin in a point-of-sale merchant setting is the delay in transaction confirmations, or potentially risky zero-confirmation transactions. Has Gulden improved on this?\nRP: That's a very good point and it's one of those things where you have to be realistic. No merchant wants to wait minutes for confirmations. So that has to change and we are doing that with Prime. Prime is a system that we will be introducing in the coming months especially designed for that. The first part allows for transactions with just 1 confirmations and Prime 2 makes 0 confirmations possible. We are not developing this because it sounds cool or innovative, but because you need this to be competitive in this market.", "birthday": "2016-10-03T11:45:00+01:00", "date": "2016-10-03 10:45:00", "year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 3}

It has been trumpeted as a complement to other positive Bitcoin-related developments in India such as Zebpay\u2019s recent announcement to have crossed the 100,000 downloads milestone for Android and iOS devices on its app-based Bitcoin exchange to highlight \"India's growing interest in bitcoin as an investment, commodity and technology.\" \u00a0\nZebpay is eyeing a user-base of more than 450,000 by the end of 2016.

And so on.\nI bet you that with these new happenings, more investors are going to pay more attention to the country as well as the Bitcoin potential therein.\nFrom India to South Africa\nIt is just a matter of time for the bubble to burst in India and a little sooner for the multiplier effect of the burst to spill over to Africa.\nAfter India, Africa will take it up starting with South Africa and the continent\u2019s former largest economy, Nigeria.\nThere is a cultural link between Indians and South Africa due to the Gandhi connection and Indians\u2019 contribution to the to the African National Congress's struggle against the Apartheid regime and bilateral trade between them has grown to around $12 billion. This factor is likely to contribute to the growth of Bitcoin activities between the two countries - and in a larger context - between the two continents.\nMore than any other African country, Bitcoin-related activities are higher in South Africa where you have the likes of Bitx and ICE3x running things with their exchanges which are also connected to other parts of the world including Asian countries like Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.\nKenya\nAs the momentum is building steadily in South Africa as well as the system making for a sustained growth, so is it happening in Kenya.

Ryan Taylor of Dash sees why Bitcoin is failing to take over the world.\nBitcoin is in a lull. For the past several months, the frontrunner of the cryptocurrency world has experienced relatively stagnant value. Both the number of transactions and total transaction value have not risen significantly this year, and Google search terms have not seen meaningful growth over the last few years, certainly nothing like in 2013. The digital currency revolution we were promised has largely failed to materialize.\nCointelegraph spoke with Ryan Taylor, Dash\u2019s director of finance, about the future of digital currency, and the challenges Bitcoin faces if it intends to continue to lead the global financial revolution.\nCointelegraph: Do you feel that Bitcoin has stagnated in any way?\nRyan Taylor: Bitcoin and its ecosystem is obviously still growing, but it is losing market share and momentum. The pace of investment in Bitcoin\u2019s ecosystem has slowed down as the reality has set in about how difficult mainstream adoption will be. With Bitcoin\u2019s first-mover advantage and network effects, it really should be doing better than it is. I think the main issue Bitcoin faces going forward is that it has become the proverbial \u201coil tanker\u201d of the industry\u2026 while it\u2019s certainly massive, it simply isn\u2019t designed to be nimble enough to chart a new course quickly in a rapidly evolving industry.\nCT: Bitcoin\u2019s relatively niche status: Perfectly fine and by design, or an undesirable outcome?\nRT: Many people involved with digital currencies measure anything short of a replacement of government money as a failure. I don\u2019t share that view. A well-functioning financial system provides an array of solutions to meet a variety of needs. It would be impossible for just one solution to meet all financial needs in a market, especially since needs in different market segments are sometimes polar opposites.\nMany of Bitcoin\u2019s attributes are unique and add value to the overall system, but we can\u2019t expect it will replace other components. The original goal was simply to create a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash without requiring a financial institution, and by that measure, Bitcoin largely succeeded. However, to capture a more significant share of financial transactions, Bitcoin needs to become easier to use in the decentralized way it was intended. Dash is working on making digital currencies more in keeping with the original vision, but much easier to use without the use of centralized services.\nCT: Cryptocurrency in general has turned into an interesting field of technological experimentation and day-trading speculation. Is this its true potential, or is it something that will become a more traditional-style mainstream payment method?\nRT: Obviously, for the speculation to pay off, digital currency needs to eventually provide value, otherwise this will be just an asset bubble. I think the industry is maturing slowly in this direction despite some very entrenched and stubborn views that Bitcoin is the ultimate solution. Bitcoin has many flaws, and the industry shouldn\u2019t be so reluctant to embrace competition. I believe that is the only way the original vision can be achieved.\nI personally think that digital currencies will provide value in a number of ways. First, it can ease global commerce. If you need to exchange currencies anyway to transact overseas, why not use one foreign currency for all of your cross-border transactions? This is possible with digital currencies if one or more become ubiquitous like Visa and Mastercard. For consumers and businesses that reside in countries with strict currency controls and high inflation, digital currencies can act as a \u201cbackstop\u201d for how bad their country\u2019s monetary system can become before they would abandon it for a digital alternative. Finally, it can also reduce the cost of transactions substantially. For all these reasons, I think there are areas of the global economy where digital currency going mainstream is almost inevitable.", "birthday": "2016-09-29T12:35:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-29 11:35:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 29}

The Central Bank issued a resolution banning \u201cany kind of currency that is not issued and controlled by a government or an authorized entity\u201d citing consumer protection concerns.\n\u201cPeople using Bitcoin has been exposed and suffered monetary losses,\u201d argued a report on electronic money released by the Central Bank in May of that year.\nTwo years and counting, the Bitcoin activity still remains flat in the country. \u201cI notice people are afraid of Bitcoin,\u201d says Alonso Vaca-Pereira, creator of the \u201cBitcoin Bolivia\u201d Facebook group.\n \u201cGovernments have linked it to drug-trafficking and illegal activities so people prefer to stay away from cryptocurrencies.\u201d \n\u201cRight now, the cryptoscene consists of in-person exchanges which are mainly coordinated through scattered Facebook groups, with no more than 20 - 30 members. Due to the legal status of Bitcoin in the country these groups tend to be private and in order to join them one must exchange some Bitcoins with the current members,\u201d Vaca-Pereira told Cointelegraph.\n\u201cI have some ideas to develop with Bitcoin in Bolivia, but taking risks with the current regulation is quite complicated,\u201d he says, \u201cparticularly with the current government.\u201d", "birthday": "2016-09-29T15:40:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-29 14:40:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 29}

They are not just experts in finance but in technology as well, therefore they can react to the market\u2019s and clients\u2019 demands much quicker.\nHungary\u2019s Fintech sector is teeming with good ideas. Cointelegraph takes a look at some promising, internationally successful Fintech companies.\nIND Group and the digital banking experience\nFounded in 1997, IND Group provides integrated front-office solutions mainly to banks and financial institutions. IND is a prosperous Central European company, winning one professional award after another. Different solutions such as mobile-apps and websites are able to connect to their self-developed front-end platform. We can typically meet the company\u2019s products when we use internet banking.\nPeople\u2019s aversion toward banks usually stem from the fact that banks think in terms of products \u2013 therefore we clients do not feel the process is personal. This is what IND aims to change. Accessibility, comprehensibility, usability and security. These are the aspects that they consider most important while continuously building online interfaces of mobile and internet banking.\nIn 2014 IND was taken over by the world\u2019s leading financial software company Misys. Since then IND functions as a separate division of the London-based company. The goals did not change, user experience is still the crucial point.\nShinrai and the Bitcoin ATM in a Budapest ruin pub\nShinrai is another company that was founded in Budapest but is now controlled from London \u2013 they are a Fintech startup fighting for widespread Bitcoin use. They operate Hungary\u2019s first online Bitcoin exchange Mr. Coin, and they installed the country\u2019s first Bitcoin ATM in one of the most popular ruin pubs of Budapest in August of 2014.\nWith their marketing strategies, they target the Millennials because this generation is the most open towards the world of digital currency. Although they relocated their headquarters to the British capital they still have strong connections with the Central European region, and Mr.Coin services many clients from those regions of the planet that allow bank transfers. The platform developed by the company offers an easy and safe place to exchange virtual currency.\nFor us Europeans it is hard to imagine that in certain parts of the world not all people have bank accounts. Shinrai believes that everyone should have access to such basic financial services, even if their home country yet lacks the required infrastructure. It seems evident to use a Bitcoin account in such cases, which you require just a smartphone and an app downloaded \u2013 it seems so obvious, yet it isn\u2019t.\nRealising the problem Shinrai developed a payment platform that encourages banks and financial service providers to join. With the help of this platform they can connect themselves \u2013 and the advanced western world \u2013 to the economies of developing countries. The secret to Shinrai\u2019s success is not just innovation, but the idea of commitment to predictability and sustainability.\nSeon and I\u2019m not a robot\nOnline scams are a booming business, but there is a Hungarian startup that aims to filter out hackers and prevent the damage caused by them. The API developed by Seon helps in any online transactions when there is a need to identify the user such as web-based registrations and logins.\nSeon primarily provides a secure environment for websites and sites that handle financial transactions, but beyond e-commerce it is also able to filter out bots in online voting.\nThe program constructs a profile of the user based on hundreds of variables such as IP addresses, email addresses, credit card numbers, publicly shared social media content, and it also recognises users behind VPN networks. An important part of the software is that it monitors the client's previous purchases, the location of these transactions, and the devices used. Personal data is of course handled in the strictest, most secure means. Based on the collected data, the system estimates the risk of the user and their initiated transactions. The client is then able to oversee the users\u2019 profiles on the admin interface and can block the suspicious ones.", "birthday": "2016-09-30T17:13:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-30 16:13:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 30}

Why ZCash May Not Live Up To Expectations ", "content": "ZCash, a new Zooko Wilcox project, has impressive list of investors and advisers, but will the new cryptocurrency pass the reality check of decentralisation and anonymity?\nGenesis block\u2019s launch is near\nOctober 28 may see the launch of the genesis block of ZCash - a new cryptocurrency from the same name project led by Zooko Wilcox. The project causes great interest: without being a genuine market player yet, the company has become a part of Digital Currency Group; the buzz around ZCash is really huge, and the currency itself was valued even before the actual release. On the surface it seems that nothing can go wrong; however, there are few things that might compromise the success of the ZCash project.\nComplex structure behind the currency\nThere are two words which became synonymous to the very definition of cryptocurrency: anonymity and decentralization. Usually, these two principles are respected not only towards end-users, but also among people \u201con the other side\u201d. So far, the community still tries to find out who hides under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto; in many other cases we know one or several personalities standing behind one or another currency - but nothing more.\nZCash development team is doing fine without anonymity; rather, they prefer talking about themselves quite openly. This is understandable: they are sincerely proud of their creation, proud of being noticed and supported by such influential people and companies from cryptocurrency world. There something that ZCash doesn\u2019t hide as well - its impressive list of investors. \u00a0\nApparently, such a strong patronage creates obligations. What else explains that there are several levels of power standing behind the \u0441urrency?\nThus, in addition to the main team of engineers and scientists, ZCash also has a whole group of advisers, Gavin Andresen and Vitalik Buterin among them. Following the advisor team, here comes outside council consisting of encryption, litigation and financial regulation experts. And don\u2019t forget the investors! \u00a0Pretty massive for a company that haven\u2019t even fully entered the market yet.\n(De)centralized\nSome crypto community members also paid attention to that fact and took it suspiciously. Indeed, it\u2019s not what users are used to; having such a complex structure around the currency raises questions. Could this in any way be combined with the constant cryptocurrency principle - decentralization? Doubtful.\nThe monetary base of ZCash is going to be the same as Bitcoin\u2019s: 21 million ZEC are expected to be mined by 2032.\nAs developers state, at first, 50 ZEC will be created every 10 minutes. And that\u2019s where the most interesting part begins: not all generated coins comes to miners\u2019 hands. It\u2019s all about the so-called Founders Reward, the system where 20% of the newly mined ZEC will go to the founders. Such way of funds distribution is going to last 4 years, till the first ZEC halving.\nAll figures are clearly displayed in this diagram. So, during the moment all 21M ZEC are mined, Founders Reward will give 10% to ZCash Company stakeholders (founders, investors, employees and advisers) - and it\u2019s neither more nor less of 2.1 million ZEC.\nKilling anonymity\nHowever, the situation can turn out even more serious. For more than 5 years now, cryptocurrencies are subject to the regulation of the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The FinCEN regulations also cover the main actors in the whole process - miners; one of rulings states: if the user mines cryptocurrency solely for his (or her) own use, it won\u2019t cause any problems with the current law. However, considering the whole \u201cFounders Reward\u201d thing, how can anybody guarantee ZCash miners won\u2019t be taken for Money Service Business (MSB)?", "birthday": "2016-09-30T12:25:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-30 11:25:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 30}

It starts on October 1, and will end on November 10. \nThe platform offers immense advantages over legacy lotto games, such as provably fair draw, easy ticket purchases and instant payouts regardless of your country of residence. \n .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }  \n   \n\u00a0 \nHuge audience, no innovation \nJanuary this year, three ticket owners won a combined Powerball jackpot of $1.5 bln; at the time of writing, this event holds the record for the largest lottery jackpot ever won. It is reported that in the days leading to, and on January 13, a combined total of more than 635 million of Powerball tickets were sold to the players. \nThat is just one major event out of numerous, concerning one country and one lottery game. The overall vastness of the audience of all the different lottos across the globe is even more impressive; as hundreds of millions of tickets are sold in so many countries every week, there is no lack of people willing to try their luck in the numbers game. \nThe appeal of seeing if blind chance can make you filthy rich has huge effect on millions of players, which is quite surprising, considering the fact that no innovation has happened on the market of lottery games for decades. Well, it is happening now. \nBlockchain makes perfect \nLike in many other industries, Blockchain\u2019s transparency and immutability can offer immense advantages to a lottery game. Even more so, as it can eliminate specific criticisms leveled at the businesses of today. \nThe first issue the players have to face is associated with buying the actual lottery tickets. \nFor example, if you want to participate in a Powerball game, you can\u2019t do that over mail, phone or internet - selling tickets over these are illegal in the US. So, in order to even have a shot at winning, you\u2019d have to travel to the States and buy tickets in person, which makes no economic sense when you take the chance of winning into consideration. \nKibo takes care of that by allowing purchases to anyone with access to the Internet. All the winnings are paid out in cryptocurrencies, and the same goes for buying tickets. Which means that you don\u2019t have to travel anywhere, but can rather participate from the comfort of your own home. \nThe fact that Kibo is operating on the Internet and is powered by the Blockchain also allows for easier payouts. If you win in a regular lottery, you have to give up a huge amount of your prize (about 25%, depending on the jurisdiction) in taxes. Additional difficulties may arise if you\u2019ve won a foreign lottery, making you wait for a very long time until you can arrange the legal issues and claim your money. \nWhereas with Kibo, payouts are made in seconds, even across borders, and you don\u2019t have to worry about the IRS taking a quarter of your prize. \nKey feature: Smart Contracts \nLast but not least is the transparency which comes with the use of Blockchain. A very important feature of Kibo is that it runs on Smart Contracts - a cutting-edge technology, pioneered by the Ethereum network. Smart contracts work in a similar way to regular business contracts: they list certain terms of exchange between involved parties, which get fulfilled in a certain manner under specified conditions. \nThe key difference is that the fulfilment of Smart Contracts is managed by machine code. What that means is that the entire mechanism of the game can be checked and verified by any user at any time, and all game processes are free from tampering by unscrupulous parties. \nAll the transactions are represented on a publicly accessible ledger, which is the Blockchain, and the process of making draws is perfectly fair, which any user can check for themselves. \n.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }\n", "birthday": "2016-09-30T18:40:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-30 17:40:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 30}

McTaggart and Matthew R. Silver of Pepper Hamilton LLP.\nHowever, Harvard University\u2019s Stephanie Lo and J. Christina Wang of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in Bitcoin as Money?, noted that Bitcoin must be accepted as payment for a sufficiently large set of goods or services, or other assets to serve as a medium of exchange.\nTheir paper says:\n\u201cA user is willing to accept a fiat money as payment for other objects of value only if she is confident that enough others will be willing to accept it in turn from her. Unlike the regular fiat money, however, Bitcoin is not backed by any sovereign entity that can compel the acceptance of its affiliated fiat money within a certain realm. Therefore, in order to serve as a medium of exchange, Bitcoin has to rely solely on the self-fulfilling expectation on the part of private agents that it will be accepted.\u201d\nCommunity support\nClaasen pointed out that respondents were encouraged to participate via membership email list, Facebook and Twitter, Reddit r/Bitcoin and r/BTC/.\nLlew Claasen says:\n\u201cWe're not under any illusion that we're going to directly influence the protocol product roadmap during this plan to end 2017.

The Bitcoin network, for instance, is protected by miners located around the world who contribute their computing power to verify and authenticate transactions in the network.\nThis distributed protocol of the Bitcoin network allows it to store data in a irrefutable and unalterable ledger, which is virtually impossible to breach and hack due to the hashrate of the Bitcoin network. However, when a centralized Blockchain network is created and deployed, its security measures and protocols have to be significantly impaired, as, in theory, the data will be stored in a centralized server.\nIf data sets are stored in a centralized Blockchain in a centralized server, it poses no difference than traditional databases which are maintained by a central authority.

Different public and private organizations routinely request identity information from people and companies and often this information has to be given repeatedly even in one day.\nDeloitte is working on a \u2018smart identity\u2019 based on Blockchain technology that aims to solve forever this complex problem and take us out of the era of paper based identification.\nBlockchain can provide one identity for all\nLetting users manage their own identity and having it verified from trustable third parties can open the doors to an era where we will be free from the shackles of having to keep proving who we are all the time.\nDigital identities run on Blockchain chain tech can not only allow individuals and businesses to be verified but also \u2018things\u2019.\nWe talked with Alexander Shelkovnikov, Deloitte Ventures and Blockchain Lead in the UK, about how far along the project has come. He says:\n \u201cSmart Identity is a working prototype which is constantly evolving based on real feedback from users. It offers news ways for individuals, organisations and things/objects to obtain and use verified identity credentials to transact with one another.\u201d \nSelf-sovereign identity is far away\nIn an ideal world, people should be able to manage their own identities and be in charge of how these identities are shared. Deloitte recognize the need for this but they think we are far away from that goal. Alexander Shelkovnikov remarks:\n \u201cThe end goal is to get to a world where users would be able to own and administer their identities securely and seamlessly. We do, however, realise that it\u2019s an evolutionary process and we\u2019d need to go through a number of phases before we are able to reach the state of a truly self-sovereign identity in a way that is accepted and trusted by governments, regulators, financial institutions and more.\u201d \nIdentities of people and things\nA central question to any sort of digital identity should be who does the identity serve?\nWhen people part with information about themselves, they invariably do so with the expectation that their privacy is maintained and the identity information is used for the purpose for which it is shared. As Alexander Shelkovnikov puts it:\n \u201cThe power of Smart Identity is that it\u2019s designed in a way that would allow for identities of both individuals, organisations and even things/ objects. We don\u2019t look at these segments in isolation as increasingly we see the need for interaction and easy interfaces between the consumer and enterprise world when it comes to the provision of different services. As things like self-driving cars, drones and other internet-connected devices become part of our everyday lives, these types of objects each would also need to have an identity record which is secure but, at the same time, easy to administer or, where necessary, to control.\u201d \nFlexibility to operate on any Blockchain", "birthday": "2016-09-26T12:53:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-26 11:53:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 26}

Of late there is a profusion of hype in circulation about a seemingly magical data structure called a \u201cBlockchain\u201d.\u00a0\nIllusionists like Harry Houdini and his ilk can be a great source of entertainment, but when the trick involves a disappearing act on customer confidence, something is amiss.

Ethereum has once again returned back inside its flat. What will come next?\nETH/USD\nFollowing a meet-up with Vitalik Buterin in Shanghai, an intraday upward trend was formed. Ether\u2019s price, after fortifying at the top limit of the long-term flat near $13, has formed an upward impulse toward the accumulated volume of sell orders near $14.5.\nAs reported by Vitalik himself, the switch to PoS is preliminarily planned for summer 2017. The reason for such a long delay is; at the moment there are no working algorithms for PoS mining itself, and for the process of transfer to it. The uncertainty of the time frame means that its influence on the price movement is weak, so the\u00a0trend wasn\u2019t a long one.\nAlso, as was predicted on the day of the Shanghai conference by Jeffrey Wilke, one of the core developers, Ethereum was targeted by a DDoS attack on September 22. As a direct consequence, the network began running much slower. This attack was initiated right when Ether\u2019s price has turned downward near $13.5. The price has formed a short-term downward trend, and returned to the top limit of the long-term sideways movement, remaining inside the flat.\n\nThe structure of the upward movement is broken, with Ethereum being back inside the flat. If there had been more support from the bulls, Ethereum\u2019s price would at least be able to fortify above $13. But that didn\u2019t happen, and at the moment the flat is continuing. A key level near $12 is worthy of note. An accumulated volume of buy orders there is a good support line for the upward trend. The importance of this volume is confirmed by two technicals intersecting there: Fibonacci 61.8% retracement and diagonal channel. These instruments are indicative of the most probable peak of a correction of a certain scale. Both Fibonacci fans and the diagonal channel are a classic. By synthesizing these instruments, one can measure price fluctuations within any time scale with a certain degree of precision.\nThe $12 mark is the most likely peak for a downward correction, and after reaching it, there will be two likely scenarios for future development. One option is that there will be a rebound and the upward movement will continue for at least one more flat wave towards $14. Alternatively, Ethereum\u2019s price can have sufficient support from the bears, and after fortifying it at that mark, will form a turn. The fall has potential to be a powerful one, with price going down as low as $8, given how few sell orders are there between $12 and $8. It will be more profitable for the bears to bring Ether\u2019s price down to $8.\nFor an upward scenario to come true, Ethereum has to pass the level of $15. The $15 mark is the new upper limit of the long-term flat. That is why the price is likely to rebound from that level, and then continue moving inside the flat. A fortification at that level will be indicative of the bulls\u2019 strength, after which an upward impulse can follow, just as it did on September 19.", "birthday": "2016-09-27T11:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-27 10:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 27}

The bulls\u2019 doubts are shown. The most recent surges of the price towards that resistance, just like the sharp returns to the starting point, are what\u2019s indicative of the differing opinions of the crowd.

The volume of buy orders at that level is several times larger than that of sell orders at $13. The situation is shaping in favor of an upward movement, as long as that support exists.

Such reactions happen due to large volumes that accumulate during the side-way movement.\n\nIt seems that this reaction of Ether\u2019s price is corresponding to the conference in Shanghai, which took place on September 19. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, planned to present a new version of the protocol. The third version of the document will allow Ether to move on to the proof-of-stake algorithm, which was planned to begin in March this year.

Given the seemingly self-defeating nature of using decentralized currencies in highly centralized operations, Cointelegraph asked top industry experts from Agentic UK, Lisk and Steemit about their opinion on the matter.\nLucas Cervigni, Managing Director of Agentic UK, explains:\n \u201cRecently, central banks have taken the Cryptocurrency asset to the next level by starting to research Cryptocurrencies of their own. As modern banking works under the fractional reserve system, this research makes sense. Through this system, banks are able to issue loans as long as they keep 10% in reserve. In turn, this creates money with each loan. That is not possible with Bitcoin and therefore the banks have begun considering centralized and government controlled cryptocurrencies. However this is a serious matter for the banks to consider, as should the central system issue all of the money, there is no doubt the dynamics of the fractional reserve system could change. Ultimately, the smaller banks could be left out of business.\u201d \nState banks eyeing Blockchain\nPeople's Bank of China (PBoC) announced on their website about their own digital currency conference, urging their team to speed up efforts to release its digital currency. Bank of England and Bank of Canada have also considered developing digital currencies.\nThese types of currencies are called Central Bank-issued Digital Currency (CBDC). What are the implications of CBDC? To create a cashless society, steal the spotlight from Bitcoin and other privately-issued currencies, or to achieve a more accurate monetary policy?\nBanks want control\nNed Scott, Founder of Steemit, thinks the bank-issued cryptocurrencies will differ from the protocols we got accustomed to:\n \u201cIt would be interesting to see what design choices the banks make for their Cryptocurrencies' protocols and how they integrate the currency with their business. With every cryptocurrency there are variables that developers massage in terms of emission and the way they release the protocol into the wild. My feeling is that the profile of these Bank-issued coins would be very different from many of the decentralized protocols we see today. Banks are likely entertaining the idea more seriously if they feel they can control the currency, as well as gain from its use and possibly their manipulation over it.\u201d \nA necessary evil", "birthday": "2016-09-20T12:45:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-20 11:45:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 20}

The community is at a crossroads with two differing opinions on forking the network from 1MB to 20MB.\nYet, getting most of the validating nodes, miners and the rest of the bionetwork on board in an appropriate manner is a very significant issue. One camp thinks that the current network with its mere 7 transactions per second is debilitating and uncompetitive. However, the other camp believes that promoting a hard fork will revert transactions, which is the opposite of the basic principles of the Blockchain technology and its immutable ledger.\nRoger Ver: Split of ETH was a good thing\nCointelegraph spoke to Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com, on whether Bitcoin should scale or not at this crucial moment in its march to become a global digital currency of choice. Asked whether scalability will lead to a split in the Bitcoin community as already has happened with Ethereum, Roger had this to say:\n \u201cThe market clearly stated that the split of ETH into two forks was a good thing as shown by the increased market cap after the split. I think letting the two camps with incompatible visions for Bitcoin go their own way will also be a good thing.\u201d \nCointelegraph: Why is Bitcoin hard forking a necessary step?\nRoger Ver: Any time two camps have incompatible views they should go their separate way.\nCT: What accounts for the animosity towards hard forking?\nRV: I think 99% of the animosity in the Bitcoin ecosystem is a direct result of Theymos\u2019 policies of not allowing dissenting opinions on the main Bitcoin discussion platforms that he controls.\u00a0The fact that the side benefiting from the suppression of certain opinions has hardly complained about it at all, while some even openly support it, added a huge amount of fuel to the fire.

They are building on the untapped opportunities available to the country\u2019s billion people.\nSurge in Internet use\nIndia has overtaken the United States to become the world\u2019s second largest Internet market, with 333 million users, behind China\u2019s 721 million.\nEven though this is a positive development, the new report by the UN Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development also confirms that just six nations \u2013 including China and India \u2013 together account for 55% of the total global population still offline, because of the sheer size of their populations. In other words, there are still more people to be connected in countries like India.\nWhat could become of the Indian market soon is slightly reflected in the Chinese involvement in Bitcoin trading and exchanges, particularly when there is a sharp drop in the Yuan\u2019s value.\nBitcoin is already big in India\nKumar Gaurav, the CEO of the Blockchain remittance company Cashaa, says that India is certainly one of the emerging markets for Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies due to such obvious reasons like having a young population, an increase in smartphone and Internet penetration, and the mass market which makes it very attractive market for both investors and entrepreneurs.\nHe says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cIndia also has the largest population of engineers which gives us a huge market which can adopt technical products at a faster rate. Bitcoin is one such product. But I also see there are a few challenges in India such as an already well-developed central banking system which is cheaper and automated. To make way for cryptocurrency in India, entrepreneurs need to sell the products based on the advantages of cryptocurrency, rather than the cryptcurrency itself.\u201d \nLooking beyond the optimism that lies ahead of this key digital currency in the world\u2019s second most populated country, Mohit Kalra, CEO of Coinsecure, \u00a0says to Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is already big in India.\nHe notes:\n \"I think India already is a huge market. In the past all Bitcoin trades have been offline, mainly through personal connections or by finding people on forums, which was a tricky situation, as no one actually knew each other and it started becoming a risky thing to do. It's just very recently that all trades are moving online so the buyer and seller do not have to worry about who they are trading with as exchanges like ours will take care of the due diligence. With the pace it's moving at, soon India will be able to reach the level of China. I think India still needs more miners though for generating supply. This will then help India not rely upon other countries for liquidity.\" \nReigning world remittance champion\nThe increased Internet use will soon reflect on the remittance structures available to Indians both within and outside of the country. As at this year\u2019s released figures, India was the world's largest remittance recipient in 2015 despite experiencing a $1 billion drop from the previous year, says the World Bank.\nDespite the drop, which is as a result of a global contraction in remittances by 1.7 per cent to $581.6 billion in 2015, from $592 billion in 2014, the World Bank said India attracted about $69 billion in remittances last year followed by China with $64 billion, the Philippines ($28 billion), Mexico ($25 billion) and Nigeria ($21 billion).\nWide disparity between remittances to India and China\nDespite the larger size, more Internet users, more income and so on, India has been beating China on the remittance scale partly due to statistical, historical and cultural reasons, but mostly economic, says Dilip Ratha the Head of the World Bank\u2019s migration project, called the Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development.\nThough India and China together receive more remittances than the next five countries combined, and they both have huge armies of overseas workers, Indians consistently transfer more money home because their relatives need it, unlike Chinese families who don\u2019t necessarily need remittance money to survive, Mr. Ratha told WSJ.\nRather, they are more likely to send money home to invest in a business. This leads to another reason: \u201cremittance decay\u201d - the amount of money any given migrant worker sends home tends to shrink the longer he or she is away as their links with the home country weaken.\nRatha says this tends to affect the Chinese abroad but not the Indians as they appear to maintain tighter ties with their homeland longer. Indians also have variety of overseas employees. They constitute the richest migrant group in the wealthiest country in the world \u2013 the United States \u2013 and India is still a very poor country, so there is huge need to be met through remittances sent home, says Ratha.\nThis wide disparity between these two sets of people will soon play out as the use of Bitcoin becomes more acceptable on a larger scale in India.\nGrowing concerns over using traditional remittance channels\nSeveral informal channels of transferring funds have been flourishing primarily due to the high cost of formal avenues as well as the low penetration of banks and money transfer agents in India\u2019s interiors.\nThere are indications\u00a0that, as the Prime Minister \u00a0Narendra Modi said at the G20 summit, India is now championing the cause for reducing remittance costs.\nRatha said the technology to provide affordable remittance services is already there but regulations are still standing in the way of new players who are able to introduce efficient technology to the market.", "birthday": "2016-09-22T09:11:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-22 08:11:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 22}

With the power of the Blockchain we can simulate each girl member as if they are a \"corporation\" by issuing tokens. \u00a0I combined two Japanese words, \"toreka - trading cards\" and \"kabu - stock shares\" into one word \"Torekabu.\" Torekabu-nushi, which means Torekabu holders, will receive voting tokens as dividends to make a scenario for each episode.\u201d \nIt is expected that the girls will compete for the market cap and that the Blockchain will facilitate a transparent outcome.\nContestants are lining up to be BitGirls\nThe TV show is already auditioning ten girls to become contestants. Cointelegraph was told by Takao Asayama that three are ready to join. The first voting is to take place using Bitcoin instead of tokens when the TV show will pick 3-5 winners who are titled \u2018idols.\u2019\nThe participants are touted to be highly talented. Among the girls who will participate is a balloon artist, a \u2018race-queen\u2019 and a plastic model builder.

While review-based systems are very subjective and easy to manipulate with fake accounts, payment-based reputation systems are based purely on the monetary value a worker has earned and are harder to manipulate, as money needs to be sent to earn reputation.\n", "birthday": "2016-09-23T16:40:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-23 15:40:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 23}

On average it costs 10-12% to wire cash to Africa, where there is an estimated 80% of the population without access to banking. This is compounded by the lack of a transparent exchange rate. Needless to say many African households depend on remittances from the diaspora. In fact, in some countries remittances dwarf foreign aid.\nCashaa is a peer-to-peer marketplace which enables free cash transfer powered by the Blockchain which can use any kind of digital token or cryptocurrency. The remittance application model is based upon connecting private individuals who wish to send and receive money anywhere in the world. A network of cryptocurrency traders accept the physical cash from the sender in one location and give it to the receiver in another location. Traders then exchange the cash through buying and selling their cryptocurrencies.\nThe money transfer requests are selected and matched through a live bidding process by cryptocurrency traders. Though Cashaa is powered by Bitcoin traders, the platform is cryptocurrency neutral and can eventually operate through whatever digital currency or token the traders prefer. It enables priority money transfers 24/7 in real time, with a transparent exchange rate. This free money transfer service, along with other features, is one that the cash remittance industry has not seen until now.\nMerging two markets\nCointelegraph asks Kumar Gaurav, Cashaa\u2019s co-founder & CEO, about how the application can solve Africa\u2019s exorbitant cash transfer transaction costs.\n \u201cWe consider ourselves as an Uber of the cash transfer industry. Cashaa is the first to solve the problem of the single geographical focus by making the cash delivery and entry points peer-to-peer. \u00a0We developed this innovation by merging two unique markets. \u00a0Without an official launch of our MVP we already have more than 10,000 plus cash-in/out points in 1040 cities, with this growing day by day.\u201d \nCointelegraph: Is Cashaa a solution to the excessive cost of remittances to Africa?\nKumar Gaurav: Yes, according to the reports of the World Bank, Africa is one of the most expensive areas in the world to both sending and receiving cash and, at the same time, is one of the fastest growing areas in the world in terms of the penetration of smartphones. Currently, cash remittance institutions are maximizing their efforts to exploit every dollar which is sent or received from Africa. At Cashaa we want to disrupt their plans by starting with a zero fee model to this continent.\nCT: Did you specifically design this with Africa in mind?\nKG: Cashaa\u2019s mission is to provide an empowering platform which facilitates cash transfer with as low a fee as possible to all countries across the globe. Africa is one of the areas where I believe this mission can be accomplished due to the high demand and extortionate current fee structure. This marketplace will get the maximum advantage through Cashaa\u2019s system ultimately saving ordinary people billions of dollars, which are currently lost in fees.\n", "birthday": "2016-09-18T11:50:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-18 10:50:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 18}

A protracted flat began in the end of October 2015 and the price remained inside a narrower range for more than two months. It was followed by an explosion of long-term growth.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/4-reasons-why-your-nation-will-kill-cash-for-a-digital-currency", "title": " 4 Reasons Why Your Nation Will Kill Cash For A Digital Currency ", "content": "Yes, I\u2019m talking to you. Yes, I\u2019m talking about your country, whether it is Russia, China, or the United States. The more modern and advanced your economy, the faster it is coming your way. The discussions have been going on for a couple of years now on how to do it. The only question is when to spring it on the masses. If you are in a less than a state-of-the-art economy, like Pakistan or Guam, you probably have a lot more time left with the paper. Most of us aren\u2019t so lucky.\nCash has been on the clock in the most advanced nations for years, with central banks limiting how much cash you can get, even from your own account. Limits have been dropping to\u00a0as low as 5000 units of paper in some nations, and even then you will have to surrender your ID or go through some level of interrogation. The future of money does not include paper, and here are four reasons why digital currencies will become your official national currency.\nReason #1 - The best way to control a nation is to control its money supply\nGovernments are all about control. Whether it is doling out welfare programs and entitlement programs or demanding taxes and regulating your ability to trade or live freely, controlling the populace is the goal. The modern banks work together with the governments to control monetary policy, and between the two, if one control grid doesn\u2019t get you, the other one will.\nWhat you spend and where you spend it isn\u2019t actively monitored, yet, but it could be with a phone call, an email, or an\u00a0SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) at your bank. All of your online, ATM and debit/credit card transactions are on a server, and banks are already abusing this access to your financial life. That\u2019s just what we know, much less is \u00a0what we haven\u2019t discovered, yet.\nLet\u2019s turn this around, and imagine an economy without a digital paper trail. Essentially, let\u2019s go back in time to around World War II before all these computers and plastic transactions ruled the world. Imagine, for a moment, that your country just ran on cash. No debit cards, no checks and no digital currency of any kind. This would create a few problems for your government.\nHow would your government know how many dollars there are in the country, or have left the country? Wouldn\u2019t counterfeit paper currency become a huge underground industry, much larger today than it ever was previously? How would you know how many units of paper currency you needed overall? Do you need more, or less, right now? And plenty of business would be done \u201coff the books\u201d to avoid regulation and taxation.\nThis actually works out pretty well for the citizens, as they have a good level of freedom to use the money as they wish, and to be able to use it privately. This is something most of us have taken for granted as a huge advantage of the old Greenback. It is the most private, and direct way to transmit value. If you use a debit card,\u00a0Bitcoin, or a wire transfer, you are creating a massive paper trail that can compromise your identity or security, both now and in the future. Some are just now realizing how important these benefits are today.\nIf you are a government, in bed with the banking industry, wouldn\u2019t it serve your control grid much better to phase out cash?\u00a0More people have smartphones than toothbrushes worldwide. People have become spoiled, and love the easy convenience of doing everything digitally, so take advantage of that reality.\nA\u00a0national digital currency can\u2019t be taken out of the country, as China is dealing with the issues of capital outflows undermining their national economy right now. Between the government, and the banks, every transaction, every deposit, and every balance can be tracked, accessed, taxed, or terminated from your own centralized computer mouse in your digital bunker. How sweet is that? Reason #1 this is coming to a nation near you is because it is simply a better mousetrap. Guess who\u2019s the mouse?\nReason #2 - Take advantage of Bitcoin\u2019s technology before it goes viral\nPeople who have taken the time to become learned in the world of decentralized digital currencies, like Bitcoin, know full well that it is a far superior system than the funny money ways of the central banks. Bitcoin is not designed to become the global reserve currency or even a national currency. It is designed to be a better alternative that you should have in your portfolio.\nA problem for\u00a0Bitcoin is it will take a considerable period of time before the mainstream discovers this truth. The mainstream media, the scammers, and the cyber criminals undermining Bitcoin accounts and exchanges around the world are not going to make mainstream adoption quick and easy. As long as Bitcoin is synonymous with crime and technology that the average person doesn\u2019t understand, there is only so far it will go into the public consciousness.\nThis gives the governments and banks a sweet bit of leverage. What they can do, and are doing, is beginning to use their immense resources to learn how the technology works, knock off the systems, and rebuild them under their own business models. In this gray area of time between the era of early adopters to mass adoption, the economic establishment can come up with their own \u201cfuture of money\u201d system to transfer people over to, before they figure out that Bitcoin is what they really wanted all along.\nThis is why all of these changes and\u00a0Blockchain adoptions, within banks and governments, are happening so fast and so furiously.\u00a0They know it is a race against time. It is only a matter of time before the common man understands that the greater economic system is a centralized hustle built to exploit them. It is only a matter of time before people start using a digital currency built to use on their smartphone. It is only a matter of time before Bitcoin becomes the Internet 2.0, and they know it.\u00a0\nSo, take the open-source technology, spin it for your own private, centralized, closed-network purposes, and Bitcoin will not be so attractive when you give them Bitcoin-lite, now with more surveillance than ever and true access to 100% of the national economic power.\n\u201cThe Internet\u201d went \u2018viral\u2019 after 10-15 years, and Bitcoin is heading into Year #9 soon, so if you were to head off Bitcoin at the pass, now is the time, and the powers that be are sure acting like it. For these reasons, expect sweeping changes in your nation\u2019s currency sooner rather than later.\nReason #3 - More Practical Reasons\nIf you are in a major Western nation with a huge GDP like the United States, well over\u00a095% of your money is sent digitally anyway. People have become very well conditioned and trained, like dogs, to spend their money digitally, not via cash. Most major national economic powers have 80+% of their people using plastic or computers to spend their cash. Famously, countries like\u00a0Sweden are pretty much removing cash from their systems outright this year. A nice beta test that will be scaled up in larger nations in the years to come.\nGovernments won\u2019t have to spend billions of dollars, pounds, or yuan to protect large sums of paper assets in banks, print paper currency, and redesign it to prevent counterfeiting every few years. The entire economy becomes centralized and controlled by one entity. Endless taxes. They can tell you any propaganda they want about why your benefits were slashed this month. What are you gonna do about it?\nBanks can charge you any fees they want since they will have no competition. You can\u2019t pull your money out of the bank since all the money is their digital code. They would have nothing to give you, even if they wanted to give you \u201cyour money.\u201d \u00a0Their money is their money and your money is their money. It\u2019s like that right now, but that is the real end game.\nReason #4 - Their economic model has failed\nI shouldn\u2019t need to tell you your economy is in trouble. You should know this better than I would. It really doesn't matter what country you\u2019re in, chances are you are a part of this global recession. You\u2019ve heard of the scourge of negative interest rates from central bankers sweeping the globe. This is a tacit way of admitting that Keynesian economics is a complete and utter failure for society, unless you are a banker, then it is pretty damn awesome.\nYour economy is in trouble because Keynesian economics built around central planning and manipulating the economy is a total failure, at least for anyone not standing at the top of the economic pyramid. The Austrian, free-market economic model is the greatest system man has ever experienced. This is what was used to build the United States into the world\u2019s greatest superpower throughout most of the 20th century, creating the greatest new technologies, businesses, and military. The problem is that over the last generation the free-market has been corrupted, mutated, and captured by bankers, regulators, and central planners to control and manipulate the markets instead of allowing for market corrections.\nEverything the central bankers have tried has failed the market. The globalists and collectivists who have orchestrated this financial coup d'etat have won with regulations, higher taxes and protection from competition. They win either way. Their plan either works, or they reset the rules, give kickbacks and favors to their insiders, and make sure that your plan never sees the light of day, literally.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-social-e-commerce-can-solve-problems-of-decentralized-markets", "title": " How Social E-Commerce Can Solve Problems of Decentralized Markets ", "content": "Decentralized marketplaces are one of the many rapidly evolving businesses in the fintech industry. To get a first-hand account of the major challenges and opportunities here, Cointelegraph has got in touch with the developers of the Waterhole service.\nFirst decentralized marketplaces\neBay, set up in 1995, has grown from a part-time hobby of its founder, Pierre Omidyar, to a huge multinational corporation.\nIt was one of the first decentralized marketplaces, with caveats. True, it is run by a central authority, but it allows people from all over the world to trade things with each other at a low commission - which is more decentralization, than any of the legacy auctions can boast.\nBeing one of the first adopters of that trend has allowed eBay to enjoy immense growth and become the 24th most popular website worldwide. And why wouldn\u2019t it?\nIn the old days, if you had something of your own to sell, the available options were far from ideal.\nYou could set up a yard sale, hoping that a potential buyer interested in the stuff you had on offer would pass by your house and pay attention, which could ultimately lead to a sale at a large discount.\nOr, you could open a stand at the local flea market and sit there all day, eagerly waiting for a customer, who could never come at all.\nNow people have eBay, where they can list their goods from the comfort of their own home in a matter of seconds, and forget about them. Later, the system conveniently notifies them that there is a buyer, and all that\u2019s left to do is make the shipment and receive the money.\nInadequate moderation\nIt\u2019s no wonder that these advantages translated into huge success for the company. But technology is always advancing, constantly enabling new possibilities and giving birth to new trends. And one principal direction the digital marketplaces are headed in right now, is further decentralization.\nWhile eBay is not going anywhere, any time soon, we may still see strong competition from smaller companies, who embrace new ideas at a much faster speed than a giant corporation could ever hope to achieve.\nOne of the main criticisms leveled at eBay is its inadequate moderation of its own listings. Users are constantly reporting inaccurate, incomplete, or outright fake listings of goods by sellers. eBay has its own guidelines for such instances, but they are rarely enforced, which leads to regular buyers having to sift through tens, or even hundreds of items, until they find what they are looking for. And even then, there is no guarantee that the deal will be completed. There were instances where the buyers have received the purchased goods, and then falsely reported the opposite, with eBay eagerly refunding the money at the expense of the seller.\nA social solution\nAn obvious solution to this is hiring more people to rigorously track and moderate every listing which appears on the site. However, that solution is unfeasible on a large scale, when thousands of new items are being listed every minute. So the next favorable option is giving the users more control over how the deal is done - making it easier for them to determine the quality of the deals on their own.\nOne creative solution, with which that can be achieved, is integrating a social platform into the marketplace. eBay is a pure marketplace - trading goods is all there is to it. Which means that there is little connection between the actual people behind those deals. By making the connection between the goods and the person selling it more tangible, a platform could increase the quality of deals immensely.\nThat is exactly the approach taken by several companies operating in the crypto industry. Take a look at Waterhole, for example. Originally a Bitcoin trading and escrow platform with an integrated decentralized messenger feature, its developers are now working on adding a decentralized marketplace to it. By virtue of already having a functional chat, with the possibility of sending image and video files, Waterhole allows its users to maintain much more close contact with each other. The buyer can always ask the seller to send them a picture or a video of a given item, and receive instant answers.\nJason Nguyen, the COO of Waterhole, comments on this development: \u201cThe social e-commerce is a major movement right now. We see lots of small business owners build incredible reputations in the local communities: car dealers, plumbers, remodel workers, etc. A similar thing is happening on the Internet but it\u2019s still in the early stage. In China, the largest social platform is WeChat, and some pro-sellers used it and outperformed their own sales on Alibaba, due to the instant messaging feature which allows for better communication between sellers and buyers. All that despite WeChat not originally being designed for commerce.\u201d\nMoreover, by having the buyers pay for the goods in Bitcoins (whose transactions are irreversible), the sellers can be confident that there is no potential for fraud in the form of payment reversal, after the goods have been shipped and received.\nLaissez-faire\nAnother important benefit of decentralization is the lack of government interference. The infamous case of Silk Road comes to mind. This was a digital black market which operated in the dark web and specialized in illegal goods, such as drugs and firearms.\nAn FBI investigation into Silk Road was launched almost immediately after it had achieved significant popularity, which led to all its assets being seized by the government, Ross Ulbricht, its alleged founder, being sent to jail, and the service being shut down.\nOne can make an argument that this is not the way to go - despite the illegality of some of the goods that were traded on the market, and the possibility of someone purchasing them with a foul intent, any free person should still be able to decide for themselves if they want to make a purchase, if it does not directly harm others.\nIn this perspective, the decentralized marketplaces are the embodiment of the free market philosophy, even in their very name. Projects such as OpenBazaar or Slur are based on peer-to-peer algorithms and use Bitcoin to conduct payments.\nGiven their decentralized nature, it would be much more difficult for the government to interfere with the operation of these services, or even shut them down, when compared to highly centralized legacy services.\nWaterhole COO on the current challenges\nHowever, using Bitcoin has its own downsides - mainly, the coin\u2019s fluctuating value. All goods on OpenBazaar are listed with prices in Bitcoins, which means that something that\u2019s worth $20 today, could cost $15 or $25 tomorrow.\nThere are measures, however, which can be taken to address this issue. Waterhole, for one, gives its users the option to anchor the price of their goods to either Bitcoin or fiat, the latter option allowing for more stable pricing and safe deals.\nIn order to give you a better understanding of the industry of decentralized marketplaces, Cointelegraph has got in touch with Jason Nguyen, the COO of Waterhole, who gave us a first-hand account of how things work.\nCointelegraph: What stage of development is your marketplace in at the moment? How soon will the users be able to freely trade any goods they wish?\nJason Nguyen: The marketplace has been developed and is fully functional though we are always striving to improve the user experience as well as implement new features that would benefit both buyers and sellers.\nCT: What are some of the major challenges when building a decentralized marketplace, from a technical, legal and economical perspectives?\nJN: When building a decentralized marketplace, there are always hurdles and challenges that must be overcome. From a technical standpoint, the marketplace itself has to be able to be built upon strict security protocols since digital currencies are being implemented and goods are sold either in person or shipped to the buyer.\nFrom a legal standpoint, the marketplace has to be regulated by its users as well as by the administrators in order to prevent illegal abuses such as narcotics and weaponries. By flagging posts by the users and having an actual person reviewing the advertisement, it would help prevent and curb any illicit activities from being encouraged.", "birthday": "2016-09-14T13:46:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-14 12:46:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 14}

", "content": "According to a recent survey by the Bitcoin Marketing Team, the digital currency is still largely dominated by men in their early 20s to their late 40s, with a few under the age of 18.\nCointelegraph caught up with Charlene Chen, BitPesa Chief Operating Officer, Stephanie Kent, founder of Krypton, and Susanne Tempelhof, BitNation founder and CEO, to find out what their views are on women in Bitcoin.\nThe Bitcoin community has a diversity problem\nHere\u2019s one striking figure: 91.8 percent of respondents are male. To paint a demographic picture of the community, the team has surveyed 770 digital currency users from 68 countries. Only 5.7 percent of responses came from women with 2.5 percent choosing not to specify their sex.\nIt shows that more needs to be done to attract women into the niche community of Bitcoin users. While the survey may have only attracted a small number of female respondents that\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t women in Bitcoin making their mark on the community.\nYou only have to look at the likes of Elizabeth Rossiello of BitPesa, Ola Doudin of BitOasis, Stephanie Kent of Krypton and Susanne Tempelhof of Bitnation, to name a few, to see that positive changes are taking place to bridge the gender imbalance in Bitcoin.\nFemale participation in computer science declines\nA report by NPR in 2014 demonstrated that in 1984 the percentage of women in computer science plunged despite the number of women in technical and professional fields such as medicine, law, and physical sciences continued to rise.\nAccording to the report, one of the reasons behind this was that computers began appearing in U.S. homes and were being marketed as \u2018toys for boys,\u2019 leading to a generation of men who gained more exposure and experience with computers at an early age.\nCharlene Chen, COO at BitPesa, says that she was lucky to get involved with computer science. With no brothers to contend with, her dad encouraged her to play around with computers at an early age.\nChen notes:\n \u201cI was one of only five women out of 140 classmates (3.6 percent) who graduated with a Computer Science degree in 2003.\u201d \nShe adds, though, that it\u2019s only human nature to be attracted to what people are familiar with:\n \u201cI\u2019m confident that if a group of men and women had equal exposure to/familiarity with a particular technology, they would be equally successful in implementing/managing that technology.\u201d \nAttracting more women to Bitcoin\nWith a steady decline in female participation in the coding arts and many of the early adopters being male, there may be the assumption that women won\u2019t have an impact in the Bitcoin community.\nSusanne Tempelhof, Founder and CEO of BitNation, disagrees. She says:\n \u201cWomen stand for a significant part of day-to-day expenditures. I believe more women using Bitcoin for daily spending would help stabilize the price.\u201d \n\nStephanie Kent, Krypton founder and CEO, agrees underlining that \u201cwomen have more purchasing power than ever before.\u201d Steps, however, need to be taken to attract more women to the Bitcoin community.\nOne way of doing this, Chen explains, is by featuring more women who are already leading Bitcoin and blockchain companies which will help to attract more women to Bitcoin.\nChen adds:\n \u201cThe Bitcoin community will attract more people, not just women, but men too, if we show how Bitcoin and Blockchain is relevant in both developed and developing countries.\u201d \nShe states that there have been plenty of people she has met who aren\u2019t involved with Bitcoin simply because they don\u2019t understand why they would ever use it.\nTempelhof explains that user-friendly and aesthetically attractive frontend applications would increase adoption as most wallets and exchanges are designed for a male tech audience.\nHowever, while women are involved in the Bitcoin community, the reception they receive is not always welcoming.\nThis amusing, but insightful post by Arianna Simpson, who writes a blog about her Bitcoin experiences and is an active advocate for women in cryptocurrency highlights what it\u2019s like for women who attend Bitcoin meetups.\nWhat struggles do women face in Bitcoin?\nAs with many areas of gender inequality, a need for change on a small scale demonstrates that more needs to be done for change at a higher level. Until the privileged role of early adopters is questioned, many women already making their mark on the Bitcoin community will continue to face struggles based on their gender.\nInterestingly enough, some women make their gender a key part of their identities in Bitcoin such as the Bitcoin wife; however, not all women think their gender should come into it.\nTempelhof says:\n \u201cOne of the things that upsets me as a woman in the Bitcoin industry is when people ask things like, \u2018we want you to be on this panel because we want more women present. So people want me for my gender, not for my ideas, knowledge or achievements?\u201d \nIn Tempelhof\u2019s view, this so-called \u2018positive discrimination\u2019 is just as offensive as plain and simple gender discrimination.\nKrypton\u2019s Stephanie Kent explained that she was recently trolled by a man on BitcoinTalk after he found her personal phone number and home address.\nKent notes:\n \u201cHe continued to post these, obviously butthurt by Krypton\u2019s decision to protect other investors and move away from the Ethereum-based chain to a Bitcoin-based chain as a temp solution.\u201d ", "birthday": "2016-09-09T15:50:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-09 14:50:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 9}

With its applications so far, can we say that the Blockchain has lived up to expectations?\nSome experts think it\u2019s overhyped, others see that late 2016/2017 will be the year of explosion for real-world Blockchain profitability and usage. That is, as long as politics doesn\u2019t get in the way.\nWhat is Blockchain identity?\nBlockchain identity is also defined by Christopher Bates of Bitland as the representation of a\u00a0100% verifiable identity which can be established through a series of security layers and protocols. It is a system which makes it possible for encryption to prevent anyone who doesn\u2019t need to see information from accessing it. \u00a0\nBates explains that this can be applied when working with government oversight, where Blockchain identity could be used to protect Social Security accounts from being pilfered by governments who have overspent on their own budgets. \u00a0\nBates says:\n \u201cOne of the biggest issues is that tax money has no oversight once collected, and something like Blockchain identity could help prevent governments from spending taxpayer\u2019s money which wasn\u2019t theirs.\u201d \nUnique opportunity for Bitcoin\u2019s Blockchain\nBlockchain identity, according to Carl A. R. Weir CEO at Aten Group, is an unequivocal immutability for identity in any interlinked electronic mechanism. Weir says that the convergence from 2014/15 of Mobile/Blockchain/Cloud Computing & Fabric/ IoT have presented a unique opportunity for Blockchain identity to really come to the fore, whether that be in the guise of \u00a0Bitcoin Blockchain usage, Ethereum smart contracts or Hyperledger of Eris.\nBlockchain identity is based on consensus\nAccording to Bates, the Blockchain isn\u2019t the first crowd-computing project, and it isn\u2019t the first experiment with distributed computing systems and ledgers. However, the reason that Blockchain identity is unique is because consensus is the basis of identity in many ways. \u00a0Bates explains that when using the Blockchain a person or organization\u2019s identity is not one-sided. Whatever a person or organization expresses as its identity also has to be verified by at least one party to be accepted as the true identity. Bates gives a real life example, saying:\n \u201cIf you lose your driver\u2019s license, birth certificate, and any state-issued identification, good luck getting a bank account, boarding a plane, or crossing a national border. Having a \u201cdigital\u201d and \u201cdistributed\u201d consensus-based identity would make it much more difficult for a person to accidentally destroy their own identity.\u201d \nAnother aspect of the uniqueness of Blockchain identity, as explained by Weir, is that the immutable ID of a Blockchain is per block, per action, per transaction. In addition, it is the encryption that the Blockchain brings which assures uncorrupted identity, and an inability to allow bad actors to change, remove, edit, identity, falsify records or transactions.\nIs Blockchain overhyped?\nSome think that the Blockchain as a whole is an overhyped concept which has not lived up to expectations. This is a perception which is also shared by Bates who says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cI think a lot of the Blockchain is overhyped. \u00a0The remittance industry has been the biggest overhyped area besides \u201cThe DAO.\u201d \u00a0What happens is that the remittance Blockchain rhetoric talks about how Bitcoin is going to save the Third World, but it fails to actually understand or solve the problems that also come with converting \u201cBitcoin\u201d into \u201cgroceries\u201d locally in the Third World. \u00a0The people spouting the most hyperbolic rhetoric are the ones who will be the last to actually go into Third World countries and \u201cimplement infrastructure\u201d to support Bitcoin. \u00a0They will travel in The West and in Europe to talk about it, but let\u2019s see how many of them will actually be going to Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Mauritius, Cameroon, or Sierra Leone in the next year.\u201d \n2016-17 will see a Blockchain explosion\nContrary to this opinion, Weir retains the view that rather than a hype, there has been an overenthusiastic use case attribution in one direction - banking. He thinks that there are other sectors which could have scaled growth much more quickly and made Blockchain technology advances further down the line than they currently are.\nHe says:", "birthday": "2016-09-10T13:30:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-10 12:30:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 10}

This is rather like how cars are updated. A new car is redesigned every five years or so, and three years later they get some navigation system updates, a new grille, and maybe some increased \u00a0horsepower. The banking industry is certainly not getting redesigned, and the last time they had an engineering overhaul was way back when in the dot-com era, when online banking was added a generation ago.\nBanks are never at the cutting edge, consistently being five to ten years behind the curve. Now, one international mega-bank, Santander, admits that one of banking's biggest assets, the fifty-year-old debit/credit card concept is in danger from the superior online payment technology known as\u00a0Bitcoin.\nConsumers win when banks compete\nCompetition is one of nature\u2019s greatest concepts. Whether it is sports, business, or a fight for life in the jungles of Africa, only the strongest survive. Due to regulatory capture, this is not how banking works as centralized banking around the world is pretty much the only game in town, until 2009, when Bitcoin was invented.

Instead, this functionality supposedly lies behind \u201cunlocking\u201d cities by building a critical mass of support from potential riders and drivers.\nChristopher David, CEO of Arcade City, explains the reason behind initially restricting the functionality:\n \u201cAustin is on track to being unlocked probably by Wednesday of this week. The ball is in their court, so we'll see. Two things are needed to unlock a city: sufficient 'city karma points' representing the connectedness of a new rideshare community, and a constitution describing the leaders' vision for Arcade City in their area and their processes for self-governing. We want to make sure our cities are set up to be self-sustaining, not relying on the HQ for anything other than the mobile app.\u201d \nWhile it will soon be two weeks since the app\u2019s original release without a single city featuring ridesharing functionality, David expects this to change soon:\n \u201cAustin has already done most of the work we expect from new cities, so they should be just days away from getting drivers on the road using our new app. Our Austin team leaders are preparing a report on the successful partnership with Unsung.org, and that's going to result in a flood of \u2018karma points\u2019 into the system. They are holding a meeting in the next few days to draft their city constitution.\u00a0 It should be exciting to watch, and will definitely help other cities to follow in their footsteps. And we think the flood of \u2018karma\u2019 into Austin, combined with our commission-based referral system, will incentivize our Austin trail-blazers to help other cities set up their networks too. There should be a pretty quick domino effect of cities unlocking over the next month. We expect active ridesharing networks in 100+ cities and 10+ countries using our app for rides by the end of the year.\u201d \n\nA gamified \u2018karma\u2019 system: community building, or a ruse?\nThe system of building \u2018karma points\u2019 as a precursor to app functionality is not typically part of a ridesharing companies\u2019 strategy.\nAccording to Neal Conner, who assisted David in the Free Uber activism campaign before Arcade City was founded, sees forcing users to play games for points as a way to stall for time:\n \"'Unlocking\u2019 is a tactic that would have us doing significant marketing work for the company with no guarantee of an actual payoff. I doubt there's anything existing in the app that we're not seeing: so far it's been a stalling tactic, if, and when, ridesharing functionality is actually built. Every screen in the app makes promises of things 'coming soon.\u2019 I'd frankly be embarrassed to refer anyone to it.\u201d \nAs of the time of writing, no city, including Arcade City\u2019s busy epicenter of Austin, has accumulated the necessary points to achieve functionality.\nDavid maintains that the system is working as intended:\n \u201cThe \u2018karma\u2019 system merely reflects the willingness of individuals and cities to engage in the kinds of community organizing we\u2019ve seen to be successful in Austin. We know Austin was definitely a special case, so we don\u2019t expect that level of activity from all cities.\u201d \nAccording to David, the involved point system is intended to foster a functioning community before debuting the service in a given city:\n \u201cAt the minimum we seek to identify cities with enough dedicated Arcadians willing to put in place the guidelines and support structures needed to provide reliable service.

Institute Asks if Bitcoin Threatens Paper Money ", "content": "Could Bitcoin run the world in the future, instead of the current fiat currency system? \u00a0SWIFT thought enough of this question to study the idea in-depth.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy, the Earth gets more solar power from the sun in a single hour than humanity uses in an entire year. Yet, solar power only provided 0.39% of the energy used in the US last year. Why? Because the world runs on hazardous, inefficient, primitive oil. Why? Because the countries, governments, and businesses of the world want it that way to control the use of money, energy and systems on the planet. Solar energy is a far better, safer, and a much more efficient energy system, but the world will never use it at scale. This is not an accident. This is by design.\nWhy do I bring that subject up on a\u00a0Bitcoin news site? The question of how the world uses energy is a microcosm of the way the world turns in many different industries and globalized systems. The only other global system which is as important as how the world gains and uses energy is the monetary system. Do you see any similarities in the world\u2019s current monetary policy? I would argue that it is the other side of the same coin. Virtually identical in design, and control.\nThe world uses a fiat currency system, managed by central bankers in virtually every nation in the world. The Federal Reserve in the United States, and the Bank of England pulling the main strings, deciding just how fast the world goes round. No fiat, or paper money on the planet has any actual, intrinsic value.\nThere haven\u2019t been gold standards in over 40 years. Central banks alone control the amount of money in circulation, and can print, or debase, any currency if they so choose. They are in total control of the concept of money. Your job, as a ward of the state, is to accept and buy into this controlled banker-led, government-approved system. Is that the best system the world can come up with? Of course not, but it is what we have, and again, this by design. This is no accident.\nBitcoin is a look into how the future of money could, and, some say, should work. Decentralized, anti-inflationary, global, not national, with no corruptable, controllable \u201cmaster of ceremonies,\u201d if you will, manipulating the system to the advantage of unknown parties behind the curtain. Could Bitcoin run the world in the future, instead of the current fiat currency system? It is not designed to do so, but one of the world\u2019s largest establishment monetary banking systems,\u00a0SWIFT, thought enough of this question to study the idea in-depth, through their SWIFT Institute.\nSomebody is hearing footsteps\nThe SWIFT Institute is labeled as a group which \u201cfosters independent research to extend the understanding of current practices and future needs across the financial industry.\u201d \u00a0Yet, it is managed and paid for by SWIFT, so is it really \u201cindependent research?\u201d With that clarification of the true narrative out of the way, they have chosen to create a 33-page report called \u201cVIRTUAL CURRENCIES: MEDIA OF EXCHANGE OR SPECULATIVE ASSET?.\u201d\nThis official SWIFT research paper analyzes Bitcoin and its essential relevance throughout the global economic system, both now and in the future. So what did they find out? KiHoon Hong, who helped create the report for SWIFT, provides a succinct synopsis of their findings.\nKiHoon Hong, Hongik University College of Business, says:\n \"Contrary to conventional wisdom, our research shows that fiat currencies crowd out Bitcoin, not the reverse and that the design and size of the Bitcoin market deprive the currency of its intended use as a medium of exchange. What is also evident is that Bitcoin poses minimal risk to financial or monetary stability. Despite this, if the acceptance of Bitcoin or other virtual currencies increases significantly on a global scale, it could have significant consequences on the relevance of monetary policy, as its decentralized and independent nature makes regulatory oversight difficult.\u201d \nThe link to the full report is above if you want to review it in its entirety, but the actual report is of little importance to me. Asking an icon of the economic establishment if the new online currency will one day remove them from power is like asking Hillary Clinton if she should use her own servers for emails. Something as powerful and incumbent as the SWIFT network is only going to see what they want to see, and will look to control everything else.", "birthday": "2016-09-07T10:25:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-07 09:25:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 7}

In particular, he referred to the outdated services and products of banks which grant several financial institutions a complete monopoly over a country\u2019s monetary system and economy.\nControl of banks: bloated economy\nThe focus of the talk was established primarily on the control of banks over a country\u2019s monetary systems and how that is abused to create a bloated economy.\nWhen an economy is struggling from dealing with financial instability or poor performance from major stock markets, the solution which is often presented by the central bank is to print more money. For instance, the Federal Reserve Bank would print trillions of dollars to be sprinkled on top of a troubling economy which is essentially distributed to the country\u2019s banks and government agencies.\nOne major misconception behind this theory of quantitative easing is that trillions of dollars will eventually reach every business, individual, and organization at the bottom of the economy. What actually ends up happening is that the top 1% benefit from this illegitimate distribution of money and others become negatively affected by the rising inflation rates.

A soft fork requires only a majority of the miners to upgrade to the network rules or face security reduction.\nCentralization\nThe centralization issue emerges during the process of submitting and implementing a soft fork into the network. When a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal is presented to the few Bitcoin Core developers led by BIP editor Luke Dashjr, the developers decide on a majority consensus whether to accept the soft fork and to implement it into the Bitcoin network.\nGarzik heavily criticized the Segregated Witness proposal for the same reason in his Bitcoin Status Report presentation at the OnChain Scaling Conference on August 30, stating that SegWit is ruled by a tiny and a few technocratic elite.\nGarzik said:\n \u201cSoft forks very specifically, from an average user point of view , cannot be considered opt-in because the entire network is locked into the new consensus rule, regardless or not.\u201d \nHe further emphasized that if soft forks tend to be controversial, it is extremely difficult to reverse and challenge. \u201cControversial soft forks are difficult to reverse or challenge.

", "content": "Glenbrook and PSCU have released a white paper \u201cBlockchain and the Credit Union - The Asset Transfer Revolution.\u201d The authors hope that this white paper will shape the future use of the Blockchain in the credit union industry.\nPSCU has been providing traditional as well as online services to credit unions, representing at least 800 credit unions. Glenbrook is a payment\u00a0industry strategy consulting and research firm.\nCredit unions have an important role to play in the world of finance. They are a service provider whose primary motivation is the satisfaction of their members, rather than profiteering. Keeping up to date with technology can help those credit unions who are based on the co-operative movement stay relevant.\nBlockchain governance is a sticking point\nThe white paper discusses the various features and benefits of the Blockchain, examining the way the Bitcoin Blockchain is functioning. They believe that while the Blockchain system by itself is \u201cresilient to faults\u201d the important question is \u201cWho manages the Blockchain for the long term?\u201d\nThe white paper states:\n \u201cThe Bitcoin experience is a case in point. While the software does its transaction processing tasks reliably, the decision-making process around upgrades to that software and the overall evolution of the Bitcoin system is nearly broken. Decision-making is shared by a handful of software engineers who are unable to agree. This has led to a planning stalemate which remains unresolved.\u201d \nThis imbriglio, according to the authors of the white paper, make this type of governance model untenable. The paper is clear that some human intervention is useful in a commercial setting.\nBlockchain has a wide swathe of applications for credit unions\nAs far as credit unions are concerned, the white paper has narrowed down a number of real world applications where Blockchain technology can successfully be applied. The paper identifies relatively simpler applications such as P2P transactions to complex products such as Clearing/Settlement, and Smart contracts etc. Some of the user cases that they have covered are:\n Person-to-Person Payments (P2P): The paper has looked into Bitcoin as a P2P means of processing payments but notes that there are bottlenecks. \nIt states:\n \u201cConnecting the Bitcoin currency to a dollar-denominated account (or any other currency denominated account in other geographies) has been a challenge because simply buying Bitcoin is an awkward and complicated process.\u201d \n Remittances and Payments: This is a bit of a reinvention of the wheel as the paper notes that existing services are covering this base well. However, they do take the example of Circle which acts as an intermediary and processes international transactions in Bitcoin without clients ever having to interact with Bitcoin itself. Financial Institution Settlements: This is perhaps the most interesting of all the Blockchain applications. Large scale transaction settlements utilising the Blockchain across financial institutions can help credit unions compete with the big boys. The white paper cites the case of the R3 CEV consortium. \nIt says:\n \u201cThe R3 CEV consortium, for example, offers its more than 50 global members the chance to evaluate the collaborative use of a distributed ledger mechanism for interbank settlement and the trading of various assets such as stocks and bonds.\u201d ", "birthday": "2016-09-07T12:50:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-07 11:50:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 7}

This is likely to enhance the sending of money to some parts of the world, including its recent market in China using Apple's messaging system as a carrier.\nFor Circle adding payments to iMessage reduces \u201cthe friction,\u201d for consumers, says CEO Jeremy Allaire.\nHe adds:\n \u201cThere\u2019s a hurdle to have to install a smartphone app so that I can pay my buddy and all the inputting and set up. To do it all within the iMessages app is a lot easier.\u201d \nThough Apple has not yet revealed whether it will support ETC, the continuing chain of the original Ethereum, Jaxx says it has submitted an updated version of its app to the\u00a0iOS App Store\u00a0and hopes that it will be approved in the next few days.\nDi Iorio noted in a release that Jaxx will be forced to remove Dash from the iOS versions of its wallet on September 14, 2016. Since the hard forked version of Ethereum has already been approved by Apple, they hope that \u201cApple will allow the addition of Ethereum Classic, especially given its wide array of developer support and steadily growing popularity.\u201d\nIn last week\u2019s Apple-issued directive, six tokens were identified as supported: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, the DAO and Ripple.\nThe integration will make ETC, being the sixth most valuable Blockchain token by market cap valued at $124 million, be available on seven of the nine platforms Jaxx supports with approval pending on the iOS App Store for iPhone and iPad users.\nEthereum Classic could be next\nIt won\u2019t be a problem if Apple doesn't permit Ethereum Classic on its iOS products because it will still exist on Jaxx's other seven platforms, Di lorio noted in an email to Cointelegraph. He says Apple is now seeing that there is strong demand for other tokens and Jaxx is looking forward to its clarification on how best to integrate these coins for iPhone and iPad users.\nOn whether ETC will still be valuable despite claims that the stolen DAO fund is being moved,\u00a0Di lorio said that Jaxx isn't speculating on the value or price of certain coins but are simply providing options and choice to its growing list of consumers.", "birthday": "2016-09-08T14:40:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-08 13:40:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 8}

To stay relevant, match up to competition, exercise control or defeat existing crypto?\n Why banks develop their own digital currencies? \u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) September 7, 2016\n\nAccording to the Cointelegraph twitter quiz, over 46% of participants think that banks develop their own cryptocurrencies so they can exercise control.\nIn a patent application filed October 30, 2014, but published only recently, Goldman, Sachs & Co. has made a claim of having developed a new cryptographic currency called SETLcoin that will be held in electronic wallets.\nAccording to the description made in the application:\n \u201cThe wallet has the technology to generate, manipulate, and store a new cryptographic currency, referred to as SETLcoins, for exchanging assets, such as securities (e.g., stocks, bonds, etc.) cash, and/or cash equivalents via a peer-to-peer network.\u201d \nBanks are all in for crypto\nIt seems that the banks have placed all their chips on cryptocurrency. Goldman Sachs has come up with its own flavour and Citibank, too, has a variant called Citicoin.\nIn August, the four big boys of banking namely UBS, Deutsche Bank, Santander and BNY Mellon joined forces to develop their own digital money.\nThe Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ \u00a0(MUFJ) is also planning to launch its own digital money according to The Asahi Shimbun and they might actually be the first one to debut this currency around Autumn 2017.\nBitcoin has proven to work\nIt seems that the technology behind Bitcoin has now been proven to work. The real world scenario of Bitcoin adoption is a factor which is pushing up confidence in cryptocurrencies and the Blockchain tech behind it. The idea that costs can be cut down and the transmission of money made easier for interbank settlements, as well as P2P transactions, holds sex appeal for these big banks.\nAs the Asahi Shimbun reports while talking about the MUFG coin:\n \u201cThe MUFG coin system will work much like prepaid electronic money, such as \u201cSuica,\u201d already widely used in Japan. However, users will be able to remit MUFG coins to others through the Internet at a low commission. The MUFG coins will make it easier, for example, for customers to equally share a bill whilst out drinking or dining.\u201d \nAn elegant solution\nBlockchain was initially perceived as an existential threat by the bankers and now their attitude seems to have turned to, \u201cif you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, join \u2018em.\u201d\nIt is a clever move on the part of the bankers because they know that once they step into the game and start issuing their own coins, regulations will have to be brought in and they will apply equally to existing currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoins. Essentially this can be seen as a hijack bid.\nBesides this, banks can get rid of the outdated\u00a0correspondent banking systems like SWIFT in one fell swoop, so for them controlling transactions makes even more sense by hitting two birds with one stone. An elegant solution.\nPatents to the right of them, patents to the left of them\nIn February 2016, American Banker reported that the Bank of America is seeking 20 more Blockchain-related patents in addition to the 15 they had previously filed in 2014. The whole patent business was described as a \u201crace to the courthouse\u201d by Carol Van Cleef, partner at the law firm Manatt Phelps & Phillips in the American Banker article.", "birthday": "2016-09-08T16:47:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-08 15:47:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 8}

Over that time, life has never been boring for young Bitcoin, with the digital currency becoming extremely popular throughout the criminal and online underworld, as well as the more tech-savvy and economically progressive among us. \u00a0\nToday, we\u2019ll review the top five moments in Bitcoin\u2019s rather spectacular history. Not the five best moments, nor the five worst, but the five greatest moments in Bitcoin history that have left a mark, not just on the Bitcoin community but on the world, starting with number five.\n#5 - The Pizza Purchase (May 22nd, 2010)\nA tasty place to start. Clearly the most publicly noteworthy transaction in early Bitcoin history, if not the most significant. Jacksonville, Florida programmer Laszlo Hanyecz\u00a0negotiated a deal with a Bitcoin Talk forum member in the U.K. to take\u00a010,000 Bitcoin he had mined for $30 in Papa John\u2019s pizza. This would make a Bitcoin worth less than $0.01 USD at the time. Today, those Bitcoins would be worth over $5.7 million USD. This single transaction proved to the world that Bitcoin had a mainstream monetary value for the first time.\nHanyecz told Cointelegraph:\n \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like Bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool. No one knew it was going to get so big.\u201d \n\n- Image provided by Mashable.\n#4 - Bitcoin to the Moon (November 2013)\nBitcoin had been making some waves in Spring 2013, quickly growing tenfold in value since the start of the year. The summer was tranquil in market trading, as per usual. Yet, during the movement in the fall of that year would not just change the Bitcoin community\u2019s view of Bitcoin but would also put Bitcoin on the global map as a blue-chip investment, at least for a week or two.\nFrom the start of October through to the end of November, Bitcoin pricing exploded from approximately $125 USD\u00a0to over $1200 USD, forcing the world to take notice of what some called \u201cThe Future of Money.\u201d\nThere are many factors in this \u201cBitcoin to the Moon\u201d market bubble, including the release of Bitcoin to the Chinese market and some manipulative practices at the still dominant Mt. Gox exchange which would lead to its demise. But the bubble started to burst in December 2013, and would not fully correct itself until January 2015 when prices bottomed out at under $180 USD.\n#3 - Microsoft Approved (December 11th, 2014)\nIn association with the Bitcoin merchant account processor BitPay,\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s website began to accept Bitcoin payments for digital goods. The amount of Bitcoin that could be used per account was capped at $1000 USD. Microsoft did not make much of a public announcement to promote the move, but they said it took about three months to go from initial concept to implementation.\nEric Lockard, corporate vice-president of Universal Store at Microsoft at the time, said:\n \u201cThe use of digital currencies such as Bitcoin, while not yet mainstream, is growing beyond the early enthusiasts. We expect this growth to continue and allowing people to use Bitcoin to purchase our products and services now allows us to be at the front edge of that trend.\u201d \n#2 - The Fall of Mt. Gox (February 7th, 2014)\nMt. Gox had a profoundly positive effect on the growth of Bitcoin as a global \u00a0currency. It was the origin of any type of official Bitcoin market valuation. It might as well have been the First International Bank of Bitcoin, at one time in early 2013 handling more than 70% of all Bitcoin transactions worldwide. Just like with a bricks-and-mortar commercial bank, Bitcoin users treated Mt. Gox the same way, trusting their entire account to Mark Karpeles and the rest of the company to handle.\n\n- Image provided by Techcrunch.\nWell, as with any Bitcoin exchange, there is a large amount of exchange risk involved. Whoever holds the Bitcoin\u2019s private keys owns those Bitcoins, and Mt. Gox successfully traded over 150,000 BTC per day and held well over a million Bitcoins at its peak. After months of shaky price discrepancies with other exchanges, and accounting practices that could not be explained, on February 7th, 2014, Mt. Gox would no longer accept Bitcoin withdrawals.", "birthday": "2016-09-01T14:30:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-01 13:30:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 1}

The Tapscotts are co-authors of the book - Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business and the World. The 3-day Blockchain huddle included the participants:\n Brian Behlendorf, Founder, The Hyperledger Project Perianne Boring, Founder and President, The Chamber of Digital Commerce Michael Dillhyon, CEO, YouBase Inc.

Cointelegraph talked with Alex Tapscott of The Tapscott Group at whose residence the group was formed.\nHe says:\n \u201cBlockchain technology has emerged as the second generation of the Internet and has the potential to transform business and society in profound and potentially positive ways, yet the ecosystem today is still in its infancy. Specifically, there are many challenges we face that must be overcome - everything from standards to advocacy, policy and education.\u201d \nBuilding a chain of trust\nThe Bitfury Group will have a key role in the plans of the Muskoka Group to build trust in Blockchain systems. They plan to collaborate and act collectively to this end. A part of the strategy of the group is to support the Blockchain Trust Accelerator.\nJamie Smith, Global Chief Communications Officer of The Bitfury Group expresses the need to create better governance models when talking about the Blockchain Trust Accelerator:\n \u201cThe goal of the Blockchain Trust Accelerator is to connect public servants with technologists and funders to accelerate the adoption of Blockchain technology for social good and democratic governance. Support of the Blockchain Trust Accelerator, another Bitfury initiative, was also a priority for the individuals who gathered at Muskoka. \u00a0Blockchain technology is innovative, powerful and has the capability to address corruption and make the world better for a lot of people, which is why Bitfury, New America and the National Democratic Institute launched the Blockchain Trust Accelerator.\u201d \nJoining forces with the Hyperledger\nLinux Foundation\u2019s Hyperledger has been at the forefront of the collaborative effort when it comes to Blockchain. The Muskoka Group aims to take advantage of this existing effort.\nWe asked Brian Behlendorf, Founder, The Hyperledger Project about how the Hyperledger might fit in and he expressed his support:\n \u201cWe were excited to be a part of this interesting conversation, and support the statements put out by the collective. The Linux Foundation's expertise with building open source software communities and the surrounding commercial ecosystem will continue to be applied to the Blockchain world through Hyperledger, both in the specific projects we host (Fabric, Sawtooth Lake, Explorer, and more soon) and potentially in the future other services like training, conferences, and the like. \u00a0These services are often essential to growing the developer talent pool, and give those developers a chance to prove their skills to companies searching for those skills. \u00a0If there are other ways we can be of service to the broad Blockchain technology industry using our skills with open source software and communities, we'd love to know.\" \nGathering the community around a hub\nDon and Alex Tapscott have been charged with funding and launching a GSN (Global Solutions Network Program) Blockchain Hub. The function of this hub will be to carry out a research project with the aim of categorisation, analysis and building an inventory of the Blockchain ecosystem as it exists today.\nAlex Tapscott explains the importance of the GSN Blockchain Hub:\n \u201cThe GSN framework for multi-stakeholder governance is the product of a $4mm research project and really is the definitive taxonomy for how global resources, such as the Internet - or in this case, Blockchain \u2013 are governed.\u201d \nAlex Tapscott is of the opinion that the GSN Blockchain Hub could emerge as one of the most important areas of research, knowledge sharing and collaboration in the Blockchain ecosystem.\nBusting the Blockchain myth bubble\nBlockchain has attracted a lot of attention and there is a lot of buzz around it but unfortunately not all of this is positive.\nAccording to Alex Tapscott these misconceptions are getting in the way and in many cases the opposite is true, as he explains:\n \u201cRight now there are too many myths about this technology that need to be busted. For example \u2013 people assume this will only impact on financial services, or that governments are hostile towards it, or that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are only used by criminals. It turns out that not only are those notions false, often the inverse is true.

This agreement was verified and accepted by Bitcoin Core developers, who failed to deliver the hard fork by the agreed time period.\nHowever, as the Bitcoin Core development team began to integrate various innovative scaling solutions like segregated witness, the community seemed to develop more trust in the practical works of the developers, acknowledging their commitment in scaling the Bitcoin network.\nOver time, more start ups and miners expressed their support towards the Bitcoin Core development team, complicating the stance of the Bitcoin community in the block size debate.\nLearning the opinion of the Bitcoin community\nTo evaluate where the majority of the Bitcoin community members and users stand in the argument, Coin Dance released their conclusive data on the survey they had conducted.\nThe official results showed that about 64.28% of the Bitcoin community are in support of the increase in Bitcoin block size. 47.64% of the voters were from /r/btc (pro- hard fork) and 49.79% of the voters came from /r/bitcoin (pro-Bitcoin Core).\nWhile a lot of users complained that the basis of the survey is unidentified and it can\u2019t be used as an actual confirmation to decide where the community currently stands, Coin Dance emphasized that considering the equal distribution of voters between /r/btc and /r/bitcoin, the data collected through the survey is legitimate.\nCoin Dance wrote:\n \u201cWe'd just like to reaffirm that the majority of our users come from /r/bitcoin, not /r/btc.

Proponents of this system advocate it as a mechanism to enable marginalized residents of the world's slums to take out loans using this newly recognized property as collateral.\nThe commodification of people's homes for use as financial instruments was at the heart of the financial crisis of 2008. The correlation between those toxic assets and the Blockchain-based property schemes which are now in the early phases of implementation warrant close scrutiny. Failing to learn the lessons of the last financial meltdown may precipitate another massive disenfranchisement of the world\u2019s most vulnerable citizens.\nLand Grab Mania\nThe financial crisis of 2008 is considered by many economists to have been the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The impetus of this man-made disaster was the securitization of home mortgages which were subsequently arranged into tranches and partitioned on the basis of repayment expectation.\nPredatory lenders issued mortgages to unsuspecting victims in the form of NINJA loans (No Income No Job or Assets). These financial instruments were thrust upon people with no real hope of paying them back and the result was countless families losing their homes when the system imploded in 2008.\nHernando de Soto is President of the Institute for Liberty and Democracy. De Soto espouses the notion that residents of Third World shanties such as the Juhu slums of Mumbai, depicted in the film Slumdog Millionaire, are essentially locked out of global capital markets by their inability to secure credit.\nSlum property rights\nOfficially such people are homeless, lacking governmental title to their domicile. However, the facts on the ground tell a different story. Typically members of these local communities are conscious of one another's de facto property rights, which are acknowledged and respected.\nPrior efforts to establish title to such slum properties have resulted in failure as corrupt officials allocated land rights on the basis of favoritism or influence. The Semantic Blockchain presents an appealing alternative as the consensus mechanism might ensure that a majority of residents would act in good faith and correctly assign addresses.\n\u201cOf the 7.3 billion people in the world, only 2 billion have a title that is legal, effective and public regarding their control over an asset.\u201d remarked De Soto in a public statement. \u201cWhen something is not legally on record as being owned, it can therefore not be used \u2026 as collateral to get credit, as a credential that you can be able to transfer part of your property to invite investment in. Things are owned, but when they\u2019re not adequately paperized or recorded, they cannot fill the functions of creating capital and credit.\u201d\nToxic Assets in the Making\nA collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is a type of structured asset-backed security (ABS). Originally developed for the corporate debt markets, over time CDOs evolved to encompass the mortgage and mortgage-backed security (MBS) markets. In the years leading up to the crash of 2008 some MBS issuers, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, guaranteed against homeowner default risk while requiring private mortgage insurance on loans in which the borrower provided a down payment of less than 20% of the property value.\nDecentralized insurance\nTogether these financial instruments comprised the toxic assets that necessitated the infamous government bailouts which may have been a motivation behind the creation of the world\u2019s first digital currency.", "birthday": "2016-09-04T12:23:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-04 11:23:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 4}

Every day we are on a mission to increase the awareness of the endless opportunities and benefits offered by this innovative technology. We strive to do it by delivering the latest news, breakthroughs and analyses to our loyal readers.\nInterest in the Blockchain is high and growing\nThe best way to \u2018socialize\u2019 and popularize Blockchain is to go to the community. That is why we flew to Helsinki for the first Nordics Blockchain Conference. With the growing interest from developing technology industries in the Blockchain and cryptocurrencies we were certain that the event would attract attention.\nWe were pleasantly surprised, however, to see a full house - more that 200 Blockchain enthusiasts, business and financial technology experts, entrepreneurs, developers, and researchers met at Microsoft Flux, a Finnish startup community space, to discuss current trends and share ideas on the future direction of the Blockchain industry.\nWe were very grateful to see giants like Nordea, Nokia, Microsoft, Citi Bank, FIBAN, Hashflare\u00a0among the supporters of the conference. Seeing such a huge interest helps inspire and drive us further to develop new projects.\nThe story of Blockchain\nThe CTConference was opened by Victoria Vaughan, CEO at Cointelegraph. She talked about the basics of Blockchain technology, its logic and the mechanisms of functioning.\nVaughan shared her enthusiasm about the rapid development of the technology:\n \u201cSeveral years ago Blockchain was known only within a community of geeks occupied with the idea of it alternating the future of money and changing the world. Now we see huge businesses recognizing the potential of Blockchain and getting more and more involved in its development, testing and application in various industries. And this is really cool! \u201d \n\nSpeaking of the scope of diffusion, Blockchain has already offered effective solutions to the challenges which have existed for years in spheres like the provision of public services, identity and KYC, intellectual property and product management, finance and IoT, and social networks.\nIt\u2019s impossible to talk about the many use-cases of Blockchain without giving a concrete example, right? Matej Michalko from DECENT\u00a0took over the stage to talk about many of the benefits that Blockchain brings.\nHe said:\n \u201cOne of the key principles of Blockchain, for which the technology is so highly-valued, is that it allows the elimination of the middleman, it decentralizes operations, and it reduces transaction costs. Until now there was a need for a different kind of middleman to facilitate these services. However, thanks to Blockchain, we can forget about it\u201d. \n\nBringing the positive effects on the processes handling and decentralization, however, sets some challenges. Remembering the DAO case, Matej raised a few important questions with regards to the responsibility for system stability and its sustainability. Matej also shared DECENT\u2019s vision on the application of the technology. Thus, the team has created a secure platform for sharing digital content taking the maximum of the Blockchain to ensure cost-efficiency, privacy and security of the process.\nBlockchain knows no borders\nErik Vollst\u00e4dt, Lead Ambassador at Bitnation, presented a totally mindblowing application of Blockchain. It was embedded to provide the same services that traditional governments provide, but in a geographically unbound, decentralized and voluntary way.\nHe said:\n \u201cWith Blockchain we can choose government services just as we choose our phone provider. Bitnation provides services where we still have monopolies - insurance, social services and security. With Bitnation you can even start your own nation, which anyone can join irrespective of where they live. We are getting closer to becoming world citizens. Blockchain is not only about the money, you can also use it to create new government structures.\u201d \n\nWe live in a world with imaginary lines called borders. Instead of living within these imaginary lines we should be allowed to use government services in a decentralized manner. Erik is certain that by creating a new form of competition it is possible to increase the quality of services to ensure transparency and minimize bureaucracy.", "birthday": "2016-09-05T11:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-05 10:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 5}

It will appear on the blockchain within seconds of being claimed. When that happens, it will alert the client - the legitimate owner of the content.\nSince the technology is designed to make Custos\u2019 core IP identify the \u201coriginal infringer\u201d of the pirated content \u2013 the user who first rips a movie and uploads it, or shares their copy of an e-book on-line, the alert will help determine if the content is being accessed by an unauthorized user.\nThe detection, the company says, it enables media owners to \u201caudit\u201d the media recipients, honour their licenses, and do not distribute the content. Since media recipients know that they can be traced, it provides a very strong disincentive to leak content in the first place.\nThe company\u2019s spokesperson says in an email:\n \u201cHowever, the rapid detection is also valuable to our clients. For example, if a movie owner knows soon enough that a pirate copy of a pre-release screener is already being circulated (but perhaps not visible on the public internet yet), they can take mitigating steps to minimise revenue losses, for example by moving an official release date ahead to avoid the situation where the only publicly available copy of a movie is the pirated one. \nOur system does play nicely with traditional DRM, though it's entirely possible to combine our Bitcoin watermarks with technology (e.g. Microsoft Silverlight) that makes it very difficult to rip and copy the movie in the first place.

The company aims to offer returns through their transparent, realistic and short-term investment plans.\nWith the introduction of cloud mining it became easier to mine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the comfort of your own home without having to invest in huge data centers and the maintenance of hardware.\nGeeks who like building their own systems would certainly go for traditional mining, but users who want to get their hashrate immediately start with alternative cloud mining. It is often considered to be one of the most profitable ways of investing online. However, engaging in cloud mining is accompanied by certain risks.\nMaking money from nothing is questionable, but, as we know, nothing is impossible nowadays. So, how is it possible to multiply Bitcoins?\nVeselik explains:\n \u201cIf multiplying money was this easy, nobody would ever be poor. What is the secret of successful business people? They make the right decisions at the right time. The arrival of Bitcoin has opened a wide variety of opportunities to earn profits. We at Maximus Coin offer our users the possibility of becoming an investor. A person with a minimal budget can invest in the construction of mining plants and earn a good return on profits.\u201d \nTransparency\nA question of trust has been raised before and will remain one of the most widely discussed. Gaining users trust is important for Maximus Coin, which is why the company is focusing on ensuring transparency in all of its operations.\nVeselik says:\n \u201cAs we are investing in cryptocurrency exchange services we are able to offer a higher profit than regular cloud mining companies. To be closer to our customers we are planning to release a mobile app, which is going to be the first one in the cloud mining business. This will allow customers to manage their funds more efficiently.\u201d \nSecurity\nSecurity is perhaps another important thing which worries people who wish to invest in Bitcoin. Recent attacks on the world\u2019s leading Bitcoin exchanges do not make the situation better, but only add to the fear and uncertainty.\nCloud mining companies make a lot of effort to ensure the sustainability of their systems and to protect their users investments.

Investors are looking for 'the next big thing' and these various cryptocurrencies are prone to being quickly inflated on news and bullish sentiment.\" \nWhat the data reveals\nBraveNewCoin pulled data on both Bitcoin and Monero, correlating their relative price against three major events to the cryptocurrency world: Brexit, the Bitfinex hack, and AlphaBay\u2019s XMR integration.\nIn terms of price, Bitcoin received a small dip right before Brexit, but the following \u201cyes\u201d vote caused the price to rebound. Immediately prior to the Bitfinex hack\u2019s announcement, the price began to sharply decline, likely because of all trading over the exchange had stopped. Meanwhile, Monero\u2019s price remained stable until the hack, at which point it began to rise slowly but steadily, gaining over 50% value. Then, the price shot up sharply immediately preceding, and then again after, the AlphaBay announcement. During this time, Bitcoin\u2019s price remained relatively stable and unaffected.\n", "birthday": "2016-09-06T14:40:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-06 13:40:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 6}

Its price was around $640 before the hack.\nThe fact that the rise came after Bitfinex announced\u00a0the redemption of 1.1812% of outstanding BFX tokens also points in the direction of the exchange being a factor for the price swing. Or that it was a reversal to the pre-Bitfinex hack price.\nThe announcement of the Brave Browser implementing Bitcoin micropayments could also be a contributor. The 0.11.6 release of Brave enables users to reward websites they enjoy frequenting while getting rid of tracking and adware techniques at the same time.\nAnother reason might be that the Russian authorities have officially stated there will be no penalties for Bitcoin use. Based on movement on Fiatleak\u00a0around the time of the spike, a Reddit member Midipoet stated:\n \u201cThat's a pretty interesting website. We should have seen this coming. It was only a few days ago that Russia 'legalised' Bitcoin, and there is a LOT of money in Russia. If you factor in the countries that deal with Russia, and the fact that they would want a monetary exchange system that is quicker/cheaper/safer than FIAT, the price rise is actually a no-brainer.\u201d \nOn another thread, timfcrn stated that the rise is as a result of people taking huge profits from other cryptos into Bitcoin, which has forced a massive short squeeze that some miners didn't see.", "birthday": "2016-09-05T18:45:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-05 17:45:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 5}

What is the market sentiment at the moment? Is Bitcoin\u2019s price cheap, compared to the long-term trend?\nThere was no turn to decline yet\nRight before the 11th G20 summit took place in China, Bitcoin\u2019s price went up by almost 10%. Many experts have noted that the yuan is unlikely to escape a new wave of devaulation in 2016. It seems that such news provokes investors into taking up new instruments to diversify.\nAlso, one of the large cryptocurrency trading companies - BitKan - is determined to enter the US market in September this year. The company managed to secure more than $1.5 mln worth of investment in April 2016. BitKan has managed to gain more than several million clients already. All that could lead to growth in the trading volume.\nRight now, Bitcoin\u2019s price is forming within a long-term correction towards the upward trend. BTC has reached an important level. Similar situations have happened before, and they weren\u2019t rare. For example, the most recent powerful growth, which happend in late May this year, occurred in a similar situation. But there is always an alternative scenario - the continuation of a long-term downward correction.\n", "birthday": "2016-09-06T13:32:00+01:00", "date": "2016-09-06 12:32:00", "year": 2016, "month": 9, "day": 6}

The reason for that was a significant resistance in the form of accumulated volume of sell orders. When will this protracted flat end?\nResults of the summer\nThis summer started with many people deciding to buy Ether. An exit from a flat, which has been forming during the entirety of spring, should have led to a long upward movement. But the negative news has provoked many into selling Ether. After a short rally, Ethereum\u2019s price has returned to the value it had in early spring.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that with regards to Bitcoin, this growth has taken a form of a correction wave. Without fortifying at a key line, ETHBTC went downwards towards the next level. Before Ethereum fell, many decided to buy Bitcoin. Bitcoin\u2019s growth was quite powerful, but after a downward Ethereum trend, a lot of traders started selling their Bitcoins. News of the DAO hack have caused a small panic on Ethereum, which led to a lot of Ether sell orders. Could those events become a reason for Bitcoin\u2019s fall?\n\nAt the moment, Ethereum\u2019s price is yet again testing an important level, with an accumulated volume of sell orders. The situation is still ambiguous. A rebound from the resistance line indicates just that. Many are indecisive about buying Ether. That\u2019s why the growth was followed by a fall towards the starting point. A more confident growth of Ether will only be possible after the price stops near the level of 0.022 (or $13 on ETHUSD). Such a reaction will indicate a possibility for a more protracted growth. More than 88K ethers is accumulated in sell orders at that mark, which is a third more than the buy orders. That\u2019s why a fortification near 0.022 and formation of a turn could lead to a good upward impulse.\n\nUntil that scenario plays out, Ethereum\u2019s price has a chance to fall to the lower level of 0.015. A large volume of buy orders has accumulated at the 0.015 mark, which is why the long-term scenario will be decided at that level.\nETCUSD\nThe price of Ethereum Classic has managed to fortify beyond the accumulated volume near $1.3 and form an upward trend. That movement is so far within the boundaries of a correction for the entire downward trend from $3.5, because ETC\u2019s price will face a tough resistance line near $2.2.

Its two authors came up with an economic framework to analyze their exchange rates.\nBlockchain as a challenge for central banks\nThe Bank of England had earlier released a research paper that studied the macroeconomic consequences of issuing central bank digital currency (CBDC). The 2015 paper\u00a0by the Bank for International Settlements noted that the emergence of distributed ledger technology could present a hypothetical challenge to central banks by reducing their functions and, in an extreme case, may obviate their need as a central body entirely for certain functions.\nThe paper, written by Wilko Bolt of De Nederlandsche Bank, The Netherlands and Bank of Canada\u2019s Maarten R.C. van Oordt, suggests that the exchange rates of various virtual currencies may diverge widely depending on adoption, transactional demand, the quantity and growth rate of monetary units, speculative demand and network stability (survival probabilities).\nThe value of virtual currencies\nHowever, the research for the Bank of Canada seems compact in its focus. In the paper titled On the Value of Virtual Currencies, its model predicts that the exchange rate of virtual currency will become less sensitive to the impact of shocks to speculators\u2019 beliefs as it becomes more established.\nThe prediction undermines the notion that excessive exchange rate volatility will prohibit the widespread use of virtual currency particularly as speculative motives are widely believed to be an important factor for the value of virtual currencies.\nMore use cases are needed\nThe authors say virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, represent both the emergence of a new form of currency and a new payment technology to purchase goods and services.

Cointelegraph spoke with the CEO and Co-Founder of AntShares Da Hongfei about the project and its value for the market.\nWhat is AntShares?\nAntShares\u00a0is a decentralized and distributed network protocol based on Blockchain technology. Sounds like a description of any other platform developed on top of the Blockchain? Wait until you know more.\nAntShares allows digitalizing real-world assets, enabling registration, depository, transfer, trading, clearing and settlement via a peer-to-peer network. AntShares keeps records of the transfers of digital assets with e-contracts. In AntShares digital tokens generated by e-contracts function as general underlying data and could be used for recording titles and assets, including equities, creditor\u2019s claims, securities, financial contracts, credit points, bills and currencies.\nThe platform has a potential to be applied for areas like equity crowdfunding, equity trading, employee stock ownership plans, peer-to-peer financing, loyalty programs, private equity funds and supply-chain financing.\nA gap in the market\nSounds like an ambitious project, right? The idea for a project was inspired by nothing less than market demand. CEO of AntShares Da Hongfei explains:\n \u201cThe team started the project two years ago truly believing that it could make some real progress and pave the path for greater industrial adoption of this revolutionary technology. There is a strong demand not only from the community of investors, geeks and crypto-lovers, but genuinely from the market players and policy makers.\u201d \nSpeaking of the inspiration behind AntShares, he continues:\n \u201cAnts have a social structure in which they enjoy equality but shoulder different tasks. Share is both a verb and a noun. I think the name AntShares speaks for itself, that we were actually inspired by these diligent and marvellous creatures and the spirit of the Internet and the theme of our time.\u201d \nInnovation drives ahead in the competition\nWith technology developing at a really fast pace it is getting more and more challenging to stay competitive on the market and stand out among services playing around with the Blockchain.\nThere are many Blockchain projects which focus on digital assets. According to Da Hongfei, what makes Antshares stand out from that crowd is that the service is made to bridge the real world in compliance. Therefore, Da Hongfei does not really see any obvious competitors in this direction. However, compliance is not the only thing which keeps AntShares ahead of similar projects. Da Hongfei summarized at least three features which make AntShares innovative and therefore unique.\nFirst of all, the platform has built-in KYC/AML APIs, with an optional user-controlled identity check. This allows market players to use this public chain without getting cold feet, while users may choose to stay anonymous as long as all parties involved agree.\nSecondly, the platform offers a Superconducting Transaction Feature. Exchanges will no longer offer escrows, but only match-making. The \u201cescrows\u201d will be replaced by onchain-broadcasting of private-key-signed order requests. This eliminates any previous moral/tech risks associated with traditional exchanges.\nThirdly, the direct using of fiat currency is available to eliminate regulatory risks in terms of government interference.\nLast, but not the least, the platform adopts an original dBFT consensus mechanism, ideal for private/consortium chain reconstruction and also practical for the major market players.\nFor geeks out there, there is a White Paper published by AntShares where you can learn more about the system\u2019s model and algorithm.", "birthday": "2016-08-31T16:29:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-31 15:29:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 31}

As far as the vast majority of us knows, the world orbits the sun, and the sun orbits the U.S. Dollar. Every nation in the world has been forced to become a loyal subject of this Western-based hegemony for decades, and the U.S. has been living on an unlimited credit card ever since World War II.\nThis cozy world of fiat dominance, well-maintained at the barrel of a gun, has worked out incredibly well for the U.S. Government, its central bankers, and the citizens of the republic.\nWell, I\u2019m here to report to you that the days of $499 42\u201d HD TVs and $1.99 gallons of gas are numbered, and a new economic reality show is about to begin.\nOne that will be built around technological innovations like Bitcoin\u2019sblockchain technology and new dedicated instruments like Ripple. These protocols will help change the monetary systems of the world forever, systems that frankly are long overdue for an upgrade, and the \u2018American Empire\u2019 will never be the same again.\nFools and vested interests may end up blaming \u2018The Blockchain\u2019\nFirst things first. I titled this article this way for a reason. The U.S. Dollar is going to collapse, and it will collapse regardless of the implementation of these new technologies.\nIn the coming years, when the U.S. Dollar has been removed from its global leadership position, there may be a spin from vested interests to blame the newdigital currency technologies wrought by Bitcoin for this economic reset.\nThis would be as foolish as blaming CGI for the relatively poor movies we have been left with over the last two decades. This financial \u2018House of Cards\u2019 was tumbling down long beforeBitcoin and blockchain technologies came along.\nThe nations of the world both admire, hate, and fear the United States. When you have one country creating the world\u2019s best entertainment, importing and cultivating the world\u2019s best technologies, producing the world\u2019s largest military force, and commanding the world\u2019s \u201cglobal reserve currency,\u201d what you have is a true global empire, not unlike Rome was a couple of millennia ago.\nThis has led to an American military base in virtually every nation in the world, copious amounts of U.S. Dollars in every central bank in the world, and an international resentment for this level of seemingly unlimited access and control of the world.\nThe other 190+ nations of the world would love to remove this \u2018American empire,\u2019 and are burning the Midnight Oil to do just that, or are waiting to join someone who can. Just like with Rome, all empires must collapse.\nI would recommend you check out Doug Casey\u2019s \u201cThe International Man\u201d free newsletter. It goes over the similarities between the fall of the Roman Empire andthe coming fall of the American empire in painstaking detail. His wisdom should serve you well.\nThose who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it, and the American empire is proving no different.\nWho wouldn\u2019t love and trust the U.S. Dollar?\nThe U.S. Dollar currency also is following a similar failed path to self-destruction. A quick economic lesson on how Global Reserve Currency status works.\nWhen a single currency is chosen for reconciliation of international trade for all goods, be it steel, food, military equipment, or oil (creating the \u2018Petrodollar,\u2019) that is a called the global reserve currency status, which the U.S. Dollar currently enjoys.\nThese powers normally last a couple of generations, and then are reconstituted. The U.S. Dollar has managed to reign supreme over the world for well over 70 years, and like a 70 year-old person, it is running out of time, and it shows.\nWhether it is through the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cQuantitative Easing,\u201d the massive purchasing of gold by banks and governments recently, or the Federal Reserve being forced to buy their own Treasury Bonds to prop it up,because no other nation wants them anymore, every other nation is plotting, planning, and rooting for the Dollar\u2019s coming demise, whether they say so publicly or not.\nBeing the global reserve currency forces nations to hold and use the U.S. Dollar for international trade, instead of their own currencies. This also allows the U.S. print trillions of dollars each year to pay for wars, debt and other financially irresponsible behavior.\nBasically, it is a license to print money and abuse the global system, while exporting the inflation (amount of currency in circulation) to the rest of the world.\n\nIn exchange for these exported dollars, the U.S. gets the world\u2019s finest goods and resources back, in exchange.\nAs long as this system continues, the US government can continue to go deeper into debt without suffering serious consequences, and they have been abusing this system for decades.\nJust imagine being totally broke (If you wereover $19 trillion in debt, you\u2019d be considered broke, too), yet every time you want to borrow money there\u2019s a crowd of delighted lenders eager to replenish your wallet with fresh funds.\nIn addition, not only has the U.S. been piling on the debt and currency creation, but they have been muscling the world\u2019s banking system to do their bidding, at will. Creating FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) is a great example.\nTheFATCA regulations are designed to tax Americans who work abroad (the U.S. is the only country on Earth who does this) and they force the rest of the world to do the actual legal legwork.\nAll the documentation and vetting is done by the foreign banks, and any current, or former, U.S. citizen, or business, is attacked with paperwork, background checks, and scrutiny that is a chore for the banks to comply with, much less the entity themselves.\nThis has led to banks in other countries to turn away Americans due to the amount of work and oversight involved. Everything the American does must be reported back to the U.S. authorities and if not, the bank is excommunicated from the global banking system.\nSo the shorthand of it is a current, or former, American citizen shouldn\u2019t expect to get a foreign bank account any time soon, and even if you do, you probably won\u2019t want it.\nThis is basically a backdoor \u2018capital control,\u2019 keeping American funds in America, by regulating the citizen and the foreign country/bank.\nIn other words, the U.S. Government has gotten so good at creating new laws and regulations they are now creating them for the rest of the world to follow as well. How sweet is that?\nIn addition, foreign banks who don\u2019t play ball are subject to massive fines by the United States if they don\u2019t \u2018play ball.\u2019 Two years ago, French bank BNP Paribas had topay $9,000,000,000 in U.S. fines by helping clients dodge U.S. sanctions on Iran, Sudan and other countries.\nIf you want to turn France from a friend to an enemy, that\u2019s a good place to start, by trying to bankrupt their major banks. There are countless examples of the U.S. bullying the globe with their laws, and using the global financial system they control as leverage.\nWell, the nations of the world have had just about enough, and sure would like to find a better was in the 21st century. Foreign banks and governments aren\u2019t interested in being American lap dogs for international taxation. They don\u2019t like reporting everything to the U.S. because the U.S. says so. They don\u2019t like military bases in their country, and they really aren\u2019t interested in propping up the U.S. Dollar, which is being printed into oblivion, which doesn\u2019t really cause Americans inflation as much as it causes the rest of the world inflation, which is America\u2019s greatest export. Well, that and warfare.\nInternational trades are supposed to be done via the U.S. Dollar, which artificially increases its use and demand for the USD worldwide, while keeping inflation in check, for Americans, as over half the dollars in circulation are used outside of the country for these trades.\nWhat if you didn\u2019t need USD to transmit value, and you could create a global digital system to do the same function, only much faster and cheaper, without the American middleman collecting a fee every time?\nWell, now we get to where digital avenues like the blockchain and Ripple come in. The world is now ready for a better, 21st-century way of doing business. Using the USD for international trade is like using a newspaper to get the latest news. You\u2019re really reading yesterday\u2019s news today and international trades are really using yesterday\u2019s technology to perform this function.\nBanks, and now nations, are hoping onblockchain technology to do things faster, cheaper and more efficiently, and these newer systems will have nothing to do with the \u2018ole C-note.\nChina: We have a better idea\nChina, in association with their BFF, Russia, have been working together to build economic systems that will give the world alternatives to the American Empire\u2019s systems like the U.S.-controlled World Bank, the IMF, and the SWIFT system.\n\nChina has created the BRICS Development Bank, The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and theCross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) to buttress their future endeavors without need for the U.S. Dollar or the U.S. Government\u2019s power plays.\nThey have asked the nations of the world if they want in, and have found a very receptive audience. The fact that China is amongst the world\u2019s largest exporters, gold producers, rare earth minerals miners, and the second-largest economic power may have something to do with that.\nBreaking up the well-established Western hegemony is the other side of that coin, so even American BFF\u2019s like Great Britain, havechose to join China\u2019s international economic initiatives, as a \u201cFounding Member,\u201d no less.\nWill China become a global tyrannical economic mastodon like the U.S. in the future, once they have everyone onboard their \u2018Silk Road\u2019 to economic prosperity? Probably, but they are playing the part of the good host, for now, and that seems better than the alternative.\nPlus, they don\u2019t really need to create a villain to build a following with. The U.S. is doing a fine job of that, all by themselves. If China becomes a problem down the road, kich that can down the road. There is a problem here and now that needs to be dealt with from The West.\nChina has discussed the construction ofa digital currency of their own, i would necesitate blockchain technology, with Citibank and Deloitte. This most probably will be to facilitate an international economic trading system, if not a revised Chinese national monetary system, in the future.\nWith the amount of capital flight from China over the last two years, don\u2019t discount the Chinese going fully-digital to close off these financial outflows in the future. However, initially, this is about getting off the USD system, bringing their global trading partners closer, and moving the U.S. off the global stage.\nThere are also new financial options, likeRipple. What was once the hot new altcoin that seemingly faded into irrelevance seems to be getting a second chance at stardom. Ripple\u2019s mission was to optimize larger financial transfers, like those done between banks, not people. Well,Ripple has reached an agreement with a Japanese consortium of 15 banks, and 30 by next year, to use their protocol for payments and settlements.\nThis would allow payments that may take days to happen in real-time, and potentially provide a pathway off the U.S.-managed SWIFT system, saving the banks 90% in fees. Consider this a beta test that, if successful, will attract the rest of the world\u2019s banks like moths to a flame.\nDon\u2019t forget the domestic collectivist movement\nNational indebtedness in the U.S. has passed $18 trillion, by far the most of any country in the history of the world. The rest of the planet has had it with the egregious economic policies of the American government and are building options that will remove the U.S. from power in the not-too-distant-future. Blockchan technology and Ripple are just another nail in the coffin of the U.S. Dollar.\nThere is a clearly a better way of doing international business.Bitcoin owners may have known this since 2009, but now the rest of the world is catching on.\nThe U.S. Dollar, and the government itself, are making their system obsolete through regulation, hubris, and silly Keynsian central planning. When, not if, the U.S. Dollar collpases from all of these internal, and extrenal, economic pressures, some countries will be more than ready for what comes next.\nKeynesian economists have proven to be wrong about everything. You can\u2019t print your way out of debt.Fiat money is debt, and every single fiat currency in the history of man has collapsed. The U.S. Dollar will be no different.\nCentral banksters, around the world, not just in the U.S., are gaming the system so that they win and you lose. Their minions are targeting cash and the $100 bill, and are trying to push the false narrative that cash is the key to terrorism.\n    \nHey, why not ban cash altogether? Why not force every transaction through the banking system, so the banks can track everything, skim off the top, and apply endless fees to everything from your direct deposit to your debit card transactions?\nIf it were up to the banks and government, you would be dependent upon them for everything, and totally economically captured in the process, so you couldn\u2019t be free to escape their clutches. Cash would never be an option because you have too much freedom and privacy when using cash, so they plan to ban cash, and aredoing so as we speak.\nFormer IMF minion Kenneth Rogoff is the latest pushing this collectivist agenda and propaganda into the mainstream via theWall Street Journal, openly criminalizing the use of cash.\nNow, you shouldn\u2019t have cash because a terrorist might use it. Next, you shouldn\u2019t have Bitcoin, or you shouldn\u2019t wear shoes or smartphones (Hey, terrorist use them too, right?)

What is so important about that mark? According to data from the POLONIEX exchange, that is the mark with the highest accumulated volume of sell orders. The level of $13 also matches the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement. Is it a coincidence? About 50K Ether is in sell orders set at that mark. If that\u2019s most of the traders, their future expectations are not exactly positive. A bit lower, near $11.5, there is about 35K Ether worth of sell deals. The volume of buy orders is about twice as low. A larger level, which also matches the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement has been formed at $10. That level of buy orders will slow down the fall of Ethereum\u2019s price, at least for as long as it exists. At first, one might think that the overall situation favors a decline, but it\u2019s still too early to draw final conclusions. The market is always changing, so it\u2019s more reasonable to use a conservative approach.\n\nThe level of $10 can be a support line for the formation of an upward trend. But for a more confident turn, the price has to pass the $13 mark, as that line can become a support line for a powerful fall. That\u2019s why waiting for the price to fortify at one level or another is a more conservative approach. Such a reaction will indicate some degree of certainty.\nETC/USD\nEthereum Classic keeps falling. It seems that the earlier sharp growth was of a purely speculative nature. ETC is headed towards its original value.

Cointelegraph looks into why cryptocurrency payment systems are still underdeveloped.\nBitcoin as part of online gaming ecosystem\nThe talks started in 2011. Back then, entrepreneur Calvin Ayre\u00a0published a list of his own predictions for online gaming industry in 2012. One of them was about Bitcoin.\nIt said:\n \u201cSomeone is going to figure out how to make this work and when they do, all the anti-gambling, over-regulating authoritarian governments will be exposed as emperors without clothes.\u201d \nToday, cryptocurrency payments make an integral part of gaming ecosystem. According to some estimates, 40% of Bitcoin turnover is related to online gaming. There are more than 150 Bitcoin and altcoin casinos worldwide, not to mention several hundreds of websites accepting cryptocurrencies as an alternative payment method.\nThe majority of these sites use Bitcoin as a gaming chip or the betting currency. The spectrum of games is extremely wide: from the digital versions of Poker and Blackjack to Bitcoin-based bookmaking.\nAnother category of platforms allows players to compete against each other for coins. These competitions are usually based on well-known video games or simple PvP skill-based games, developed specifically for this purpose.\nFinally, there is also a number of games where player can receive a reward for the gaming process itself.\nBitcoin as ideal casino chip\nSeveral years ago, speaking of Bitcoin advantages, experts called the currency an ideal casino chip - \u201cimmediate, private and irreversible\u201d - and claimed it combined the best attributes of an optimal e-Gaming payment method.\nHowever, the time doesn\u2019t stand still; both markets are developing rapidly. Eventually, such dynamics have brought to surface some shortcomings of existing systems, and it became clear that even the so-called \u201cmatch made in crypto\u201d has its own weak spots.\nChris Wollner, Project Analyst at BitRush Corp., Director at Start-it Ltd, says:\n \u201cThe bitcoin blockchain is too slow for instant payments, so players have to deposit funds with the provider, thus they have to trust the provider and the provider is under pressure from the responsibility: even an honest provider can cause their clients to lose funds with malfunctioning, for example. The alternative is loading up using expensive middlemen, such as credit cards, paypal, or bank-type institutions, who may take the responsibility of instant payments on themselves, but for a very high cost.\u201d \nPayments in real time without delays\nA Toronto-based company BitRush raised this issue again in one of its blog posts earlier this year. At that time, the company also dropped a subtle hint that the solution was already found.\nThe solution became known as ANOON - a multi-currency payment platform integrated with Bitcoin blockchain. Built on the company\u2019s own cryptographic technology, ANOON can\u2019t be called a blockchain system - and yet, it uses the Distributed Ledger Architecture (DLA) and decentralized consensus algorithm.\u00a0", "birthday": "2016-08-29T17:35:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-29 16:35:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 29}

It\u2019s the bandwagon effect, blind optimism and emotional judgement that made us turn a blind eye to the fatal flaws of the organization.\nOur collective irrational investing behaviour manifests in a few ways, which we identify further on.\nBandwagon effect trumps rational evaluation\nBeing a DAO token holder presents a can\u2019t-miss-opportunity to potentially change history, because the fund is built on the wisdom of the crowd, which gives every vote the same weight in decision making.\nNeedless to say participating in such a scheme brings a feeling of significance to the individuals involved: it promises a nearly heroic act where everyone invested in it has a stake in shaping a futuristic movement that could change the world.\nDavid Strayhorn, a self-proclaimed cyberpunk and Bitcoin enthusiast, compared investing in The DAO to the excitement of the rocket-building experiment in the movie \u201cOctober Sky\u201d, where a bunch of high school kids tried to change history by taking up rocketry.\nThe community that supported The DAO - most of them cyberpunks, technocrats and idealists like Strayhorn - band together very closely on the values they hold near and dear to their heart. Such a close-knit community can breed acts of conformity without them being aware of it, such as making a highly risky investment decision without properly and rationally investigating the possible outcome.\nJim Yuan, another early investor in The DAO also admitted that in retrospect, \u201cfear of missing out\u201d compelled him to participate.\nYuan says that It was worth it to be among the first X number of people who got into The DAO. The FOMO factor was reinforced by The DAO crowdsale, which gradually increased the unit price per every 100 DAO tokens after the first 15 days, making a case to buy in during the first 2 weeks for a better return on investment.\n\nImage provided by Elaine's idle mind.\nStephen DeMeulenaere, another early investor who lost his faith in the platform after the hack, said he \u201cfelt pressured to invest in The DAO\u201d when the crowdsale launched, even though he couldn\u2019t get his Blockchain to properly sync up.\nThe momentum created by the crowdsale urged early investors to act fast and act early (see the price graph during the campaign period above). As one can see, the fastest growth of the crowdsale happened during the first 15 days before the price increased.\n\nImage provided by\u00a0DAO Stats.\nConfirmation bias led to unexamined confidence\nVitalik Buterin\u2019s voice represents a community of technocratic early adopters who are deeply entrenched in their own beliefs that a machine-enforced process is superior and foolproof. When participants of the movement strongly identify with a charismatic leader such as Vitalik, they tend to overlook contrary voices of criticism and selectively search for evidence that confirms their pre-determined belief instead. \u00a0\nVitalik\u2019s influence on the crypto community is comparable to that of a spiritual cult leader, as described in the article on Backchannel magazine. The writer described Vitalik as a public persona \u201cto be admired and adored\u201d and that with Ethereum Vitalik \u201cis building a platform that has inspired people he hasn\u2019t even met to completely rearrange their lives and professional priorities.\u201d\nWith the influence he had already gained from Ethereum, Vitalik\u2019s role as a curator of The DAO gave the project undue credibility. Like many believers in Ethereum\u2019s potential, Strayhorn says he believes \u201cVitalik is the real deal\u201d which gave him an instant credibility and trust in The DAO without further investigation.\nIn a well-constructed argument advocating for the virtues of DAOs, Vitalik made the case that DAOs\u2019 ability to supercede whatever incentives are driving the individuals behind the organization and act according to nothing but its \u201csource code\u201d makes it \u201cnot even possible for the organization\u2019s \u2018mind\u2019 to cheat\u201d.", "birthday": "2016-08-30T12:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-30 11:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 30}

Yet, without making changes and testing, things will never improve.\nBitcoin Core is also going to be upgraded and hopefully things will be better for the cryptocurrency after it comes out. The new version is 0.13.0, and this release brings several new features, but the chief among them is Segregated Witness (Segwit) which is likely to solve some crucial issues which has plagued Bitcoin such as scalability and malleability.\nDoing more with less\nSegwit is a proposed solution to the slowness of Bitcoin transactions and has been included in the release 0.13.0. Segwit may be a workaround to allow more transactions through without increasing the blocksize, which has been part of a raging debate for a while.\nAlthough Segwit is not supported on the mainnet, testnet use is supported in this release. This \u2018new\u2019 solution has been around since December 2015 and the inclusion in testnet will allow it to be extensively tested before it is fully rolled out.\nCharles Hoskinson, CEO of Input Output Hong Kong, tells Cointelegraph:\n \u201cSegregated Witness has been one of the most peer reviewed and tested concepts in the space. It's a positive step forward in terms of evolving the Bitcoin script, resolves the malleability issue and has positive scalability implications.\u201d \n\nBraveNewCoin recently reported:\n \u201cDeploying the SegWit code won't be instant, but there is a pretty strong consensus behind doing so already.

A hacker can thus change this ID and it would appear as if the transaction did not take place. One of the advantages of SegWit is that it would help alleviate this issue in Bitcoin.\nBitcoincore.org revealed on their website:\n \u201cSegWit prevents third-party and scriptSig malleability by allowing Bitcoin users to move the malleable parts of the transaction into the transaction witness, and segregating that witness so that changes to the witness does not affect calculation of the txid.\u201d \nLow Fee transactions might go through\n\u201cChild pays for parent\u201d has also been implemented in this release. No, we are not suddenly talking about filial piety but rather the replacement of a mining algorithm with another which now will allow low fee transactions to also be processed if a high fee transaction spends its outputs.\nIn the past one of the problems that plagued Bitcoin was that low fee transactions were often delayed and sometimes not carried out.", "birthday": "2016-08-30T13:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-30 12:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 30}

Preferably the wallet seed or private keys were generated on that \"cold wallet\" (or \"cold storage\") machine. Furthermore, the machine never had and never will have an internet connection. The public seed or receiving Bitcoin addresses are exported from that machine and loaded onto the web application service.\nCT: Is cold storage at all practical for transactions?\nRG: Absolutely. Genitrust developed a proven solution, most popularly used by Wall of Coins. Wall of Coins has proven the ability to release coins - after the end user's request - just as quickly as any multisig hot wallet.\nCT: How can you move coins quickly in and out of cold storage? Doesn't that require an internet connection?\nRG: That's true. The only part that requires an internet connection is the act of \"broadcasting\" the Bitcoin transaction to other Bitcoin nodes. The remaining operations can be performed on an offline computer.\nCT: Does this provide greater security? How about speed?\nRG: Greater security is no question. The speed is equal to that of - or faster- than online multisig operations which are still vulnerable and accessible to the endless world of security attacks. When you have this vulnerability, your hot wallets grow more vulnerable as the stored crypto value increases.\nCT: I'd assume this fast cold storage is good for online exchanges that handle thousands of customers' funds. How many use this?\nRG: Correct. The biggest limitation of transactions is the same limitation of Bitcoin's Blockchain.

With alleged connections in everything from the Bank of England to M16, to The Bilderberg Group, suffice it to say it is common knowledge that the rumored trillionaire family could buy and sell billionaire Donald J. Trump and not even notice the transaction.\nSo when a Rothschild says they have reduced their position in the U.S. Dollar, it is a big deal worth noting, or even taking advantage of. \u2018Follow the money,\u2019 right?\nJeff Berwick of The Dollar Vigilante surmises that the Rothschilds are looking to get ahead of the downward trend curve, and cash out before a global collapse, and use gold to pick up the pieces. I know it\u2019s hard to imagine a bunch of banking interests colluding and timing a market exit, only to capitalize on the aftermath, but here are Berwick\u2019s thoughts in the video below:\n    \nGeorge Soros, another Trump-trampling magnate, who\u2019s Soros Fund Management LLC is loaded with an estimated $30 billion in investment capital,\u00a0is also moving in on gold. In his emailed opinion sent to the Wall Street Journal, the \u201ccontinued weakness in China will exert deflationary pressure, a damaging spiral of falling wages and prices, on the US and global economies.\u201d\nDeflation, or the restriction of the money supply, can have devastating short-term effects in the fiat currency-based economy. Deflation is the solid foundation that Bitcoin is built upon due to the fact that Bitcoin is not debt-based but value-based through the solid economic principles of supply and demand.\nThis is truly how \u2018sound money\u2019 is created, yet this is not how national and global economics are handled anymore since the age of central banking has lead us to this point.\nWhat point is this? The point where the world\u2019s central banking system has tried to print their fiat currency into oblivion to get ahead of their debt crisis, and it has failed. The point where negative interest rates, which many said would never happen just 2-3 years ago, are now becoming the norm.\nThe point where China is hedging the bets and is looking to establish their own digital currency, while also buying and mining every piece of gold in existence. They are rumored to have as many as 10000 tons of gold. Their BFF and\u00a0fellow BRICS bank member, Russia, is also bullish on gold, having tripled their holdings since 2005.\nAmerican bank runs and end of USD Global Reserve Status?\nWhat could be the fallout of a shift to negative interest rates? Jim Willie of GoldenJackass.com states that\u00a0a run on the banks could be one scenario. Since the \u201cbail-in\u201d concept debuted in the Cyprus collapse of 2013, and it may cost depositors money to store their fiat currency in banks going forward, why wouldn\u2019t savers \u2018cash-out?\u2019\nThe\u00a0real rate of inflation is closer to 5% than the stated 1-2%, so you\u2019re losing money, anyway. Why lose 25 basis points to 1%, risk a bank \u201cbail-in,\u201d lose money to inflation and the opportunity costs that could await them in gold, silver, or Bitcoin? At what point will bank investors get the picture and say \u2018Enough?\u2019\nThis movement by the Rothschilds, Soros, and others is a clear sign of greater value in gold over the U.S. Dollar. Willie also speculates that the Chinese banking interests are negotiating with the BIS, the Bank for International Settlements, the central bank of central banks, on a revaluation of gold into a $5000 per ounce neighborhood.\nAccording to Willie, a treaty between them could switch international contracts from a U.S. Dollar exchange to gold, which would have major ramifications on USD and gold values, further eroding the global reserve status of the U.S. Dollar, if not ending it altogether.\nGold values are already up over 25% in 2016,\u00a0the first year it has shown YTY growth since 2010. Bitcoin is up over 33%, after rising over 36% in 2015, when it was the best-performing currency on the planet. is Bitcoin one of the \u2018other currencies\u2019 the Rothschild family is investing in? Most probably not, but they seem like the types that like to bet on a winning horse, and Bitcoin is out-performing gold versus the U.S. Dollar.\nNow if the Rothschilds and the Soros fund know that gold will begin to replace the USD in global trade in the very near future, and they might, that would explain the move, but what \u2018other currencies\u2019 was Lord Jacob referring too? I didn\u2019t know gold, or possibly silver, is a currency? Who uses them as currency? Bitcoin is at least a currency, and I would argue it is better money than the U.S. Dollar, which the Federal Reserve will tell you themselves is currency, not money. \u00a0\nBitcoin is still on the table as an investment play until I see otherwise. Who doesn\u2019t like 30+% returns? Much more, if the USD gets devalued?\nWhere does this leave us?\nIMHO, something is clearly afoot in the global economic markets, and the Rothschilds would know it, and move on it, well before the markets at large. You know what they say, \u201cFollow the money.\u201d If, or when, the U.S. Dollar moves to its true inherent value, which is zero, as noted financial expert Robert Kiyosaki has stated before, will you be able to buy food with a gold bar? Will you be able to get a gold bar to begin with? \u00a0\nIt is estimated that, in the U.S., less than half of a percent of American\u2019s investment accounts have exposure to precious metals, and even less to Bitcoin. Everybody is on the same ship, counting their dollars, and watching the rigged stock markets. When that boat sinks, and it will, what will be in your (digital) wallet?\nPersonally, I\u2019m expecting the unexpected this October. Between the massive ramp up of military drills and weapons testing, the ascension of Donald Trump in the Presidential election polls, the end of the economic fiscal year and Super Jubilee Year, which ties in with\u00a0last year\u2019s Shemitah, only five weeks away, and the announced movement by kings makers like George Soros and Jacob Rothschild, something big is coming, and we are being kept in the day about what it is. Too many stars are in alignment to ignore.\nNow, this all may be nothing, or it could be a bunch of financial tea leaves that may lead to prosperity, or a doomsday scenario. I\u2019m hoping nothing much comes of this, but I fear the worst. This may help someone in the weeks and months to come. At least you have some alternative information from those darned \u201cconspiracy theorists.\u201d", "birthday": "2016-08-22T17:55:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-22 16:55:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 22}

His bank, HSBC, has shown that Blockchain has the potential to take away paper which could be completely revolutionary if commercialized.\nHe said in a Yahoo\u00a0interview:\n \u201cWhen you\u2019re trading internationally, there is a fundamental disconnect between the buyer and the seller where the buyer would like to pay as late as possible once he\u2019s got certainty that the goods are being shipped and the seller wants to get paid as early as possible. And that\u2019s impossible without an intermediary made to get trust issues. What this technology does is to provide a transparent mechanism to share information in a paperless world. So the proof of concept is absolutely fundamental to making this transition possible.\u201d \nRamachandran thinks the upside of the technology \u00a0is going to be more trade:\n \u201cThe upside is going to be for companies buying and selling internationally. It\u2019s going to be cheaper and quicker. The role of the bank to mitigate trust issues and to provide financing doesn\u2019t go away. So this makes the system much more efficient. So it\u2019s expensive to adopt it but the upside is huge.\u201d \nLetter of credit as global standard\nHe also says that the global standard will be a letter of credit which exists today and what his bank has been trying to do is to replicate that standard on a distributed ledger.\n \u201cThe solution is going to be collaboration,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be banks, shipping companies and corporates adopting it together. But having the same standard of a letter of credit which has now been around for over a 100 years \u00a0is going to be free. Collaboration would be key.\u201d \nRamachandran said the Blockchain has felt like a solution looking for a problem. He suggests that looking into trade finance where issues of trust between buyers and sellers exist; or the gap between when payment is made and goods are sent, are the best use cases which are ideal for Blockchain.", "birthday": "2016-08-22T13:20:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-22 12:20:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 22}

Their active support could provoke the bears into giving up on their positions and thus leading to Ethereum\u2019s growth.\nHow long will this sideway movement continue?\nEthereum\u2019s price is forming a flat between two important resistance lines. The bulls\u2019 support is clear at $10. The volume has accumulated at exactly that level, from which Ethereum\u2019s price has been rebounding and moving up. The same can be said about the $14 mark. A similar situation is present at that level, albeit it favors the bears. They are not allowing Ethereum to grow by selling near the $14 mark and counting on the downward trend to continue.

The previous break through the level of 10 was a false one, because the price has returned into the flat.

It can save banking fees, protect against identity theft, maintain financial independence, and remove the fear of having one\u2019s funds shut down in the case of controversial activity. However, losing the banking system is not without its drawbacks.\nCointelegraph interviewed Tiffany Hayden, founder and CEO of Enable Payments and a candidate for the US Congress, about the potential downsides of going completely unbanked.\nCointelegraph: How useful or necessary is it to have a bank account?\nTiffany Hayden: Using cash for everyday transactions is a hassle. It\u2019s aggravating how often a cashier hands back the incorrect change. It doesn\u2019t happen occasionally, it happens all the time. I doubt there are any cash registers out there that don\u2019t tell the cashier exactly how much change to hand back, so that means it\u2019s either a counting problem or it\u2019s being done intentionally. I don\u2019t have time to give a math lesson every time I go through a drive-thru, so I usually end up ignoring it.\nSpeaking of time, paying with cash at the gas station is an entire event. I cannot believe the number of people who go inside to pay. There is always a line. The cigarette and lottery people are the worst. They\u2019re usually on a first name basis with the cashier and make lots of small talk.\nMaking a car payment without having a bank account is a pain. My car is financed through Chase Bank. If I send somebody $300 in Bitcoin, they can\u2019t go into Chase Bank with $300 and my account number to make the payment for me. Chase Bank does not accept cash from non-customers! They will point to a grocery store across the street and tell you to purchase a money-order first and then come back to make the payment.\nPrepaid credit cards might sound like a good idea, but my first experience was a small nightmare. I was given a $500 Kroger prepaid Visa card. The card says that it is FDIC insured\u2026after it\u2019s activated. The problem was that I couldn\u2019t activate it. The only way to activate the card was to call an automated number. Every time I entered the numbers on the card, I got an error message saying the numbers weren\u2019t valid. I tried over and over with no luck. There was no option at all to speak to customer service. It was just one big loop of rejection. It took me awhile to get a human on the phone and when I did, the customer service representative pretty much told me I was out of luck. She said there was absolutely nothing she could do, that the automated number was the only way in the world to activate the card, and to try and again from another phone. Click. She hung up on me.\nI started complaining on social media. The person who purchased the card tried to activate it and had the same experience. It took several hours and a small army to activate the card. There was no \u201cah-ha\u201d moment. There wasn\u2019t a specific problem that was suddenly resolved. From what I can tell, there was a deliberate decision made to activate the card only because I didn\u2019t go away quietly.\nAn online friend suggested that the reason why I was unable to activate the card and the reason why I told to try calling from another phone is because I use a prepaid SIM. This person alluded to the idea of a national database of SIM card registries and that prepaid cards over a certain threshold may only be allowed to be activated from a registered SIM.\nIt was an interesting idea that didn\u2019t sound too far-fetched. It\u2019s my understanding that in order for a prepaid card to offer \u201cpass through\u201d FDIC insurance, the actual owner of the card must be documented. Hypothetically, it sounds possible for a third-party service to use SIM cards to offer something like \u201cidentity as a service.\u201d SIM does stand for \u201csubscriber IDENTITY module\u201d.\nBut I ended up finding the cardholder agreement online and they aren\u2019t using a third-party to validate identity. What they are doing is using a bunch of shady marketing strategies. The card purchased and the money loaded aren\u2019t actually insured by the FDIC. The cardholder agreement states:\n \u201cThe funds you have loaded on your Temporary Card are not insured for your benefit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) or any state or federal agency; however, the funds loaded onto your Personalized Card are insured for your benefit by the FDIC up to the maximum allowed by law.\u201d \nEssentially, unless the temporary card is converted into a \u201cpersonalized card\u201d -which requires identification, it\u2019s not FDIC insured.\nCT: It should be pretty easy to get a bank account, right?

He says that Apple is as popular in Europe as it is in the U.S., and The European Union considers the distribution of any personal data to any third-party as illegal, unless there is a court order. If Apple gives access to the FBI for unlimited and deliberate access to people\u2019s personal data, which also includes European citizens, then Apple will fall under major legal threats in the EU.\nRand says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cI would see no other option for Apple but to reject the FBI\u2019s request.\u201d \nThe inherent risk involved\nRand continues by pointing out the risks involved in allowing third-party access, as requested by the FBI.\nHe says:", "birthday": "2016-08-24T14:10:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-24 13:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 24}

", "content": "Every country needs US dollars if it wants to buy crude oil. This may soon change as a market selling crude oil for Bitcoin has emerged.\nThe term \u2018petrodollar\u2019 has been thrown around since the 1970s. Dollars for oil have been the principal source of earning for many oil producing nations in the Middle East, as well as in other parts of the world.\nHowever lately the petrodollar has been under a considerable amount of strain. Many have predicted its imminent demise based on a multitude of reasons such as Iran wanting to be paid in Euros for its oil sales, and the Russian President Vladimir Putin trying to get his country to move away from pricing its oil in the US currency.\nYet among all of these developments perhaps the biggest alarm bell that has been ringing for the petrodollar has been the strained relationship between Saudi Arabia which is the fiefdom of the house of Saud and the United States.\nA sweetheart deal gone sour\nIt has been the case for decades that the US and Saudi have had an understanding which involves the US protecting the House of Saud and, in return, the Saudis only pricing their oil in the US dollar.\nMoreover, the Saudi Arabian currency the Riyal and several other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) currencies are pegged to the US dollar. This pricing of oil in dollars has made the US currency the world\u2019s reserve currency of choice. However, things are not well between the US and Saudi Arabia of late with the Wall St. Daily reporting:\n \u201cThe tension between the two countries further increased recently thanks to the passing of a bill by the Senate \u2013 the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) \u2013 which would allow the families of the victims of 9/11 to sue Saudi Arabia, pending the verdict as to whether any of the country\u2019s officials were involved in the 2001 terrorist attacks.\u201d \nThe same publication also reported that the Saudi\u2019s are miffed about the US doing nothing to shore up the regime of the former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who was an ally of the Saudi Kingdom.\nThe slump in oil prices have also hit Saudi Arabia hard. The Guardian has this to say about the Saudi economic woes:\n \u201cThe Kingdom, Opec\u2019s biggest oil exporter, is said to need $100-a-barrel oil to cover its enormous public spending commitments. The International Monetary Fund warned recently that Riyadh would burn through all its financial reserves within five years under a $50 oil price unless it took steps to raise taxes or cut spending, which it has since started to do.\u201d \nThe emergence of the PetroBTC?\nIf through political machinations or economic necessity the US loses its coveted reserve currency tag, then what will replace the US dollar is an open question. One idea worth exploring would be a cryptocurrency like BTC.\nCointelegraph had a chance to talk with Shannon Lowery, Sr. Founder of NJUF Investments whose SecureTradePlatform.com is being tagged as \u2018Bitcoin\u2019s First Crude Oil Market.\u2019\nShannon is of the view that the US dollar is about to take a major hit in value and this will affect almost every major commodity and \u201cshake major exporters.\u201d In terms of commodity trading oil is of special significance because every country needs currently needs dollars to buy fuel. Shannon thinks that his crude oil market has the answers.\nHe says:\n \u201cThe crude oil market is for commercial interests to prevent speculation on oil prices. All actual buyers and sellers who take delivery of crude can buy crude oil and other energy products using BTC, because the USD is about to collapse in value.\u201d \nBTC based oil trading may be more profitable", "birthday": "2016-08-24T16:25:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-24 15:25:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 24}

Until July 31st, more than 200 people have linked their debit cards to Uber. And we keep receiving queries about that functionality. Many people asking if the card really works with Uber. We are constantly trying to add new payment methods, so we don\u2019t limit our platform to bitcoin users only.\u201d \nBari explained that one distinct advantage of Bitcoin debit cards, especially during rapidly changing circumstances, is the ability to use a virtual, online-only debit card.\nHe says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cBesides the plastic card we also have virtual cards and that is a very attractive product because you don\u2019t need to wait 2, 3 weeks until you get your card.

On a market which is undergoing rapid change and growth, recently disturbed by The DAO attack, Tao makes a bet on stable, sustained growth and long-term value.\nThe state of smart contracts market\nThe market of Blockchain-powered smart contracts is a nascent one, only becoming a thing a little over a year ago with the release of Ethereum, the first such platform to achieve wide recognition. The promise of decentralizing any imaginable application by running it on a Blockchain has let Ethereum reach unprecedented heights, making it second only to Bitcoin, as far as cryptocurrencies go.\nRecognizing the opportunity, many competitors have also appeared on the scene, such as Lisk or Ardor, each having their own comparative advantages and downsides. The common idea behind each platform is a powerful one - eliminating middlemen from all sorts of human-built systems, and at the same time increasing their efficiency and robustness. However, that idea remains unfulfilled as of yet. The platforms themselves are not worth nearly as much as the projects which can be potentially built on them, and we have yet to see one successful example of such.\nThere are some initiatives being built on Ethereum with very intriguing ideas behind them, such as Slock.it or Augur, but they are all in early to late stages of development. Ethereum itself was violently shaken by the recent DAO debacle and the following hardfork, which the community\u2019s opinions are still split over.\nTypical mistakes of existing platforms\nTaoism, an ancient philosophical tradition originating from China, teaches that good and bad are inseparable: they compliment each other, allowing the universe to flow in order. According to their whitepaper, the creators of the Tao platform seemingly took that idea to heart: they put emphasis on smooth long-term growth.\nTao developers have been paying close attention to the mistakes of the existing platforms, which allows them to avoid the same fate for their project. One protective measure they have in place is a proprietary technology called IntelliTx (Intelligent transactions). IntelliTx is expected to make Tao immune to the \u201crecursive contract call\u201d, a type of attack The DAO has succumbed to.\nAnother crucial feature is AlphaSend, which will protect the user\u2019s transactions from state-of-the-art Blockchain forensic analysis methods, which could otherwise prevent them from sending transactions in a private manner.\nFrom a purely technical standpoint, the developers promise that their Blockchain will allow for instant transactions and adaptive block sizes.

Comparing Decentralized Social Networks ", "content": "A new bitcointalk thread is currently raising issues which basically make comparisons between Steemit and Synereo.\nThough virtually every project in the industry has had some random allegations against them, the thread which was started on Friday August 19 was supposedly prompted by the recent announcement\u00a0by Synereo that its Alpha version will be going online next month.\nSteem is the digital currency behind the Steemit social media platform which rewards content \u00a0posters and voters online. Steemit was recently hacked with some accounts compromised. Steem overtook The DAO to be the world\u2019s fifth most valuable cryptocurrency following its 1000% plus growth in the days following Steemit\u2019s first cryptocurrency payout on July 4. \u00a0\nSynereo, on the other hand, proposes a semi-autonomous system which requires human involvement in the roles defined in smart contracts. Synereo offers a social model - one that integrates measures of compassion in its code, no censorship and provides users the opportunity to monetize their content and own their organic local network.\nAre they Ponzi scams? \u00a0\nWith the title, Synereo same Ponzi scam like Steem?, the OP dranster started the discussion line with an assumption that \u201cSYNEREO AMP might be the same pyramid scheme like Steem because they \u201cBoth have similar monetization techniques...AMP has a large premine like 90%\u201d and sought the view of forum members. \u00a0\nThe first responder who claims to have been following Synereo\u00a0and its developers since its ICO, and how they helped Ethereum with its new proof-of-stake protocol, dispelled the assumption as doubtful. Dsattler wrote: \u201cThe core devs are deeply involved in the crypto scene and it's highly unlikely that they put their reputation at risk with a Ponzi.\u201d\nDecentralizeEconomics cited the fully decentralized form of Synereo as the main difference with Steemit\u00a0as a centralized platform and hinted at a possible self-orchestrated collapse of Steem.\nSeveral scam accusations have been run all over the place, but it is always better to wait and let the technology being used by every startup or platform speak for itself.\nMatej Michalko, Founder and Director at DECENT (Decentralizing Content Distribution), waved the scam accusations aside saying they are not new.\nHe tells Cointelegraph:\n \u201cBeing an insider in the domain of Blockchain digital content distribution for some time, I have seen many groundless accusations merely based on dubious evidence. Most of them have been posted by people unwilling to disclose their real names for various reasons. I believe that Blockchain technologies have great potential to liberate the world of unnecessary middlemen, reduce transaction costs and do a great service to humanity. Blockchain Tech is a high technology that is still at a very early stage and has not yet crossed the chasm to mainstream markets. Projects in this space should join forces and co-operate to render Blockchain mainstream.\u201d \nSteemit is more like blockchain.info\nHowever, in an email to Cointelegraph, Ned Scott, Steemit CEO, says that Steem is a decentralized Blockchain which is leveraging segregated and isolated witness node operations from around the world through Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) consensus. He explains that the centrally held Delaware corporation, Steemit, is not a Blockchain; instead, it is a Blockchain-based web application, much like Blockchain.info, with more than sixty web applications leveraging the Steem Blockchain to date.\nAnother forum member prompted DecentralizeEconomics to support the claim that Steem will collapse because it is centrally supported by an entity which has reportedly been cashing out.\nThe writer says:\n \u201cIf I want to use a centralized website for social networking, I'll use Facebook and Twitter which already have mass adoption. Steem is simply an overly complex scheme intentionally designed to steal from the under-informed. \u00a0Ask yourself, \"If the website is centrally hosted, how do they intend on dealing with take-down requests?\" \u00a0They don't, because they don't plan on Steem lasting this long. \u00a0It's a quick money grab, and that's it. \u00a0With Synereo, nothing is centrally hosted and none of the decentralized nodes in the network know what is being stored on their disks, because everything is encrypted.\u201d \nBanano added that while Steemit is the \u201cWonder Bread of social media, Synereo will be the place for controversial content similar to Wikileaks and Snowden!\u201d adding that the fact Steemit is \u201cMathematically guaranteed to collapse\u201d has been widely published online.\n \u201cJust a black box to take a flyer on\u201d \nDespite highlighted flaws in the amount of \"Steem Power\" the founders reserved for themselves and it\u2019s not being an open source, d5000 says some of \u201cthe underlying fundament(al)s of Steem are actually good and well thought-out.\u201d\nZer0Sum claimed Steem \u201cwas ninja-mined among widespread disinterest just like BTC,\u201d adding that leadership and decentralization are mutually exclusive but cites a concern that Steemit has no real content plan or roadmap as social networks don't evolve \"organically\" but are planned, targeted and built brick-by-brick. The writer added that Steemit could succeed if they become highly focused while claiming that \u201cSynereo is just a black box to take a flyer on.\u201d\nNed Scott says that Steemit is currently working to improve the website and contribute to the open source development of the blockchain, as well as provide support to entrepreneurs building third party apps.\nHe explains:\n \u201cSteemit has developed a roadmap that outlines how we and other Steem-based businesses can begin to connect six ecosystem verticals for full-stack Blockchain-based social networks from Blockchain Payments and Rewards, Social Media \u00a0and Networking, Identity Management, Account Recoveries and Password Recoveries, Steem-integrated Marketplace and Private messaging, Sidechains, WREN Virtual Machine and Plug-ins, to Smart Contracts, Advertisements and Promoted Content. \u00a0In the near term, users should expect better and better performance of Steemit.com\u2019s social media features.\u201d \nMeet the \u201cwhales\u201d\nChristopher Franko, a Blockchain expert at Expanse.tech, says to Cointelegraph that he has a Steemit account and really likes the platform.

Cointelegraph has used, tested, and evaluated each platform and here is a detailed review of the top three Bitcoin platforms in the country.\nCoins.ph\nUsers rank Coins.ph as one of the best and well-rounded Bitcoin applications globally, due to its connections with local banks, remittance networks, corporations, and merchants which enable users to do pretty much anything with Bitcoin. Coins.ph allows users to settle utility bills, pay tuition fees, credit card payments, purchase mobile credits, and purchase and sell Bitcoin through remittance branches, ATMs and banks.\n\nOne of its most intriguing services is the 24/7 cardless ATM Instant Payout, which allows users to cash out Bitcoin at the nearest bank ATM at any time of the day without transaction fees. Users can literally visit any bank ATM located in the Philippines and cash out their Bitcoin without any additional processes. A mobile pin number and authentication code sent to your email is all that is needed.\nOriginally, Coins.ph debuted as a Bitcoin-based remittance network. To this day, Coins.ph continuously improves its remittance services to make it easier for families and friends to receive payments. The majority of employees in major cities like Manila or Cebu support their families in the provinces with the salaries they receive. The most common method of sending payments around the country is the Lhuiller remittance network, but it charges substantially higher transaction fees and it is difficult to access for those families living in the countryside.\nCoins.ph created a service called Door-to-Door Delivery, specifically for families who live in the province so that their familiy member who works in the city can send them payments to their home by delivery networks such as LBC.\nOverall, Coins.ph offers 10 Bitcoin purchase and selling methods. The list can be seen below.\n\nThe bank method allows users to select from all of the region\u2019s banks, which total up to 28 banks and tens of thousands of branches.\nOne disadvantage of using Coins.ph is its compliance with KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations which force users to verify their addresses and government issued IDs. To maximize the daily spending limit, users are required to take a selfie holding the government issued card. Although the customer service is top-notch, it can be difficult for users who are permanently based in the Philippines to go through all the verification stages.\nIn general, Coins.ph is definitely the best Bitcoin platform and application I\u2019ve ever used in Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, and the U.S.\nBuybitcoin.ph\nThe oldest Bitcoin platform and exchange in the Philippines, Buybitcoin.ph remains one of the most reputable Bitcoin exchanges in the country. Its simplicity and minimalistic user interface has enabled the company to keep a loyal userbase for over three years. \u00a0Unlike many Bitcoin exchanges, BuyBitcoin.ph operates without KYC regulations. That means users don\u2019t have to give up their credentials or sensitive information to buy or sell Bitcoin. This feature of the exchange makes Buybitcoin.ph the most safe and reliable Bitcoin exchange to use in the region.\nThe steps in purchasing or selling Bitcoin on this platform is fairly simple. For buyers, Buybitcoin.ph requires an over-the-counter deposit to be submitted on the day of the order. Once the payment is made, Buybitcoin.ph sends the payment in a few hours. Again, the beauty of this platform is that all that it required from buyers is an email address and, of course, the Bitcoin address for the payment. \u00a0For sellers, Buybitcoin.ph requires a bank account number and the holder\u2019s name for the payment. Once the Bitcoin payment is received by Buybitcoin.ph the payment is instantly sent to the bank account.", "birthday": "2016-08-25T18:08:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-25 17:08:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 25}

These accounting firms are important mainly because they service, in one capacity or another, most of the world\u2019s companies and provide insight and shape opinion of industry leaders across myriad of sectors.\nIt is interesting to see how they foresee the impact of FinTech on the financial sector. While some of the \u2018Big Four\u2019 think that Fintech might be the next best thing since sliced bread, others seem to take a dim view.\nEarlier this summer, they announced a meeting with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants where they are set to discuss the establishment of a distributed ledger consortium. Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PwC will be looking at various Blockchain solutions for the accounting sector just as the R3 Consortium - which has over 50 members - has been doing for the financial sector.\nDeloitte - A Party Pooper\nDeloitte is the second largest accounting firm out of the \u2018Big Four\u2019 and raked in US$ 35.2 billion in revenues in 2015. The company takes a negative view of FinTech overall and see\u2019s the FinTech industry as a disruptor.\nThe company has published a report titled \u2018Fintech - Disrupting the way we bank\u2019. This report is targeted at the Australian market and looks at how various service providers are putting a spanner in the wheels of the big banks in the country. This includes payment platforms, internet giants, p2p lenders, payday lenders and credit decisioning platforms etc. Interestingly, among the list of disruptors the last names are Bitcoin and Blockchain.\nThe report takes a grim view regarding the new kids on the street concluding:\n \u201cTypical disruptive scenarios start with new entrants entering less attractive segments and then \u201cbootstrapping\u201d themselves into more lucrative areas as their capabilities develop (as per the PayPal example), so there is a clear risk to banks as their services are unbundled and addressed by niche players with better agility, technology or customer propositions. Conversely, there are reasons why banks are asked to hold capital and why deregulated solutions have been eschewed. Once the first P2P lender fails and people lose money, then it is likely to be a different story.\u201d \nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) - Drawing Blurred Lines\nPwC is the big boy among the \u2018Big Four\u2019 with a revenue of US$ 35.4 billion dollars in 2015. They ran a global survey of the top financial institutions in the world and polled 544 respondents. These were mainly CEOs and other executives, as well as the management of companies in the financial services industry. They also got insights and data from PwC strategy and platform which is made up of a 50-member team of FinTech subject matter experts.\nThe report they published is called Blurred Lines How FinTech is shaping Financial Services. PwC has identified key trends and seems to think that disruption in the financial services sector will first impact consumer banking and payments. In fact, all major heads such as fund transfers and payments, Investment and Wealth Management, SME Banking, Brokerage Services, Property and Casualty Insurance/Life Insurance and Commercial Banking etc can expect disruption from FinTech in the future according to PwC.\nThe accounting firm is of the view that it is customer centricity that is leading to disruption:\n \u201cAs clients are becoming accustomed to the digital experience offered by companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, they expect the same level of customer experience from their financial services providers. FinTech is riding the wave of disruption with solutions that can better address customer needs by offering enhanced accessibility, convenience and tailored products. In this context, the pursuit of customer centricity has become a main priority and it will help to meet the needs of a digital native clientele.\u201d \nErnst & Young (EY) - Reshaping a New Landscape\nEY seems to take a kinder view of the FinTech industry. The tone of EY is not one of a spanner in the wheels, the sky is going to fall etc. While they do see FinTech has a disruptor, they see it as an emerging trend.\nAccording to EY, which saw a revenue of US$ 28.7 billion in 2015, their survey indicates that 15.5 per cent of digitally active consumers have used at least two FinTech products in the last six months.\nIn their EY FinTech Adoption Index they have looked at what type of person is more likely to be an early adopter, where FinTech is really making headway (Hong Kong!) and what the prospects are of the industry. Interestingly the survey also looks at the main reason for not adopting FinTech and that was cited as \u2018unawareness\u2019.\nEY says:\n \u201cWhile many traditional providers are grappling with how to replace cumbersome, outdated and time-consuming account establishment forms and processes, FinTechs are enabling customers to set up services with as little as one click.\u201d \nEY also has a grim warning for traditional bankers. FinTech adopters, according to them, tend to be young, high-income customers and they are the banking and insurance sectors most valuable customers. The writing is clearly on the wall!\nKPMG - The Pulse of FinTech is Strong\nKPMG publishes a quarterly report titled The Pulse of FinTech. They take a good indepth look at how the FinTech industry is faring. KPMG, with profits of US$ 24.4 billion in 2015 think that there is a considerable growing interest in the FinTech sector.\nIn the latest edition of the KPMG report they covered how even though in Q2 2016 funding has fallen by 49 per cent, the future of FinTech is positive.", "birthday": "2016-08-26T13:05:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-26 12:05:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 26}

However, the overwhelming performance of Bitcoin as an investment and a currency has attracted the likes of traditional investors over the past few months.\nBitcoin as an investment tool provides investors with three significant advantages over traditional investments: liquidity, high market demand, minimalistic trading.\nLiquidity\nBitcoin is regarded as one of the most liquid assets in the financial market today because of the global establishment of Bitcoin exchanges, trading platforms, and brokers.\nInvestors or holders of Bitcoin can easily trade Bitcoin for cash or for other assets like gold and cryptocurrencies instantly, with low fees, unlike shares of a company or publicly traded funds that require the operations of a third party institution like a stock exchange to process and settle orders.\nRegions like Venezuela, Brazil, and Argentina that are known for its strict and rigid financial regulations that disallow the trading of foreign currencies and assets also have their fair share of Bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms, which enable holders of Bitcoin to transfer their wealth outside the country, bypassing the country\u2019s government.\nThe high liquidity of Bitcoin creates a viable ecosystem for investors to trade in, especially those that are looking for short-term profit. The digital currency is also a practical long-term investment, because of its particularly high market demand.\nHigh Market Demand\nTraditional investors quite often question the demand and value behind Bitcoin. Investors that have limited knowledge in technology struggle to understand the economics behind Bitcoin and how its market value is determined. Ultimately, like any asset in the market today, the value of Bitcoin is directly dependent on its demand.\nUnless the demand for Bitcoin completely evaporates, the value of Bitcoin will continue to increase.

Without a central authority in place to authorize payments or impose arbitrary fees and limits, a user can send their Bitcoins to any other user in the world, at any time, without regard for national borders, distance, or regulation.\nUnfortunately, this lack of regulation is both a blessing and a curse - a great many people have become victims to all kinds of scams, fraud and hacker attacks.

Cointelegraph has looked into the issue of trust to find out why is there such a distrust for cloud mining and how should one approach this technology in a safe way.\nTrust issues\nLike any other investment area, cloud mining presents certain risks. To begin with, there\u2019s no country where cloud mining is regulated by law. Against this background, fraudsters have broad opportunities to deceive cryptocurrency holders and investors.\nAccording to different estimates, the volume of fraud in this market ranges between 50% and 90%.\nAt the same time, the situation is compounded by users themselves. It frequently so happens, that miners, due to inexperience, get lost in lots of aggressive advertising, forum promotion and fake reviews.\nEventually their money falls into the wrong hands, and as a result, misguided investors fill the Internet with negative opinions.\nThe already shaky trust for cloud mining companies was undermined even further in the end of June. Back then, the community\u2019s attention was focused on HashOcean, the service that disappeared with the money of 700 000 investors and tried to make it look like a hacker attack.\nAt the heart of the scandal\nThe BiteMiner project launched around the same time. The coincidence of these two events naturally led to some suspicions: many topics started appearing on the web, where users did their utmost to link BiteMiner creators to the infamous HashOcean.\n\u201cIt affected our business in many ways. Many people treated us as a scandal, some of them asked for refunds on our email,\u201d tells a representative of the company.\nHowever, evidence for this theory remains elusive. The only thing known today for a fact, is that BiteMiner is a company that has more than 2 million users and two data centres in San-Francisco \u00a0and Singapore.\nIn the two months of its existence, the company has managed to get a reputation good enough to get into the Top 10 list of cloud mining investment services.\nNumbers before opinions!\nIt is not easy to find out whether or not a service is trustworthy. As we have already said, one should not to believe paid online reviews.\nIs there any honest source of information at all? We would suggest to pay attention to the numbers - more precisely, to the profitability.\nThere is a certain category of companies that should be blacklisted by every investor. Their implausibly high ROI makes them stand out among other cloud mining companies.

It also showed that there are enough people who share the idea that Ethereum transactions are meaningful - The DAO approved a proposal; the contractor and DAO token holders perceived a transfer of value.\nThough millions of dollars are locked up in Ether, not a single person has been required to acknowledge the Ethereum transaction.\n\nZero dollar DAOs\nDespite these opportunities however, an attempt to create a new DAO now will face a tough hurdle particularly in making people put their money into a complex contract. Hence, the proposal to build useful shared ideas which unite people in purpose without the ability to convince thousands of people to part with their hard-earned Ether.\nAccording to Babalola, who founded Benefactory as a ConsenSys product, the idea is a revisit to the one token, one vote concept of The DAO - assigning voting rights up front to people who deposit funds. Now, the barrier to entry is being removed by assigning those rights later instead.\nBabalola says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cBenefactory commonwealths are zero dollar DAOs. The big difference from existing DAO concepts is that commonwealths don't hold funds. Instead, the funds go directly to grant recipients, but the grant contracts keep track of how much each person has contributed. A commonwealth is just a collection of crowdfunded grants toward a shared mission. Contribution amounts can be displayed to the public, but more interestingly, the amounts can be consumed by other contracts. A voting contract like Carbon Vote can easily be built which uses commonwealth contributions instead of ether, so commonwealths can speak with one voice and democratically decide what counts toward the commonwealth\u2019s mission.\u201d \nWhat to expect", "birthday": "2016-08-16T11:30:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-16 10:30:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 16}

Besides lands found almost in the middle of nowhere, ancestral ownership and transfer of such remains an unbroken tradition in defining the ownership of landed properties.\nThere have been numerous cases involving the claim of property between the nation state and the local custodians. This occurs mostly when there is the need for the government to acquire such a property for the purpose of development or infrastructure. Most of the time, conflicts arise due to the certification of the true ownership of such lands and suggested compensation plans.\nBitland initiative\nChristopher Bates of Bitland says that using Blockchain-based registries to keep records of land titles in rural areas is what his company initiative is all about. He adds that this will help governments at all levels to maintain a proper inventory of their real estate. He goes on to say that this is happens even though most rural areas are usually without high speed Internet and, in many cases, without electricity. \u00a0\nBates says:\n \u201cOur initiative is focused on a full stack solution which brings local physical infrastructure in the form of Bitland Centers that have solar-powered wi-fi networks, as you cannot have Blockchain solutions without the Internet, and you cannot have the Internet without electricity.\u201d \nFirst official ICO and partners\nBitland has announced its first official ICO which is slated to begin on August 22 2016. Bates says that the ICO is targeted at raising between 4000 and 5000 Bitcoins to outfit the first Bitland centers located in Ghana and Nigeria. \u00a0\nHe explains that as the global operations are scaled up, Bitland is looking to get government contracts to fund the future centers so that the governments are the ones funding the development and not the populations that they are trying to protect. In other to achieve this target, Bitland is partnering with OpenLedger, CCEDK, and officially have Kottackal as an external auditing partner to audit their operations.\nBates explains that OpenLedger is the backbone of what is called a \u201cDecentralized Conglomerate\u201d. An ecosystem that allows companies like Bitland to make use of Blockchain technology without having to worry about not having a team to ensure that the technology is kept updated. \u00a0\nBates says:\n \u201cAs a decentralized exchange, OpenLedger allows digital currencies to be exchanged with each other as well as with fiat currencies. CCEDK is a partner who help with marketing and PR. They have a team of specialists who make B2B and B2C contacts, as well as produce literature and content related to the projects using OpenLedger. Kottackal is a company in India that helps tech companies enter the market and get prepared to scale with the global market.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/8-major-bitcoin-debit-cards-how-private-and-anonymous-are-they", "title": " 8 Major Bitcoin Debit Cards: How Private and Anonymous Are They? ", "content": "Cointelegraph contacted the eight major providers of Bitcoin debit cards with the question: Can Bitcoin debit cards really be private or anonymous? Below are the results, categorized by region and level of disclosure required.\nFinancial privacy: Bitcoin vs. banks\nOne of the main advantages of using Bitcoin over traditional funding methods is privacy. When a Bitcoin transaction is sent, its record is permanent and public on the blockchain, but not tied to any particular identity.\nMany users, such as those who frequented the Silk Road, prefer Bitcoin for exactly this reason: it\u2019s anonymous and private.\nHowever, one of the major challenges of using Bitcoin is the limited number of merchants and services that accept it as payment. Enter Bitcoin debit cards, a product that takes Bitcoin and converts it into currency for use at traditional merchants.\nThe challenge with Bitcoin debit cards is that, by and large, they tend to require the same level of financial disclosure of traditional financial institutions.\nWhile this is still an advantage over banks, which can shut down the account of a customer at any time under any pretense (especially under pressure from government), it still does not constitute financial privacy.\nFull\u00a0identification\u00a0(US)\nCoinbase\nCoinbase has a debit card, the Shift card, which pulls Bitcoin directly from the customer\u2019s Coinbase wallet for each transaction. This is convenient, since it saves customers from having to keep their Bitcoin wallet separate from their card\u2019s wallet, and topping up the card\u2019s balance prior to transactions, instead making using Shift one unified, streamlined process. In this sense, Shift is closest to a true Bitcoin debit card.\nUnfortunately, the Shift card is not available in every state in the US, so potential customers in New Hampshire, Connecticut, New York, Hawaii, Maryland, Georgia, West Virginia, Minnesota, and Arkansas are out of luck.\nAs far as privacy is concerned, Coinbase is fully compliant with AML/KYC regulations, and as such requires full customer identification. We attempted to reach Coinbase regarding privacy with Bitcoin debit cards, but company representatives declined to comment.\nBitPay\nAt present, BitPay is the only Bitcoin debit card available across the entire United States, in all of the 50 states. Unlike Coinbase\u2019s shift, and like every other card on this list, BitPay\u2019s card is a prepaid card with a balance in traditional currency (once converted from Bitcoin).\nBitPay requires full identification in order to use its card. However, unlike every single other card, it does not require the submission of any identifying documents. Instead, BitPay requires users to submit a Social Security number during their application process. While this amounts to the same level of financial disclosure as any other card, it is still a vastly streamlined process, making BitPay\u2019s the most painless verified Bitcoin debit card to acquire.\nWhen contacted, BitPay representatives declined a comment to be quoted, but drew from the terms and conditions to answer the question regarding privacy:\n \u201cFederal law requires all financial institutions and their third parties to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who obtains a Card. What this means for you: When you apply for a Card, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, social security number or country identification number, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other documentation bearing your photo as verification of your identity.\u201d \nFull identification (EU etc.)\nXapo\nOne of the main cards in use in Europe and beyond, the Xapo card gained fame for its use by Uber in Argentina after the ride-sharing company was denied service by traditional card companies. The card is currently not available in a long list of countries, foremost among them being the United States. It also requires full financial disclosure.\nAnni Rautio, Product Manager for Xapo, does not think financial anonymity is possible for Bitcoin debit cards, unless Bitcoin is used for a prepaid debit card.\n \u201cAs long as debit cards - bitcoin or otherwise - are connected to long-term players in the market, such as Visa or MasterCard, anonymity is not 100% possible. The only way I can think of an 'anonymous' debit card are pre-paid/pre-loadable debit cards that you can buy at places like CVS. Their function, however, is more like a gift card and those tend to be inconvenient in the long run.\u201d \nRautio pointed out that the main point behind these cards is not maximum privacy, but rather maximum convenience.\n \u201cI'd say the balance between anonymity - or privacy to certain extent - and convenience is providing personal information. Some people prefer convenience over anonymity, others prefer anonymity over convenience. Xapo's goal is to bring bitcoin to the everyday life for people around the world. Our bet is this will happen only if we can make bitcoin accessible, easy to understand and \"mainstream\" enough so that large scale adoption of bitcoin can continue. Today this means that we've chosen to provide a highly convenient product over providing a more niche approach to anonymity.\u201d \nSatoshiTango\nAnother card used by Uber in Argentina, the SatoshiTango card also requires full financial identification. It is available in most countries, excepting the United States.\nMatias Bari, CEO of SatoshiTango, explained that the usual identification requirements are still in place, though are less stringent than those required by banks.\nBari says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cTo open an account at SatoshiTango you need to verify your identity with a proof of ID and a proof of address. We need to apply the proper KYC and AML policies to comply with international regulations. You don\u2019t need the same level of verification than bank account holders but you can\u2019t request a prepaid card or even buy and sell Bitcoins without letting us know who you are.\u201d \nBitwala\nAnother premier Bitcoin debit card by the company that gained fame for its ability to pay bills with Bitcoin, the Bitwala card is also not available in the United States. Notable, and unique, among all the cards mentioned here is Bitwala\u2019s integration with the ShapeShift exchange, meaning that a customer could top up their debit card with cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin.\nJeff Gallas of Bitwala explained that their card requires the usual forms of identification, and that all current Bitcoin debit cards likely require the same.\nHe says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cTo our knowledge, all Bitcoin debit cards on the market currently do require some sort of identification. For the Bitwala Bitcoin debit card (both physical and virtual), we're required to\u00a0undergo certain AML/KYC requirements which include verification of the customers details.\u201d \nHowever, Gallas mentioned that, in the future, Bitwala may be able to provide solutions for those without the proper forms of government identification.\nHe notes:\n \u201cWe are working on offering a solution which is especially targeted at the so-called unbanked, who don't always have the required documents (e.g. because they don't actually own a proper piece of identification). This card could be obtained through providing only same basic details, but would be limited in its total transfer limits.\u201d \nCryptoPay\nMainly a European card, CryptoPay\u2019s Bitcoin debit card functions much in the same ways as others. It is also unavailable in the United States, and requires the same forms of identification for unlimited use.\nGeorge Basiladze, CryptoPay\u2019s CEO, pointed out that all cards in the EU must comply with similar regulations:\u201cAll around Europe there are common KYC and AML requirements for issuing debit cards.\u201d\nWirex\nFinally, Wirex, recently rebranded from E-Coin, offers a similar style of Bitcoin debit card as the others, along with an easily accessible app. This also means that unlimited cards must comply with the same identification regulations as the rest.\nLimited privacy options\nCryptoPay\nAs previously mentioned, CryptoPay requires identification in order to unlock unlimited user. However, they do provide the option for an unverified card. This means that a customer does not need to provide financial regulation as long as they stay below a very low lifetime limit for the card.\nAsked if Bitcoin debit cards could ever be private or anonymous, CryptoPay\u2019s CEO George Basiladze added that privacy (and not divulging identifying documents) is an option for customers willing to deal with lower lifetime limits for a card.\nHe says:\n \u201cThere are lower limits for unverified users (2500 Euros per lifetime) and higher limits for verified users.\u201d \nBasiladze also had strong words for any who would put on a pretense of providing a full-service Bitcoin debit card with no verification.\nHe concludes:\n \u201cIn case a debit card provider offers full, unlimited and anonymous cards, this means that the operator either breaks the law or is lying, thus users should avoid it.\u201d \nWirex\nSimilar to CryptoPay, Wirex, in addition to providing full-service cards with identification, allows customers to continue unverified for a while.\nWhen reached for comment, Dmitry and George of Wirex confirmed that it is possible for a Bitcoin debit card to be private/anonymous, provided that lower lifetime limits are considered acceptable.\nThey say to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cAt the moment, it is technically possible for Bitcoin debit cards to be private or anonymous. As long as the client is happy with the low card limits, there is no requirement to provide any documents at all.\u201d \nSadly, according to Dmitry and George, the world of completely private Bitcoin debit cards may very well end soon, forcing all customers under government identification regulations.\nThey conclude:\n \u201cNonetheless, the regulation of the prepaid card industry is getting stricter. For example, the limits for unverified cardholders will be lowering soon. A number of reports try to establish links between prepaid cards and fraud/other illegal activities. Therefore, we do not expect anonymous debit cards in the near future, at least based on Visa/MasterCard platforms.\u201d \nFull-privacy?\nOn the extreme of the privacy spectrum is (was? used to be? was only imaginary?) BitPlastic. The company has a bare-bones website reminiscent of early e-commerce sites.\nThe lengthy FAQ promises full anonymity for all cards, but raises all kinds of red flags, including a one-time $3,500 non-refundable loading, zero refunds once shipped, zero possibility of transferring balance back from the card, zero recourse if a pin is lost, zero assistance if the card is lost, and a 5% chance that the card is either lost in the mail or seized by customs (in which case no refund will be possible).", "birthday": "2016-08-20T11:27:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-20 10:27:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 20}

However, they have been in conversation with those who have supported his case and called into question its fairness.\nOrr says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cThe case itself is mired in intrigue, as such that between the US investigators who were embezzling funds from the site even as they were tasked with taking it down, the alleged hits ordered by Ulbricht, and the extra-legal means the US government are likely to have used to track down the site's servers. It's quite impossible to make heads or tails of it all.\u201d \nThus, trying to approach the story of the Silk Road, they wanted to look at the case from the perspective of the crypto-anarchists who have largely thrown their support behind Ulbricht.\nOrr explains:\n \u201cTheir argument is, yes, the Silk Road was a market for illegal goods and services, but the proof of concept is more important than the market itself. That is, if the most extreme example of an online market is viable - a market largely designed to sell drugs - then what's to stop us from creating markets for ordinary, everyday goods?\u201d \nThe creators of the movie don't come down on one side or the other regarding Ross Ulbricht. According to Orr, it would be presumptuous to call him either revolutionary or crazy without ever having met him or spoken with him.\nHowever, he notes:\n \u201cWhat's clear though, is that he has had this effect of making a fairly revolutionary concept seem possible when applied to legal goods and services that we all consume on a regular basis. The real question, then, is what comes next.\u201d \n\u00a0\n    \nBitcoin and cinema\nA few months ago I wrote an essay about Cinema and Bitcoin which aimed at demonstrating that movies reflect people\u2019s attention to specific subjects, as in in the Bitcoin case.\nThe movie industry takes care of a topic when it becomes popular. This way, from 2012 - when Bitcoin began to be famous - more films and documentaries related to the cryptocurrency started to appear. The same thing is happening with the Deep Web, or the \u201cvirtual Sodom and Gomorrah.\u201d \u00a0After the Silk Road and Ross Ulbricht case, this hidden part of the web became more popular than ever, and cinema started to gain an interest in telling its own story about the deep, dark web.\nSince 2014 there have been several good documentaries about this topic: Inside the \u2018Dark Web,\u2019 \u2018Deep Web\u2019 and now we have a new one: \u2018Down the Deep, Dark Web\u2019 by Yval Orr, who Cointelegraph had the pleasure to talk with.\nHe explains how the movie came together:\n \u201cThe idea for \u2018Down the Deep, Dark Web\u2019 started in conversation with Itai Landsberg, head of documentaries at Israel's public broadcaster, after he read about the Darknet markets where hackers were selling stolen credit card numbers. [...]. It was only once we started to delve deeper into the topic that we realized that as scandalizing as some of these markets and similar topics were, there were much more interesting philosophical and political questions which emerge once you start to peel back the layers and understand the ideological underpinnings of what has been dubbed the darknet.\u201d ", "birthday": "2016-08-20T15:10:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-20 14:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 20}

", "content": "Bitcoin and Blockchain are technologies which have the potential to dramatically change the world.\nIf Blockchain technology is deployed rapidly and effectively, we can bank the unbanked, automate contracts and even get Blockchains to work with the Internet of Things (IOT) to create a Blockchain of Things. Yet the primary use of Blockchains remains as a medium to validate cryptocurrency transactions.\nIf that is the case, one must ask the question, how soon before central banks not only accept Blockchain but also start to have more acceptance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? After all it is the central banks who run most of the world\u2019s currencies and they are the ones who stand to gain the most from this emerging technology.\nCentral banks are toying with crypto\nIt is no secret that central banks have been embracing Blockchain for a while. The Dutch central bank DNB has even run an extensive experiment on a cryptocurrency\u00a0of its own. We also know that the Reserve Bank of India is toying with Blockchain and so is the Bank of England. Now however, central banks are going one step further and are thinking of printing their own Bitcoin.\nThe Wall Street Journal recently reported on this development:\n \u201cA central-bank-issued Bitcoin would be a means for policy makers to completely control the amount of money in the economy, much like full-reserve banking.\u201d \nBanks stand to lose if central banks adopt digital money\nImagine you could own money which is kept directly with the central bank. Or indeed you store money in a central bank coin wallet on your phone but the money is guaranteed by the central bank. Why would you use a retail bank anymore?\nAt the moment paper money is usually held in savings or checking accounts for safekeeping and also because of the convenience factor, but it also comes with a risk.\nPrivate banks can fail and indeed there are many cases in which they have done so. Should there ever be a scenario in which central banks issue digital currency, the goose of the private banks would be truly cooked.\nBlockchain maybe left out of the equation\nWhile on the face of it there is every possibility that we are heading for a future in which central banks will embrace Bitcoin and Blockchain, it may never happen. There are chances that Blockchain can be one of those technologies that almost made it to the mainstream but never quite did.\nAs Simon Dixon, CEO BnkToTheFuture.com says:\n \u201cI don\u2019t think central banks will use Crypto Currencies and Blockchains but I am certain that they will use a digital currency for three reasons. \u00a0Firstly, they prefer to track all digital currency transactions as a replacement for fully anonymous cash. Secondly, if there is a black swan crisis again in banking they can replace all bank deposits with a central bank digital currency. Finally, they can become a technology provider that allows FinTech companies to build on top of a central bank digital currency through a central bank API to increase competition in banking.\u201d \nLife in a paperless world\nHowever, there is another side to the story as well, a story which has a happy ending. Central banks could put Blockchain and Bitcoin to extensive use. So much so that there maybe is a future in which you see no paper currency whatsoever.

However, many members of the cryptocurrency and Bitcoin communities criticize the existence of app coins, questioning their legitimacy and real market values.\nThe emergence of Steem and other multi-million dollar altcoins in the market have triggered a massive resurgence of app coins, or crypto assets utilized by decentralized platforms as their native forms of payment. Some developers and companies have created business models entirely based on app coins, with operations and governance heavily reliant on the performance of its built-in crypto assets.\nUnique decentralized environments and financial networks\nOver the past few years, platforms like Storj and Steem have attracted interest from cryptocurrency users and investors due to their unique operations and services based on crypto assets. Steemit for instance, enables users to incentivize content providers and creators with its built-in app coin called Steem, which is now worth around US$165 million.\nThis feature and ability of app coins which allow businesses to establish their own unique decentralized environments and financial networks have been praised by some experts including Ehrsam.\nEhrsam wrote in a blog post:\n \u201cIt is projects creating their own economic ecosystems to make the entire thing tick. More precisely, it is about an entirely new business model that is being created and tried for the first time: a decentralized business model.\u201d \nPonzi schemes?\nIn contrary, many members of the cryptocurrency community and industry have called out app coins like Steem for mimicking the models of ponzi schemes that are often built to raise money from investors but provide very little financial benefits to its users.\nTuur Demeester, economist and Editor in Chief at Adamant Research voiced his concern about Steem on social media regarding the app coin\u2019s technicalities and legitimacy.\n As I said before, have serious concerns about $STEEM.

Practical Tips ", "content": "To prevent more cases of theft and security breaches in the future, Bitcoin users must implement alternative solutions and strategies to control their own money. Here are some simple yet effective methods.\nFirst thing to understand about Bitcoin\nThe Bitfinex security breach, which led to the cumulative loss of nearly US$70 million, has become a painful but important realization for most Bitcoin users in the community. It has served as an urgent wake-up call for users who have relied on Bitcoin exchanges to store large sums of funds in contempt of several major hacking attacks that have stolen millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin from exchanges.\nBefore exploring different methods in securely storing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it is important to understand that the Bitcoin network lacks a central authority or an organization which can conduct similar operations as banks.\nThe decentralized and transparent nature of the Bitcoin network makes it virtually impossible for users to reverse their funds in an event of a hacking attack or theft. Thus, proper methods and strategies must be employed to protect user funds from being compromised.\nPurpose of exchanges\nThe primary purpose of a Bitcoin exchange is to enable customers to trade Bitcoin with other assets or currencies like the USD or EUR. It allows users to purchase and sell Bitcoins using traditional forms of payments, such as bank wiring, credit card transactions, and checks.\nWhile an exchange has the duty to protect user funds securely in their systems, the operations of a Bitcoin exchange heavily rely on instantaneous transactions which are performed on hot wallets because of their requirement to send and receive Bitcoins upon the settlement of trade orders.\nTherefore, it is important for users to utilize the exchange for its primary purpose, and move the funds once they purchase or sell their Bitcoin to a Bitcoin wallet.\nNon-custodial wallets", "birthday": "2016-08-11T17:38:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-11 16:38:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 11}

Is Ethereum\u2019s price ready for long-term growth, or will the negative news negatively impact the ETHUSD market?\nTime to choose a long-term direction\nCointimes news platform has accused Ethereum developers of being partially guilty in the theft of 750 thousand ETC. The money was distributed across several exchanges. Poloniex was used to withdraw a large part of 500 thousand ETC. The rest 250 thousand were transferred to accounts on the Kraken exchange. However, the exchanges\u2019 administrators have frozen all assets which they\u2019ve received.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Ethereum Foundation denies all accusations levelled against it, and that the funds were transferred after multiple complaints from the holders of The DAO assets. Ethereum Foundation representatives claim that the transfer was conducted in secret in order to avoid speculation and misinterpretation. The funds are left to stay on the exchange accounts, with parts on wallets, whose addresses were revealed to the public. The developers claim that they are doing everything in their power to resolve the current situation ASAP.\nEthereum price situation\nEthereum\u2019s price has stopped and rebounded from the key level we\u2019ve found near $12.5. The market will decide wether the flat will continue or Ethereum\u2019s price will begin a deeper fall at that mark. In that case, the long-term resistance line will be near the accumulated volume area at $5.\n\nThe level, where ETHUSD is being traded at the moment, could prove decisive, because the choice of the long-term direction (change of cycles) usually happens in points like that. As is known, one cycle is always changed by another one. We\u2019ve said, and, more importantly, showed that many times. The downward movement has become of a larger scale than the last subwave of the upward trend. That means that there is a movement of a larger scale underway.\nThat\u2019s why we have three possible scenarios: continuation of the long-term growth, continuation of the long-term correction, and a flat.\n\nIn the first scenario, Ethereum\u2019s price has to pass at least two key levels: $12.5 and $14.

With the deadline for its implementation approaching, European banks have started to realize the magnitude of the proposed changes in regulations and try to decide upon a strategy which would allow them to react to these changes accordingly.\nWhat all the fuss is about?\nPSD2 sets out to standardize, integrate and improve the efficiency of payments within the European Union, offering consumers better protection and service through innovation and cost savings. It also aims at facilitating a competition in the payments market, which would eventually mean more options for customers. But at what price this objective is to be achieved?\nThe directive forces banks to provide account information to third parties through application programming interfaces (APIs) which cut out transaction intermediaries. And it has significant implications for banks. Sharing their customer\u2019s data with anyone who holds a required license brings new opportunities for existing players, and significantly simplifies the entry to the banking and payments scene for new service providers.\nThe question for banks now is whether to eat or to be eaten. Silicon Valley Token might have the solution for banks.\nBringing control tools back to banks\nToken\u2019s platform was officially launched at the EBAday event in Milan in June.\nAs presented by CEO Steve Kirsch:\n \u201cToken was designed to meet the needs of payments in the digital age; it is a simple, powerful, extensible and secure transaction network which enables banks to establish PSD2 compliance virtually overnight.\u201d \nCointelegraph spoke with Marten Nelson, VP Marketing and Business Development, to know more about developed solution.\nPowered by smart tokenization and public-key cryptography, Token provides the industry's simplest and most secure open API which enables money transfer capabilities and access to bank account information as determined by the PSD2 regulation, while keeping the banks in control and allowing them to generate new revenue.\nThe Token solution is delivered as software and is a snap to integrate with the bank's infrastructure. In addition to regulatory compliance, banks benefit from increased revenue, significantly better security and the avoidance disintermediation.\nImproving customer experiences\nWhile helping banks to seize the opportunities offered by PSD2 and create a win situation for the business, Token opens doors to better customer experience.\nNelson explains to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cCustomers gain easy control of their banking information and are safeguarded against breaches.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/6-cards-battle-for-bitcoin-supremacy-bitcoin-debit-card-comparison-test", "title": " 6 Cards Battle for Bitcoin Supremacy, Bitcoin Debit Card Comparison Test ", "content": "Today, we\u2019ll take a look at six of the market\u2019s best Bitcoin debit cards. We\u2019ll look at where it all started and how far we\u2019ve come, and then declare a winner.\nMaybe, in the year 2025, the vast majority of the mainstream world will offer a Bitcoin payment option just as ubiquitously as they do PayPal. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day, and Bitcoin has made a lot of progress in seven years. Yet, Bitcoin\u2019s advanced peer-to-peer payment system will have to ride the rails of the rather ancient 1950\u2019s-based debit card technology until the world catches up to \u201cThe Future of Money.\u201d\nIt is a clear case of taking one step back to take several steps forward, at some point in the future. If you have not yet seen it, Andreas Antonopoulos brilliantly explains this rather clumsy game of technological leapfrog through the course of human history here.\nEventually, the superior technology wins out, but we are still a few years away from that event horizon. Until that day comes, you and I are stuck using debit card technology, whose only technological update worth mentioning is a metallic chip on the front of some offerings. Many still do without, with little or no consequence.\nThe world still runs on plastic, so the Bitcoin business community has begun to offer more and better debit card options over the last three years. \u00a0Let\u2019s start with the first one to hit the market, back in 2013.\nBitPlastic\nIf you go to\u00a0BitPlastic\u2019s website, their site\u2019s graphics will mention, more than once, that it is \u201cThe world\u2019s only Bitcoin debit card.\u201d This was the first Bitcoin debit card I had ever seen, back in 2013, when the others were still a gleam in a corporation\u2019s eye, but the world has changed a lot in three years. Bitplastic? Not so much. Their terms are still much the same as they always were, but it still has some solid market benefits that could prove useful, depending upon your needs.\nIt comes with a Bitcoin wallet, an online shopping cart to accept Bitcoin payments on your website, and a PayPal Exchange. The card does not require any identification to receive, taking any future identity theft through centralization of your information out of the equation.\nTheir web services are also TOR compatible. BitPlastic actually encourages you to use a fake name and TOR email to get started. Since it does not require your ID, your name is not printed on the card. This is a double-edged sword, as you can take money out of ATM\u2019s anonymously, but it can be difficult to find an offline merchant who will accept a nameless card at checkout.\nMany websites will also fail to process a card with no name. They do use Visa, the world\u2019s largest merchant processor, so no demerits there, but if you lose the card, you\u2019ve also lost your BTC. Cripes!\nThe terms of service are where BitPlastic starts to lose a lot of steam. Getting the card costs 0.25 BTC, which right now is almost $150 USD, and subject to change, so it is by far the most expensive card you can buy. Daily ATM withdrawal limits are still just $200 USD. ATM fees are low at $1.50 USD, but there is a 5% conversion fee for moving Bitcoin into cash on your card.\nAnd it also does not appear to offer an option to use other global currencies, only the U.S. Dollar. America was the only real Bitcoin market for Bitcoin, back when BitPlastic began.\nBeing the first Bitcoin debit card is to be respected, but the market has passed the card by, not just the site\u2019s graphics. BitPlastic should update all of the above.\nShift\nShift works in association with the ever-popular Coinbase wallet, Dwolla, and Visa, so it has a strong foundation to operate from, and millions of potential consumers to assist.\n\nThey market themselves as the first U.S. debit card. This is significant in that regulations have limited the access of some Bitcoin card companies to the U.S. consumer. Some have found a way around these pitfalls and Shift is one of them.\nBenefits include a responsive mobile app for \u201cimmediate spending notifications,\u201d no charge for domestic transactions, nor any conversion fee from BTC to fiat. The card itself is fairly priced at $10 USD.\nIssues are not insignificant. It is only available to U.S. consumers, and even then, not in all 50 states (45 states at this time). Daily limits are $1000 USD without identification, but for those who submit documentation, these can be raised if you email them. Dwolla account users can get $500 per day from an ATM. Coinbase is limited to just $200.\nShift is a solid debit card, but can only play in one market and one currency, and its spending limits are\u2026limiting. Let\u2019s see if we can do better.\nWirex\nWirex has been rebranded last year from the E-Coin card. I, personally, had their E-Coin card, so I can write some experience, but it will lose some relevance, as it was from its previous form.\n\nWirex advantages include a responsive mobile app, multiple currencies available (USD, EUR, GBP), and worldwide delivery brings everyone into the Bitcoin fold. Also, there is no limit to the value of purchases made online when using Wirex.\nPotential downsides include a monthly SMS Notification Fee, higher than average card costs ($17 for the physical card and $3 for a \u201cvirtual\u201d card for online purchases,) and limits on card loads and cash withdrawals without identification. Lifetime ATM withdrawal limit is $1000 USD until verified, so the $200-400 ATM transaction limits are made irrelevant until you submit to KYC/AML. Maximum load on the card is $2500 until verified, but ATM and card loading limits are totally removed after ID submission.\nIn my personal experience, the ATM limits are the same as they were last year. The customer support for my E-Coin card was poor. This may have changed since the rebranding, but I was disappointed and was inclined to look elsewhere, finding another card on this list to use.\nXapo\nXapo is another elder statesman in the Bitcoin community, beginning operations as a company back in 2013. Xapo does serve major markets like China, Japan, Canada, and the U.K.\n\nXapo does not serve most African countries (except South Africa, which it accepts) and the United States. \u00a0Xapo has not been able to maneuver around their regulatory hurdles, while others have, and their troubles there have been well documented. \u00a0\nBenefits include your own Bitcoin wallet and Xapo \u201cVault,\u201d which is free to use. The Vault feature allows far greater Bitcoin security, advanced encryption, offline storage and \u201cmilitary-grade physical security.\u201d\nLocations include Europe, Oceania, and the U.S., which is interesting since they can\u2019t serve U.S. consumers or citizens your Xapo account also allows you to buy Bitcoins directly using five different currencies, and the card converts Bitcoin into USD, GBP, or EUR.\nPotential issues include an above average price (up to $20 USD,) cards can take up to 35 days to be received, depending on your location (faster delivery times \u00a0reserved for Europeans,) and annual fees after year one, which is free. ATM limits are the same as Wirex. $200 per ATM transaction, $200 per day and $1k limit until ID verified, which removes all limits.\nCryptoPay\nIf you look up \u201cBitcoin debit cards\u201d in Google, the\u00a0CryptoPay card comes up first in the results. Does that mean it is the best debit card? Let\u2019s see.\n\nBenefits include access via the three major currencies, you can buy the card with these currencies, or with Bitcoin, and they ship for free anywhere in the world. You\u2019ll get faster delivery times in Europe, which is about 5 business days.\nThe card price is slightly above average, at $15 USD/EUR/GBP. They offer 3-day shipping with DHL, but the prices can go up to $75 USD. Like Wirex, you also have to pay for a \u201cvirtual\u201d card, this time, $2.50. And there are monthly service fees for all their cards, even the one that doesn\u2019t really exist, so you get two monthly fees. There is also a 1% card loading fee as well.\nBitPay\nNow we come to the newest kid on the block, the\u00a0BitPay debit card. \u00a0This card has only been available for three months, and I personally own one of these cards. As you can see, it does not have one of those metallic chips in the front, but it not limited its usability to me.\n\nBenefits include the highest limits of this comparison, without verification. Each card can hold up to $25,000 in funds, and up to $3,000 can be withdrawn daily, $750 at a time, all highest in this review. This removes the need for any verification at all.\nNo documentation is needed and the card costs a low $9.95 to obtain. You can set up direct deposits on the card, if you get paid in Bitcoin, through your personal account website. And there also is no charge to change your PIN (most cards here have a $1 charge.)\nDemerits include it is only available to U.S. citizens, and you can only buy one with Bitcoin, not fiat. Other currencies also are not available at launch. They only ask for an SS#, date of birth, name, and address in their online order form.\nMy personal experience is that the card has been exactly what I would want in a Bitcoin debit card. Transfers into dollars can be done in less than 60 seconds. The online account is easy to use and customer support has been solid. No docs needed for high limits were really what I wanted. I have not had one issue since receiving the card.", "birthday": "2016-08-13T12:54:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-13 11:54:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 13}

As recently as August 3, 2016 The Guardian reported that 120,000 Bitcoin worth US$ 78 million were stolen from Bitfinex, a Hong Kong based exchange.\nBack in 2014 Mt. Gox, a Tokyo based Bitcoin exchange responsible for handling as much as 70 per cent of Bitcoin transactions went under. The reasons for Mt.Gox\u2019s winding up - mismanagement, neglect and \u2018raw inexperience\u2019 according to wired.com.\nThat disappearance of a major exchange also made \u00a0US$ 460 million vanish in a puff of air.\nBitcoin should have been empowering but...\nThe idea of Bitcoin is that anyone who has access to basic technology such as a mobile phone would also have access to a fully functional bank account by default. However, unlike a traditional bank account there are some differences.\nWith Bitcoin, you are ultimately responsible for your money. You need to keep it safe and secure and you need to make sure that there are no mistakes made in the transfer of money from Point A to Point B, because there is no going back.\nThis immutability, which is typically considered a strength is perhaps also the achilles heel of the Bitcoin system.\nAs an example, if you pay with a credit card and you are victim of a fraud, you might be able to initiate a chargeback and the \u2018bad\u2019 transaction will go away. This is much more complicated when you use a Bitcoin-like system.\nImmutability can cut both ways\nPrior to the Bitfinex fiasco, the most discussed hack was probably the\u00a0DAO heist which cost DAO holders US$ 50 million. The Ethereum community decided to implement a hardfork to try to reverse that damage.\nUnfortunately that ended up splitting the currency itself and now we have ended up with two flavours of Ethereum, the regular Ethereum and a new-old currency called Ethereum Classic.\nCan these forks to reverse dodgy happenings be considered as a form of customer protection like deposit insurance?\nWe talked with Fran Strajnar, CEO at BNC, and he says:\n \u201cWhat happened to the DAO was the world's first citizen asset forfeiture. A user driven bail-out. It was not insurance by definition, nor should it be viewed this way.\u201d \nIndeed many people would agree that immutability is a characteristic of cryptocurrencies which is worth preserving.\nAs Aleksandar Matanovic, CEO of EC District, points out, \u201cI would be very disappointed to see the DAO approach being replicated to Bitcoin.\u201d\nLack of deposit insurance is affecting Bitcoin adoption\nAt the moment the fiat currency banking system certainly has an advantage in the form of deposit guarantee insurance. In the United States such an insurance is given by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). In the United Kingdom this type of insurance is available from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) and many other countries have similar provisions as well.\nIn the Bitcoin world though such an insurance is not available from any governmental body. Coinbase does provide a private insurance cover to its users. The insurance that Coinbase provides is only against theft and \u2018electronic compromise\u2019. They are very categorical in mentioning that \u201cThis insurance policy does not cover damages resulting from a specific user's loss, such as the losses resulting from a compromise of the customer login credentials.\u201d\nWould having such an insurance make a difference to how widely Bitcoin is adopted? Aleksandar Matanovic believes that it does make a difference.\nHe says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cI do think that a lot of people don\u2019t feel comfortable being totally responsible for holding their assets. Add Bitcoin\u2019s complexity and regulatory uncertainty in the mix and there are plenty of reasons for a majority of people to wait and watch rather than get involved.\u201d \nAnother point which is worth considering is institutional investors. Presence of deposit guarantee insurance could attract more investments into Bitcoin as well.\nFran Strajnar makes a point about this issue:\n \u201cLack of deposit guarantee on exchanges is a concern for the buy-side. Some guarantee would see more institutional investors come into this Asset-Class.\u201d \nDeposit Insurance or similar is possible in Bitcoin\nThe experience of hackings, thefts and mismanagement at Bitcoin exchanges can be seen as a learning curve, albeit an expensive one. Innovative answers to the lack of a deposit guarantee can be brought out from within the Bitcoin community as well. Deposit insurance like products, for example, could be offered by private companies.", "birthday": "2016-08-13T14:10:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-13 13:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 13}

But way back in 2006, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the man credited with the WWW conception, said that the vision of the Semantic Web was \u201clargely unrealized\u201d.\nFor many this proclamation definitively sounded the death knell on an ambitious area of research. Google trends is an easy mechanism for confirming this dismal state of affairs, and it seems safe that the notion of the \u201cSemantic Web\u201d can now take up its mantle in the dustbin of history.\n\nBut in our haste to disregard this formerly compelling avenue of exploration we might do well to remember Lazarus or Napoleon, or, for that matter, the once completely infeasible notion of digital money. \u201cYou\u2019ll never step in the same river twice\u201d, said \u200aHeraclitus, but some dead ideas have an uncanny way of them of coming back with a vengeance.\nSemantic Renaissance\nThe dark ages describe an era of European history wherein much of the culture and civilization established under the Roman Empire was forgotten or disregarded until the epoch we know of as the Renaissance.\nThe latest and greatest trend in Artificial Intelligence\u200a is Deep Learning\u00a0which was responsible for the recent victory (or defeat, depending on your perspective) in the struggle of Machine vs. Man over the game of Go.\nThe aficionados of \u201cDeep Learning\u201d are aware of the Dark Ages into which Neural Networks research was plunged by the highly critical \u2018Perceptrons: An Introduction to Computational Geometry\u2019 by Minsky & Papert, a work which did much to precipitate a 20-year freeze on exploration.\nThe same story is familiar to those who have spent any time studying the development of digital money and the ill-fated attempts of the 1990\u2019s at its realization. In 2008, finally there came the fusion of existing disparate frameworks in a novel way which enabled the creation of Bitcoin which gave rise to the Blockchain as a useful data structure.\nUnbalkanizing the Balkanized Blockchain\nThe interchange of homogeneous data facilitated by Blockchain technologies, a new framework for information (value) transmission, might just be the catalyst needed to spur the ideas of the dormant Semantic Web community into reality. This is the lofty ambition at which, in one way or another, a series of projects are currently taking aim.\nRootstock, Interledger, IPLD, and Pegged Sidechains are attempts at breaking down the nascent data silos in the quickly Balkanizing Blockchain ecosystem giving new life to the concept of a \u201cWeb of Data\u201d.\nThe progress of Blockchain technologies thus far has unfolded as a drama of epic proportions and in the context of this development one might catch a glimpse of what its future could have in store.\nBlockchain Development: An Internet Drama\nAct I: The Gold Protocol", "birthday": "2016-08-12T17:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-12 16:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 12}

The reason why none of them work at scale or are secure is because the technology behind Bitcoin is nowhere near as valuable as the largest distributed supercomputer in the world securing Bitcoin and the network effect of its miners.\u201d \nDixon goes on to explain that while anybody can copy the technology as you can any open source code, very few will be able to create anything as secure as Bitcoin because it is easier to build on top of Bitcoin.\n \u201cWhy re-create the internet when it is already being used by everybody? You may have a better feature, but getting everybody to use it is the real value of the internet, just like the real value of Bitcoin is the computer power behind it.\u201d \nBitcoin is already a global phenomenon\nIn his own analysis Kumar Gaurav, Co-Founder and CEO of Cashaa, identifies the unique characteristics of Bitcoin and its associated technology.\nGaurav also describes what he believes will be the systematic procedure that may lead to the anticipated breakthrough of Bitcoin and the Blockchain into mainstream.\nGaurav tells Cointelegraph:\n \u201cBitcoin \u00a0is a completely new product which has a number of features that, altogether, no other product has. Bitcoin is cheap, instant, no frills, and cross-border transfer of values without the need of a physical object. Clearly these characteristics pose a number of questions and challenges to public authorities. Can we seriously think that such a high quality product can be banned by the public authorities of all the world? Realistically not\u201d. \nGaurav predicts that Bitcoin will increase its success and matter in people's lives, which will make regulators more active since it is already happening in the sharing economy: Uber and Airbnb share similar regulatory fluid situation.\nHe continues by saying that to which point Bitcoin will be regulated would be an impossible question to answer. However, he points out that Bitcoin is already a global phenomenon and any \u00a0strict regulation will only have the effect to make the use of Bitcoin more underground and this is not in best interests of any government.\nTherefore there should be a proper balance in regulation which works for everybody.\nImmutable and trustless transference of value\nChristopher Franko, President of the Borderless Charity, and Founder of Borderless.tech, \u00a0expresses his total agreement that the Blockchain is on its way to going mainstream.", "birthday": "2016-08-13T15:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-13 14:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 13}

Over the years the company has made a mark on several areas in which it has come up with innovative ideas and products. They have had a hand in the development of the disk drive, magnetic strip cards, ATMs, Fortran language and much more.\nIt comes as no surprise then that IBM is also behind one of the largest implementations of Blockchain in the commercial sphere. IBM Global Financing is expected to use a Blockchain solution to address disputes in the financing arm of the company and free up tied capital, thus leading to more efficiencies.\nIn order to know more about IBM\u2019s plans about the Blockchain in general and also the upcoming Blockchain implementation by IBM Global Finance, Cointelegraph talked with Gennaro \u2018Jerry\u2019 Cuomo. Cuomo has been with IBM since 1987 and is currently the Vice President of Blockchain Technologies which happens to be a business unit within the IBM Cloud Group.\nIBM\u2019s Blockchain Strategy\nIBM has taken a three-pronged approach to the Blockchain - community, cloud and clients. They continue to maintain a focus on core technology which they do so as a community under the Hyperledger Project of the Linux Foundation. They are also determined to support this core technology by helping client services through the cloud. This allows their clients to spend less time worrying about Blockchain management and more on application development.\nFinally, IBM is using Blockchain for interesting new cases like supply chains, auditing and client engagement. They have come up with IBM Garage which is useful for client engagement and supports Blockchain activity around the world. They have centres in New York, Singapore, London and Tokyo where IBM works with clients on Blockchain oriented design.\nIBM Global Financing brings Blockchain to Real World\nIBM Global Financing is the world\u2019s largest IT captive financier and helps their clients access solutions that they require for their growth.\nThey finance IT hardware, software and services. IBM will soon be implementing a Blockchain solution that will allow them to handle dispute resolution more effectively, making this particular implementation of Blockchain the world\u2019s largest.\nJerry Cuomo, Vice President of Blockchain Technologies at IBM says:\n \u201cYou have this global finance lending network - we run $44 billion a year. And we can make this so much more efficient if we built it on the Blockchain and we shared the lending ledger with our partners and suppliers etc and we actually went into a garage session for a few days and we dreamed about it the first day and we were all excited. The fact that in any given year we see about 25,000 disputes within the lending network and this ties up cash, in some cases it can be significant cash....$100 million at any given time....could be held up in disputes. It should be made more efficient so a dispute did not take 40 days on average to resolve .\u201d \nIBM then ran a proof of concept earlier this year. They tested the use of a shared ledger to do compliance and triggered events which were from ledger to ledger to quickly resolve the disputes to find the last point in time where everything was agreed upon. They recorded 2 years of transactions on their lending network and ran simulations and were able to see that, on average, they were able to resolve a dispute in under 10 days.\n\nCuomo says that the results were exciting and they hope to be able to bring the Blockchain live:\n \u201cWe are going to learn a lot, you know I don't think anyone is going to get to any of these big exciting projects in one step, we\u2019re gonna have to take steps along the way and a dispute ledger is one type of thing that I think will educate us and also bring value, that's why we are very excited about this. So you know we are not just talking the talk with technology, you know the parts of IBM and some of the B2B networks that are also walking the walk, you know by trying out these networks, we hope to go live in the not too distant future with the dispute ledger.\u201d \nNo one Blockchain to rule them all\nIt seems that while a lot of work is being done on Blockchain by IBM and others, there may be some inevitable reinvention of the wheel happening as well.

The market continues to struggle with the implications of this event.\nDrama returned to Bitcoinland last week as Bitfinex was taken for ~120K coins and subsequently the price dropped over $100 on all exchanges.\nThe outcomes of Bitfinex hack\nWhile it initially looked as if they would be able to resume operations within a few days, it now appears as though they might be down for quite some time. Despite the near term hit to price and the logistical effects of such a shutdown, the longer term damage is to market confidence as has been the case in every instance of exchange hacking. That said, the liquidity pool for Bitcoin is now much larger than it was during the Mt.\u00a0Gox debacle and many more options exist for traders and investors now.\u00a0Nevertheless, it will take some time to regain the trust of those who have now been burned by yet another major crypto marketplace.\nMoving on to the technicals, we first want to take a look at a 15-minute chart of the price action before and after the hack announcement (via Cryptowat.ch). It has been noted by other analysts that there was bearish price action before the official announcement from Bitfinex, although it looks fairly normal in terms of what we have historically seen in these circumstances.\u00a0A classic spike down followed by a bullish volume breakout confirmed the low at $465, as did an OBV washout and a MACD divergence.\u00a0Now we are on the slow and steady climb out of the hole, and until now things have been moving along nicely.\n\nOther interesting features to note\nNext up is the ever-important daily chart which has some very interesting features right now. For instance, notice that the spike low came all the way down to tag the lower support range before bounce back above there and the medium term uptrend line.\u00a0Additionally, the candle bodies at the lows failed to close below the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level, as well as the bottom of the new pivot zone. \u00a0\nOn the other hand, the price is now back at moving average resistance, and is hitting a hole in volume profile so it will be tough to push through this $600 region without a recharge.

Comparing Gyft, eGifter, Fold ", "content": "While Bitcoin is growing everyday and is accepted in thousands of businesses\u00a0worldwide, the vast majority of retailers around the world still only accept payment through cash or card.\nHowever, luckily for Bitcoin users, several apps allow gift cards to be purchased with cryptocurrency, acting as a proxy between the customer and the business. This allows the privacy-conscious and cryptocurrency diehards to use Bitcoin wherever they go. Several gift card apps make purchasing gift cards with Bitcoin on the go very simple and convenient. Cointelegraph compares three major Bitcoin gift card apps: Gyft, eGifter, and Fold.\nGyft\nPros:\n Largest, constantly-updated selection of gift cards. Sleek, well-designed app. Fast, streamlined buying experience means you can use it to pay at the register without holding up the line. Offline-capable access to gift cards. This means that you can go into a dead zone like a shopping mall and still have access to your pre-bought cards. \nCons:\n Requires one confirmation (recent change!) for Bitcoin transactions. While this isn\u2019t usually a major problem, on high network load days (or with low transaction fees) it could hold you up a long time, which can cause terrible embarrassment if you're standing at the register with a line of other customers behind you. No precise amounts. If you buy something, you'll almost always have a balance left over. While this is no problem for repeat customers, it can be annoying if you want to make a one-off purchase at a store and never go back again. No reward points or discount. Gyft recently got rid of this feature. \neGifter\nPros:\n Zero-confirmation buying. This means that Bitcoin transactions go through instantly. Start-to-finish faster than Gyft. Reward points. You get about two cents for every dollar spent with Bitcoin (more if you're part of the \"insider\" program). Precise amounts! If you know exactly how much your purchase is going to be, you can spend only that and have no balance left over. Great if you're tight on finances or never want to go back to a place again. A referral program which rewards you for signing up more customers. \nCons:\n Longer and more complicated checkout process. If you're trying to buy at the register, you may upset customers behind you in line by taking too long. Requires internet for card access. You can't get to your cards in a dead zone, so you have to get them loaded before losing data access. Slightly more limited selection. While eGifter supports most of the same cards that Gyft does, (and some that Gyft doesn\u2019t) overall the selection is more limited. \nFold", "birthday": "2016-08-08T13:10:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-08 12:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 8}
{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/from-dell-to-rakuten-10-most-popular-vendors-that-accept-bitcoin", "title": " From Dell to Rakuten: 10 Most Popular Vendors That Accept Bitcoin ", "content": "Bitcoin remains the most widely used cryptocurrency, so for many online vendors it's a good alternative to the U.S. dollar. Microsoft, CheapAir and other big retail names have already jumped on the Bitcoin\u00a0bandwagon, with many more to follow.\nTo be fair, most Bitcoin-accepting vendors don't accept Bitcoin directly. They work through commissioned intermediaries, such as Paymium\u00a0and Coinbase, to immediately convert Bitcoin receipts to fiat currency (usually U.S. dollars). They're not in the business of holding Bitcoin long-term, and most appear to be leery of\u00a0Bitcoin's historical volatility. Still, they recognize that growing numbers of consumers see Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as viable alternatives to fiat currency, and they're willing to pay intermediary commissions to accommodate them.\nWith that in mind, here's a look at our top 10 vendors, based on size, user-friendliness, and lowest cost (if any) to the customer, who accept Bitcoin payments.\n1. Microsoft\nWhen Microsoft announced that it would start accepting Bitcoin, the currency's proponents rejoiced. Here was one of the world's biggest tech companies - one of its biggest companies, period - embracing the future of digital commerce. Aside from a brief scare in early 2016, when Microsoft erroneously announced that it would no longer accept Bitcoin and was later forced to apologize (per\u00a0TechCrunch), it has been smooth sailing ever since.\nYou can add Bitcoin directly to your Microsoft Online account. From there, you're permitted to purchase pretty much any digital products and content offered by Microsoft, including Windows apps and games, Xbox games and music, and Windows Phone products. Microsoft doesn't yet allow Bitcoin for in-person or physical product purchases (such as new hardware and hard copies of Microsoft software), though that may change in the future.\n2. Dell\nFormer (and maybe current) arch rivals Dell and Microsoft don't see eye-to-eye on much, but they've both enthusiastically embraced Bitcoin. You can use Bitcoin to purchase almost anything at Dell.com, including physical products. If you have a Coinbase account, you can send payments directly to Dell from there and avoid the miner's fee (well under 1% of the transaction). Otherwise, you can pay with your Bitcoin wallet or scan the product's QR code with your smartphone and follow the prompts.\n3. Expedia\nExpedia accepts Bitcoin payments through Coinbase. Paying for travel with Bitcoin is just as easy as using a credit or debit card, though\u00a0non-Coinbase users do have to accept the small miner's fee. (You can avoid this by creating a Coinbase account, which is a very handy thing to have anyway.) Coinbase users can also take advantage of Expedia's cancellation and refund policies.\nFor\u00a0non-Coinbase users, all transactions are final. Notably, refunds are issued in U.S. dollars at the Bitcoin-dollar conversion rates in play at the time, so it's possible to make or lose money (in dollar terms) on refunds.\n4. Overstock.com\nOverstock deserves special mention - and kudos - for its early embrace of Bitcoin. Back in 2014, the online retail giant became the first major e-commerce vendor to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon.\nThe company's CEO is an outspoken advocate of Bitcoin (and of reducing the influence of central governments and monetary authorities in general). In fact, under his direction, Overstock has put its money where its mouth is - the company is one of the few major vendors that holds\u00a0a substantial amount of its Bitcoin\u00a0receipts\u00a0in\u00a0Bitcoin, rather than converting to fiat currency. That's an implicit, and encouraging, bet on Bitcoin's long-term future.\n5. Newegg\nNewegg, an online retailer who specialize in personal electronics and computing equipment,\u00a0is another big Bitcoin believer.\u00a0Though its 10% discount offered to users who pay in Bitcoin has expired, Newegg continues to promote Bitcoin as a payment method.\nIf your digital wallet is stored on your desktop, laptop, or mobile device, you can simply click the \"Pay with Bitcoin\" button and complete your purchase in a few clicks. Alternatively, you can scan the QR card with your smartphone or click the \"View Address\" button to access cloud-based digital wallets. Note that you can't buy gift cards, marketplace items, subscriptions, pre-orders, memberships, and certain other products with Bitcoin - though you\u00a0can\u00a0receive full refunds (subject to Newegg's return policy) in store credit.\n6. DISH Network\nDISH Network has been accepting Bitcoin payments for its satellite TV and content services since mid-2014. The company appears to genuinely support Bitcoin's mission - it ran a heartwarming feature on the first DISH customers to pay their bill with Bitcoin, and hosts\u00a0a nice novice-friendly\u00a0tip sheet\u00a0for first-time users. Like many vendors, DISH uses Coinbase to accept payments - so, if you're a DISH customer, it's worth creating a Coinbase account if you haven't already.\n7. Rakuten\nOnline retail giant Rakuten is an enthusiastic Bitcoin booster. Back in 2015, it ran an eye-popping discount for Bitcoin users: 30% off anything on the site.\nUnfortunately, that deal appears to be gone for the time being. But Rakuten made waves this July when it announced its intent to purchase BitNet, its preferred Bitcoin payment processor. (We wrote about the news\u00a0here.) The deal is still under negotiation, and its precise implications remain unclear; however, it's rumored that Rakuten could use BitNet's assets to launch an innovative Blockchain-based loyalty program - a first in the online retail world.\nIn other words, even if Rakuten doesn't revive that awesome 30% discount for Bitcoin users, its loyal Bitcoin customers may nevertheless have something to smile about soon.\n8. TigerDirect\nTigerDirect is another online electronics retailer who appear to have gone all-in on Bitcoin - and that bet appears to have paid off many times over. Through the first 18 months of Bitcoin acceptance, nearly half of all Bitcoin-using TigerDirect customers were first-timers, according to\u00a0Bitcoin Magazine.\nWith an\u00a0extensive Bitcoin help section, TigerDirect is among the friendliest for Bitcoin novices. You have three options to pay with Bitcoin: Click the \"Pay with Bitcoin\" button and follow the prompts, scan the QR code with your smartphone to pay directly with your mobile wallet, or click \"View Address\" and copy-paste the URL into your desktop wallet. All Bitcoin payments run through BitPay.\nNotably, TigerDirect allows partial Bitcoin payments when you don't have enough Bitcoin to complete a full transaction. You can make up any difference via PayPal, credit or debit card, or any other TigerDirect-accepted method. Though Bitcoin transactions are final, TigerDirect does offer refunds (subject to its return policy) in dollar-denominated gift cards.\n9. CheapAir\nNot a fan of Expedia, or just want to keep your travel booking options open? CheapAir is among the Internet's most\u00a0Bitcoin-friendly travel booking portals, and the first portal to adopt Bitcoin back in late 2013. As an early adopter, CheapAir quickly became a favorite of Bitcoin enthusiasts, notching some $1.5 million in Bitcoin bookings in the first seven months, per a\u00a0company press release. Today, it actually goes a couple of steps further by accepting Litecoin and Dogecoin as well.\nCheapAir's Bitcoin payment process is seamless and straightforward - literally two clicks and you're done. Payments are funneled through Coinbase. Fees\u00a0are far lower than those associated with PayPal, which CheapAir also accepts.\n10.

Stratfor is a company who provide geopolitical intelligence to individuals as well as organisations across the world.\nStratfor\u2019s publication is called \u2018The Arduous Task of Regulating Bitcoin\u2019 and is available for download here. They forecast that the regulatory uncertainty will continue to act as a deterrent in the wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. \u00a0\nWhy Cryptocurrencies will not become a dominant force\nIn its analysis of the present situation, Stratfor thinks that while the technology behind cryptocurrencies will have a \u2018greater\u2019 impact, cryptocurrencies themselves will face some issues in being widely adopted.\nStratfor forecasts:\n \u201cRegulatory uncertainty will continue to inhibit the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies.Though the U.S. federal government has made progress in regulating cryptocurrencies, uncertainty and ambiguity at the state level will be more difficult to overcome. Blockchain, the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies, will have a greater impact than the cryptocurrencies derived from it.\u201d \nFear of the unknown\nWhat exactly cryptocurrencies are seems to be the biggest issue when it comes to the future of Bitcoin and other forms of digital money out there. This is a question we have addressed in a recent article in Cointelegraph as well.\nStratfor has taken a similar line of thinking and says in the report:\n \u201cIndividuals and businesses must inevitably wait for laws to be figured out and enacted before new technologies can be fully utilized. This has been particularly true of cryptocurrencies \u2014 most notably Bitcoin and financial technologies \u2014 which have been hindered by a lack of regulation and an abundance of confusion.\u201d \nThe status of current cryptocurrency users\nStratfor says in the report that the US Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has issued guidelines under which administrators and exchangers \u00a0(not individuals) are to be considered as \u2018money transmitters\u2019. In the United States at least this means that transmitters are responsible for KYC and AML regulations and their \u00a0adherence. They also have to register with FinCEN. Stratfor thinks this is an onerous burden on smaller companies as well as startups, and some benefits that are traditionally attributed to cryptocurrencies such as anonymity are essentially tossed out of the window.\nCryptocurrency may go the gay marriage way in the USA\nAnyone who follows the news may have noticed in the past years how marriage equality in the United States moved from state to state until finally the Supreme Court ushered it in countrywide. Cryptocurrencies are currently on a similar curve. Only a few states according to Stratfor have issued any guidance on cryptocurrencies.\nStratfor says:\n \u201cRegistering as a money transmitter is relatively simple at the federal level, but receiving a state license in one of the 48 states which requires one is much more difficult and time consuming. New York has made the most progress toward regulating Bitcoin, which is unsurprising considering its place at the center of the U.S. financial system. In June 2015, New York finalized BitLicense, which will likely become a model for other states to emulate.\u201d \nUntil the time the United States receives a nationwide definition of what cryptocurrencies are, we may keep seeing a lot of conflicting laws and regulations and more confusion.\nDo we really need regulations?\nThe fluid situation in Bitcoin regulations leads to some issues but there are many who think that more regulations could mean the end of \u2018freedom\u2019 and defeat the very purpose for which Bitcoin was developed.\nWe talked with Dmitry Lazarichev, Co-founder of Wirex Limited about \u00a0the current state of regulations regarding Bitcoin.\nHe says:\n \u201cObviously we can\u2019t avoid a regulatory framework if we are aiming to reach further Bitcoin adoption, which is supposed to be beneficial for everyone. On the other hand, without standards and rules there are still might be options of how to avoid regulatory requirements. Thus, the Bitcoin community should be embracing the regulation in the first place. The regulators can apply existing AML and KYC rules and monitor legal entities such as exchanges dealing with fiat. However, there are no solid concepts yet in how to regulate pure crypto-to-crypto services and platforms.\u201d ", "birthday": "2016-08-08T18:55:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-08 17:55:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 8}

How Accepted Are Cryptocurrencies Today ", "content": "Six years ago, a cryptocurrency was used as a medium of exchange for the first time - that precedent was later called the most expensive pizza delivery ever.\nMany things have changed since back then, but Bitcoin - not to mention more than 700 altcoins - still only seeks to be considered an adequate alternative to fiat money.\nCointelegraph spoke to Mihir Magudia, \u0421ommunications Director at LEOcoin Foundation, about the potential of digital currencies and the main reasons for the arrest of their development as a method of payment.\nBeing understandable and easy to use is the key\nMagudia believes that it\u2019s important to help people understand the power and potential of digital currencies, and to show them how they can benefit most from it. This can change the way that business is done.\nLEOcoin is a pseudonymous digital currency, which is working within a decentralized peer-to-peer network, entirely on a PoS validation algorithm, and was made specifically for small business owners. The currency was created in 2014 by Learning Enterprises Organization (LEO) - a company specializing in eLearning, eTutoring and skills development for entrepreneurs. Such a background let LEOcoin find 200,000 advocates, young entrepreneurs nurtured on LEO educational programmes, at once.\nMagudia explains:\n \u201cLEOcoin is designed to be easy to use and participate in. Entrepreneurs and businesses need a coin to be stable and they need it to be mass market, that is what we are working on.\u201d \nIs it real money?\nCreating a large and loyal community is not a decisive advantage, albeit an important one. When moving further, every cryptocurrency takes its own path.\nOne of the most popular and straightforward ways of \u201csocializing\u201d a cryptocurrency is to introduce it as a method of payment on all kinds of online shops and trading platforms. Quite predictably, Bitcoin is the absolute leader in this field. The coin is seemingly supported by everyone - from international tech and IT giants to small local companies across Europe.\nAll in all, there are quite a few places where a consumer can purchase a desired commodity or receive a service in exchange for Bitcoins - the numbers are, at least, enough for niche media to publish user guides, and a dedicated stores map to be filled with marks. The situation is more complicated for altcoins, but there is hope - a lot of cryptocurrencies - the most popular ones definitely being on the list, are supported by the CoinPayments platform.\nAdditionally, more platforms are gradually appearing, which make it their principle of operation to \u00a0support new digital currencies (such as Ethereum, Steem, Dash, and others) alongside Bitcoin; one such platform is BlockPay, for example.\nLeoCoin, in turn, is supported by such projects as My LEO Travel and LEOcoin Merchants.\nMy LEO Travel is an online hotel booking platform, which was launched a couple of weeks ago. The range of the service\u2019s features is yet to be expanded: soon the users will also be able to book cars and air tickets.", "birthday": "2016-08-08T19:35:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-08 18:35:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 8}

The time has come to determine the long-term direction.\nWill there be a long-term Ethereum growth?\nAs was determined earlier, Ethereum\u2019s price has gone upwards. There were no signs of a medium-term turn. That was already apparent at the level of $14. Ethereum\u2019s price has broken through that mark, thus pointing at the lack of advantage on the side of the bulls. Simply put, it was a signal for a flat. Consequently, after the price reached one of the limits of the flat, a movement towards the opposite limit should have followed, and it did.\n\nBlockchain lottery and smart contracts\nA Singapore-based company KIBO has presented a lottery platform based on Ethereum\u2019s Blockchain. The key role in that project will be played by smart contracts.\nThe decentralization and openness of the source code will guarantee a fair competition, according to the project\u2019s developers. They also claim that the payouts will be made within several minutes and without any fees.\nThe release of the lottery platform is scheduled for fall, presumably in October. This project has the potential to create demand for Ethereum, which will cause the price to grow.\nFuture Ethereum price trend\nThe potential of the current downward movement could be determined by looking at the nature of the rebound. We need to find the level, where the trend structure should break. We need to find a point, where the majority of the bears will show themselves. That will happen in the intersection area of different technical instruments: diagonal channels of different scales, the correctional Fibonacci level 61%, and accumulated volume. All these will serve as support for a downward trend. In that scenario, Ethereum\u2019s price will continue to fall. If a fortification does not happen, the price will return to the upper limit of the weekly flat, near $14.\n\nThe fiat currency markets\nSpeaking of the world currencies, their prices have reached the bottom limits of their sideway trends. Such a stop could provoke a drop in the dollar price, combined with a growth in most other currencies. That scenario can be beneficial for Ethereum\u2019s price. Important news, which are abundant this week, can cause growth spikes in most currencies. But the main news will be about the US, and will come on Friday. Expectations regarding retail sales and producer price index are extremely negative.

No hacker can penetrate Bitsquare\u2019s decentralized platform as they did with Bitfinex\u00a0because of the presence of a middleman figure, says Mihail Mihaylov, Bitsquare\u2019s Chief Decentralist.\nMihaylov says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cTraditional centralized exchanges are honeypots for thieves. With a single hack or through social engineering, a crook can get their hands on large sums of coins and a wealth of user data. This has already happened numerous times.\u201d \nHe explains ways in which Bitsquare\u00a0is different from traditional exchanges such as Bitfinex.\nNo middleman, no cry\nAs a free, open-source and decentralized software, trading is performed directly peer-to-peer without any intermediaries. It solves the problem of having only one way to acquire a decentralized currency - Bitcoin - through centralized exchanges.\nMihaylov says:\n \u201cUnlike Bitfinex and other traditional exchanges, Bitsquare has no middleman nor a central server, so there is nothing to penetrate. In addition, Bitsquare relies on security through transparency, rather than from obscurity. The application software is open-source, so anyone can review the code and compile their client directly from source to avoid any suspicion of a virus or a back door. User\u2019s funds and data are stored locally, so they are as secure as the user wants them to be. The internal client wallet offers password protection and is funded directly by the user\u2019s own wallet.\u201d \nBitsquare also doesn\u2019t hold users\u2019 funds or data and no registration. Hence, it is not required to follow the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) laws unlike centralized exchanges.. KYC/AML oblige users to register with centralized exchanges using their personal information such as address, utility bills, identity documents etc.\nPlatform with promising features\nBefore and after the Bifinex attack on August 2, owing to a security breach, there have been discussions about Bitsquare on Reddit as a platform to embrace. In a thread, some of its promising features were identified even though there were claims that suggest the platform is still at an early stage.\nA user noted in another thread\u00a0that Bitsquare should be more popular. Others share similar views and suggested features they think should be added to make the platform better and more popular. One such suggestion is for Bitsquare to be able to work not only with arbitrable fiat-transfer methods. However, since Bitsquare enables users to buy and sell Bitcoins with fiat currencies and alternative crypto-currencies, while altcoin trades are executed directly over the Blockchain, Mihaylov says fiat trades require traditional money transmitters.\nAs a result, he added that Bitsquare only supports payment processors who have low risk against chargebacks and sufficient background information to protect users.\nHe says:\n \u201cNevertheless, the team is constantly scouting for additional payment processors that are safe for users. At the current state we support national bank transfer, SEPA, OKPay, PerfectMoney, Swish and AliPay\u00a0for national currencies as well as more than 50 altcoins.

This is shown by the relative stability noticed in recent times which could be as a result of certain factors that have come into play especially within the past year.\nPrior to this year, Bitcoin was subject to volatile swings in its value. While the risk is still there, it appears that only major fundamental events are triggering the same kinds of movements which were commonplace just a few years ago.\nCointelegraph asked experts what could be the reason for the relative stability being experienced within the Bitcoin market and what this implies for the cryptocurrency.\nBitcoin is maturing\nJason Cassidy of Emercoin says the prevailing pattern shows that the Bitcoin market is maturing.\nCassidy says:\n \u201cIndeed, the Bitcoin market is maturing which over time will usher in waves of stability. I expect these to increase over time as volatility decreases.\u201d \nHe continues by saying that as the cryptocurrency grows in popularity and utility it will begin to function more like a currency. People holding Bitcoin will find it more of a store of value which is part of the growing pains being experienced by Bitcoiners.\n\u201cIn the future the bubbles should decrease in scope (smaller % increases, law of large numbers coming into play). Still, there is a tremendous amount of upside left towards the journey to mainstream acceptance,\u201d concludes Cassidy.\nSpeculators have moved to Ethereum\nAlena Vranova of SatoshiLabs identifies a few factors which could be responsible for the relative stability, which includes the creation of Ethereum.\nVranova says:\n \u201cI'd assume that a portion of investors and speculators moved their portfolio to Ethereum. Also the Bitcoin market is on its way to becoming more mature, and there's less panic with sudden swings.\u201d \nMore liquidity, less crooks, increased ability to hedge\nAccording to David Mondrus, three major factors are responsible for the recent behaviour of the Bitcoin market and in a particular order: more liquidity, more players, less crooks.\nFran Strajnar, co-Founder at BravenewCoin, also acknowledges increased liquidity as one of the factors that have determined the current mood of the Bitcoin market. However, he adds that more financial instruments have helped stabilize the price and also that there is a growing number of ways to hedge Bitcoin now.\nChris Pacia, Lead Backend Developer at OpenBazaar, says:\n \u201cI think that it's a combination of a couple things. Bitcoin has been growing more liquid as new markets for buying and selling Bitcoin come online. Typically increased liquidity makes assets less volatile, all other things being equal.

He says that the same goes for Bitcoin before this year as it was the only major cryptocurrency and investors/ traders who were moved by any big or small events.

The odds are stacking in favor of an upward movement.\nIs the long-term correction over?\nThe movement, which has broken through the key support level around $14 is a wave of correction towards the downward trend. That was confirmed by the turn at $12. Ethereum\u2019s price has broken through that resistance and, after fortifying at the $12 mark, formed a turn to decline. As was pointed out earlier, that level was responsible for the balance of power between the bulls and the bears. A fortification meant that the bears are holding the advantage, which has consequently led to the price reaching the minimal target and dropping sharply. Ethereum\u2019s price has reached the minimal target of the long-term correction. That could provoke a continuation of the long-term trend.\n\nThe downward movement which has started at $14 is a wave of the flat. Because there was no fortification below $14, the forces of bears and bulls are now balanced. Since this is a wave of the flat, a reverse movement is likely to follow. The upward movement will be defining for the medium-term scale, because if the price fortifies below the key level of $12, an exit from the medium-term flat could follow. The importance of the $12 mark is confirmed by the accumulated volume in that area, as well as the crossing of Fibonacci grid 61 and the diagonal channel. An exit from the medium-term flat will mean a continuation of the long-term trend, more specifically, formation of a deeper downward correction. If such a fortification doesn\u2019t form, there will be a new upward flat wave, which will stop around $14; that stop is likely to be a short one, considering the pressure of the long-term dynamics.\n\nIn regards to fiat currencies, most of the world currencies have formed upward trends, as was said earlier. Such movement corresponds to the upward correction (fortification) of Ethereum\u2019s price, which was happening before July 29, while the fiat currencies were forming upward trends. After that, the currencies have reached the upper limits of their respective flats, which could exert pressure on the downward Ethereum trend. However, both Ethereum, and the fiat currencies, are not displaying clear signs of the formation of the downward trend at the moment.

Data from the Bitcoin Core over the period from 3rd January 2009 through to the 8th May 2015 was imported and managed via a MySQL database designed to run high-performing application codes.\nResearchers have gathered together publicly accessible individual addresses as the minimum units of Bitcoin identity and grouped them into particular business categories through analyzing some of their specific transaction patterns.\nApplying the input address heuristic, researchers have grouped 75,191,953 unique Bitcoin addresses obtained from the Internet into 30,708,660 clusters which were further filtered to link part of superclusters to real world entities (e.g. BTCChina, Kraken, Xapo, etc.) which belong to different business categories (exchange, mining pool, online gambling, black market and composite). It allowed researchers to further create a map of payment relationships between them and make conclusions regarding transaction behavior in each business category.\nThree Regimes in Bitcoin Economy\nRelying on the results of the analysis of transaction relationships, researchers measured the relative prevalence of each general business category in the sample and tracked their evolution over the study period. Thus, the study identified three distinguishable regimes that have occurred and evolved in the Bitcoin economy since its inception.\nPeriod 1: from January 2009 through to March 2012 - identified as a proof-of-concept period and characterized by test transactions among a small number of users with very little meaningful commercial activity. The analysis showed that this period was almost entirely dominated by mining.\nPeriod 2: April 2012 through to October 2013 - identified as a period of early adopters, bolstered by black market usage and gambling.\nIt was no surprise that these types of businesses were among the first responders to Bitcoin, as they were attracted by its unique features such as its relative anonymity (pseudonymity), lack of regulatory and legal oversight, borderless transactions, and low transaction costs absent from taxation.\nAs study points out, Bitcoin as the new form of secure digital cash appeared to be ideal for the purchase and sale of illicit drugs, stolen items, and other activities that could not be easily paid for elsewhere online. However, there was a concurrent drop in using Bitcoin for \u2018sin\u2019 activities in October 2013 when a number of black markets ( the largest among them was the Silk Road) were shut down.", "birthday": "2016-08-02T15:40:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-02 14:40:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 2}

Transactions on the Blockchain are usually based on automatic execution once the underlying conditions are met. This can be explained by the creation of smart contracts, which eliminates the element of human interference once the process is started.\nWithin the Bitcoin world and the Cryptocurrency ecosystem in general, transactions between crypto users and exchanges is still characterised by human interference, thereby creating room for the need for trust or panic as the case may be.\nCointelegraph asked experts how possible it would be to have exchanges launched on Blockchain platforms, having transactions probably run by smart contracts.\nSecurity is a major issue\nThomas McAlister of AAA Blockchains Ltd says that there are multiple examples of Blockchain technologies facilitating all types of value already in existence. He adds that fundamentally, this is a different issue.\nMcAlister says:\n \u201cEven before a viability consensus has been reached based on fairly general economic conditions for it to be profitable, the greatest issue is security. We have already seen millions of dollars of value stolen from participants of these exchanges over the past few years within the crypto world for which many of these exchanges were shut down\u201d. \nHe also points out that already there is a huge demand for \"BANKCOIN\", indicated by the fact that AAA Blockchain Ltd is based out of Belize due to the fact that:\n They own 100% of the network. They can insure its value. It is a banking crypto commodity which was accepted in United States. \nBattle for acceptance\nMcAlister explains that for those already trading millions of dollars of transactions through exchanges, the Bankcoin can and will facilitate their transactions by representing a trusted medium of exchange. However, McAlister expresses his reluctance to agreeing that any crypto exchange will become widely accepted due to the economic principles just not supporting it.\nHe says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cUnless multiple types of crypto currencies would be participants, I just do not see it as a reality, and I think the financial industry would agree with this opinion, otherwise they would be doing it already.\u201d \nThree most important factors\nMcAlister mentions three elements which must be achieved for Blockchain exchanges to see the light of day. They are trust, security and liquidity.

Will Martino was a lead engineer on the Haskell Desk at JP Morgan\u2019s Emerging Technologies Group while Stuart Popejoy built the advanced technology team for JP Morgan's Emerging Technologies Group which focussed on solutions for banking.\nKadena the blockchain is powered by ScalableBFT, the first consensus-BFT capable of scaling into thousands of nodes. The move by Will and Stuart made quite a stir in the blockchain world.\nOpen Source and big corporations\nCointelegraph asks Will Martino about what he thinks about large corporations using open source technologies if key developers leave and set out on their own projects.\nMartino says:\n \u201cThe decision to open source Juno was a well-executed strategic decision by JPM for the specific purpose of presenting it to the HyperLedger Foundation as a candidate for their technology stack. The decision resulted in JPM garnering significant thought-leadership in the private blockchain space. JPM\u2019s Emerging Technology group has other open-source efforts as well, which it sees as a competitive recruiting advantage to garner attention and hire, retain, and motivate top-notch developers.\u201d \nNew darling of the financial world\nPrivate blockchains are attracting the attention of many banks and financial institutions. However how soon these new technologies will become part of our everyday life is an interesting question.\nWill Martino thinks that these technologies will be witnessed by consumers as soon as financial technology moves through the adoption cure.\nHe thinks features like straight-through-processing wire transfers would be an example of such a tech making an impact on daily lives of people.\nHowever at the same time the biggest beneficiaries would be larger institutions as infrastructure costs for them would decline significantly and they would be able to offer their client\u2019s access to new technology.\nKadena addresses key blockchain problems\nWill says that Kadena is the first blockchain to address the \u2018pressing issues\u2019 of blockchains in a private setting. He says that Kadena does not compromise the core guarantees that a blockchain should provide.\nAccording to him, private blockchains have fundamental problems with inadequate miners\u2019 incentives. Unacceptable performance is also an important issue.\nWill thinks that performance issues are unavoidable but the incentive breakdown can be interesting.\nHe says:\n \u201cIn a private blockchain, all miners are also participants. Is there an incentive large enough to negate the potential business advantage of mining a fork? Legal repercussions could become the new, negative incentive, but if we need a court\u2019s involvement to get mining in private contexts to function can we really still say that mining in this context works? Centralization, e.g. registering transactions in a central 3rd party before mining them, is another potential solution, however that it isn\u2019t distributed and begs the question \u201cwhy are we bothering with mining if we\u2019re centralizing anyway?\u201d \nWhile Classic BFT consensus approaches can and are being used to construct private blockchain solutions they tend to discard too much of the mining security model.\nHe thinks that one potential solution is to abandon public-key signature verification for TLS-connection based authentication but this would only offer ephemeral security in his view as the \u2018proofs\u2019 of authentication are lost when the connection is closed. In his opinion, private blockchains need durable security and every transaction\u2019s authorship should be verifiable and auditable through cryptographic means.\nKadena, according to him, is the first credible alternative because it achieves high performance at scale while still providing durable security in the Bitcoin model.\nKadena\u2019s difference from Juno\nThe why and how of how Kadena and Juno differ is an interesting question and one that we posed to Will. He told us that Kadena was founded on the belief that Tangaroa (Juno started as a fork of this project) foreshadowed a potential breakthrough in blockchain technology.\nHe told Cointegraph that their work on Juno helped inform this belief but ultimately it lacks a full smart-contract solution and has fundamental issues preventing it from scaling.\nTalking about Kadena Will says:\n \u201cOur new blockchain, also called Kadena, is powered by ScalableBFT, the first consensus-BFT capable of scaling into the thousands of nodes. Until now, BFT consensus protocols like PBFT and SmartBFT have faced fundamental problems that prevent them from scaling. ScalableBFT, a \u201cRaft+BFT\u201d-family protocol descending from Tangaroa (Copeland/Zhang), features fundamental innovations that allow forflat scaling. We\u2019re excited to announce that with ScalableBFT, Kadena has achieved an industry first: the Kadena blockchain can process upwards of 7,000 transactions per second with latencies well below 100ms, supporting hundreds or even thousands of consensus nodes. This achievement is even more notable in that it sacrifices none of the cryptographic robustness expected from a blockchain, proving full durable security.

Waterhole to Tackle Blockchain Security Problems ", "content": "Despite being hailed as the best for security, accountability and resilience, Blockchain initiatives seem quite exposed to all sorts of malicious actors.\nMt.Gox collapse has become a byword, but there are other, more recent examples, such as The DAO attack, and the ensuing ETH vs. ETC feud, or the HashOcean hack. In an environment like that, there is a need for secure apps, which care about the safety of their users\u2019 funds.\nWaterhole, a company registered in US, has built an app based on these ideas. It is an encrypted Blockchain-powered messenger, an OTC escrow, and a local trading marketplace, all in one simple mobile app.\nDifferent approaches to crypto apps\nSeven years after the launch of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency industry is still growing rapidly.\nDifferent trends come and go, and new projects appear daily, striving to find their niche and their audience. Some choose to compete in highly saturated markets, such as exchanges and wallets. There are also those who maintain a combined approach by fusing several crypto applications into one solution, or bringing the benefits of cryptocurrency to hitherto unrelated systems.\nThe success of the latter approach was recently demonstrated by Steemit, a decentralized social platform which rewards its content creators. Steem, the cryptocurrency which powers the Steemit network, is right now one of the top three coins by market capitalization, right below Bitcoin and Ethereum - just several months after the launch of Steemit.\nWhat is Waterhole?\nWaterhole is designed in California by Ziqi Chen and Jason Nguyen who have first-hand experience in trading, mining, and ATM operations; the app source code is developed in China and US by top engineers from various universities.\nIts first and foremost feature is the OTC escrow Bitcoin trading. Waterhole allows its users to find buyers or sellers based on location, volume, score, ratings, verification, and more. There are extensive safety measures in place, in order to prevent fraudulent activity.\nIts additional feature, a social instant messaging platform, provides end-to-end dynamic encryption, and in case a user somehow loses their phone, Waterhole has the ability to block the device until a new one is bought and verified.\nWaterhole\u2019s key focus is to provide the images of receipts and verification of uploads as genuine proof of payment, which means that there is no room for photoshopped or modified editing. Users have options to undergo a triple-layer verification process via ID, headshot photo and video verification. After that, the location-based selling feature gives an additional layer of security by allowing users to set up face-to-face transactions. Geo-fencing allows Waterhole to block suspicious activity from particular areas. These verifications will be fully controlled by the trading parties and are not mandatory.\nDealing with scam payments\nCointelegraph has reached out to Jason Nguyen, Waterhole\u2019s COO, and asked him to tell us more about their team\u2019s prior experiences, and their product.\nNguyen says:\n \u201cBeing a mobile-based escrow trading marketplace, it allows us to protect both sellers and buyers as opposed to web-based, which are prone to phishing attacks and viruses. One of our goals is to alleviate the pain produced for OTC users by scam payments.

Why?\nGabriel Kurman: RSK is fully compatible with Solidity and Web3 in order to allow all developers and companies from the ETH/ETC community to have the option to run their solutions with the security of the Bitcoin network behind it.\nHaving said that, it is worth mentioning that RSK\u2019s VM has several security improvements and performance optimizations designed by our Chief Scientist, Sergio Lerner. We have already done some improvements on our Java VM implementation which improved overall performance significantly.\nOn top of that, some of the most relevant improvements to be released in the near future include Contract runtime versioning, Contract Hibernation, Java-based toolchain and compiler for Smart contracts and for next year we expect to offer higher privacy via Zero-knowledge proofs out of the box.\nCT: What is Rootstock's business model? How does it intend to turn a profit?\nGK: We at RSK have decided not to create a new tradable coin, and instead used Bitcoin as fuel to run our contracts. As a consequence, all value created for the use cases in our platform will strengthen the Bitcoin network.\nOn top of this, we allow Bitcoin miners to participate in the smart contract revolution by merge-mining RSK with the same hardware and energy consumption they already use to mine Bitcoin. In this way, BTC/RSK miners will receive 80% of the fuel generated on the RSK Blockchain and RSK labs will receive the remaining part to continue developing the platform, reward full nodes and repay investors.\nCT: What is the latest on Rootstock? Is it out yet? And if so, when?\nGK: The most exciting news this week is that we have gathered a unique group of the most important Bitcoin exchanges and wallets of the world to be part of the RSK Federation. The RSK Federation will provide key additional services to RSK users and most importantly will be a crucial component of the platform\u2019s hybrid security model which will be key in developing large scale corporate and governmental solutions.\nAt the same time we are currently implementing the RSK merge-mining plugin on the pool software of the most important Bitcoin miners and pools around the globe. We expect RSK to be the most secure Smart Contract platform in the world pretty soon.\nCT: Rootstock has been hailed as an Ethereum killer for a year now. What is special about it?

The number of new features, improvements and innovations is increasing all the time. Scaling is just one issue and it does not define bitcoin. Scaling will continue to be an issue as long as bitcoin is growing.\u201d \nJust like Ethereum?\nAntonopoulos says Bitcoin has had two unintentional HF and there is a coming Bitcoin HF which could lead to two coins. Thus, Bitcoin could end up like the Ethereum hard fork experience.\n \"Bitcoin will have a hard-fork, eventually, I think,\" predicts the author of Mastering Bitcoin. \"When bitcoin has a HF, there will be 2 chains after the fork and there will be 2 coins. It is almost guaranteed that some people will refuse the new chain and will remain on the old chain. There are enough people with significant amounts of bitcoin who will never agree to a fork and can afford to keep mining the old chain. Ethereum demonstrated this issue very well.\u201d \nAntonopoulos continues by underlining that in bitcoin it will be much bigger because the \u201cold\u201d bitcoin may be worth as much as all of ethereum (1 billion USD).\nHe explains:\n \u201cIt will not undermine bitcoin\u2019s value very much, but it will cause some chaos with users, wallets and exchanges. This is why a HF needs to be very carefully planned and executed with plenty of advance notice. We also need to learn from Ethereum and consider adding some anti-replay defenses to help users maintain separation of the two chains in their wallets.\" \nIs it risky?\nThe HF has been a thorny issue among bitcoiners since the debate of doing it to increase the block size started over a year ago.\nMost\u00a0Bitcoin Core developers are against it. They cite that it is risky. The Bitcoin Classic say they are hard forking Bitcoin to a 2 MB blocksize limit.

What is Bitcoin and Why It Matters ", "content": "Bitcoin has emerged as the leading cryptocurrency of choice ever since it came into being. In the eyes of the users of Bitcoin, the definition of it as a currency might just be very clear but when it comes to the legal definition of Bitcoin, there is still a lack of clarity.\nDoes the classification of Bitcoin matter?\nDifferent jurisdictions treat Bitcoin differently\nBitcoin is a true global currency and it can be used in any part of the world. In this type of a scenario, it is but natural that different legal jurisdictions take a different view of what exactly Bitcoin is. In some countries Bitcoin is not even deemed legal.\nIn some others Bitcoin is completely undefined, others yet see the status of Bitcoin in flux and some have completely given it a free hand. Then there is the matter of whether Bitcoin is money or a currency or both.\nThe curious case of Michell Espinoza\nOn February 6, 2014 Michell Espinoza was arrested in a sting operation. Espinoza stayed 3 months in Jail and was charged with selling $1500 worth of Bitcoin to detectives who claimed that he was illegally transmitting and laundering the money.\nIn July of 2016 a Miami-Dade judge ruled that Bitcoin is not actually money and all charges against Michell were thrown out.\nThe Miami Herald reported that Judge Teresa Mary Pooler in her ruling said:\n \u201cThe court is not an expert in economics; however, it is very clear, even to someone with limited knowledge in the area, the Bitcoin has a long way to go before it the equivalent of money.\u201d \nThis judgement not only clarifies the status of Bitcoin in Florida but it will have wider implications as well, it also means that those people who were on the fence about using Bitcoin because of its status will be encouraged to use it.\nMichell Espinoza\u2019s attorney Rene Palomino told the Miami Herald:\n \u201cAt least it gives the Bitcoin community some guidance that what my client did was not illegal, What he basically did was sell his own personal property. Michell Espinoza did not violate the law, plain and simple.\u201d \nThe Bitcoin debate in the United States\nDifferent entities in the United States have treated Bitcoin differently. The SEC thinks of Bitcoin as a security or money. FinCEN (The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) treats Bitcoin as currency, while the IRS labels Bitcoin as property.\nInterestingly it was the IRS\u2019 definition that Judge Pooler referenced in deciding the case Michell Espinoza. How the legal authorities ultimately classify digital assets like Bitcoin will definitely shape the future of the cryptocurrency space. \u00a0\nThe way cryptocurrencies will be taxed and used of course will depend on how they are viewed. Mass adoption also requires clarity on the part of the authorities to some extent.\nIn many countries the legal status of Bitcoin falls in the grey area and authorities have simply chosen to ignore the circulation of digital assets like Bitcoin because they do not see the volumes as of any significance.\nIn my home country of India for example while the central bank, The Reserve Bank of India is interested in exploring blockchain technology to fight against counterfeiting, they had previously in 2013 warned holders of virtual currencies in a 5 point press release.\nThe press release stated:", "birthday": "2016-08-05T13:38:00+01:00", "date": "2016-08-05 12:38:00", "year": 2016, "month": 8, "day": 5}

Bain think that central banks have already started toying with the idea of all digital cash.\nBanks face oblivion\nThe effect of a central intermediary supported all digital currency would be felt deeply by the banking industry.

", "content": "The modern government-run financial system employs a staggering amount of national debt. The United States\u2019s national debt is fast approaching $18 trillion, with no sign of stopping. This debt, while incurred by the government, ends up being the responsibility of the public to pay it off, or else risk collective financial suicide.\nHowever, instead of shouldering this massive burden and having economic progress crushed under its weight, there exists a way to use cryptocurrency to achieve the opposite effect for people: give them equity.\nCurrency control stifles business and innovation\nEstablishing by dictat a common, controlled currency for a nation has the effect of economically isolating that area from the rest of the world. By placing restrictions around the medium of exchange in an arbitrary geographic area, businesses with parties outside of that area is made much more difficult.\nCross-border transactions require at a minimum that a currency exchange has to take place, which may be subjected to capital controls, money laundering laws, etc.\nNavigating the banking systems, legal restrictions, exchange rates and so on can make doing business internationally much more difficult than with cryptocurrency, where any transaction to anywhere in the world is the same as any other.\nInflation steals value from people\u2019s savings\nA feature of central banking for government (a curse for the people) is the ability to inflate currency to pay off debts. Citizens holding the currency are forced to watch it devalued, as their life savings are diminished with each new unit printed.\nWhile in countries without strict capital controls it is possible to invest in other currencies or stockpile commodities such as gold, legal tender laws still apply. Therefore, a certain portion of finances must remain liquid in the country\u2019s devaluing currency in order to cover day-to-day expenses, disproportionately affecting the nation\u2019s poor.\nWith high inflation, the rich see losses on whatever small portion of their wealth is forced to remain liquid, while their investments in commodities or offshore accounts remain unaffected.\nThe government profits from the printing of money, as it amounts to value out of nothing for them while they drain value from everyone holding that currency. The poor and the middle class, finally, are affected the worst, since a significant portion of their earnings must remain liquid to cover expenses. For the poorest living close to margins, any change in value of the currency can be devastating.\nNational debt holds the people hostage\nFiat currencies, backed by no commodity and able to be inflated at will, have no intrinsic value. The value they do maintain is based on confidence in the government, its management of the economy, and the strength of that economy. In the event of economic catastrophe, including government mismanagement or default, the currency\u2019s value will plummet.\nWhen a government accrues debt, it becomes the \u201cnational debt,\u201d or the responsibility of the people. This in turn puts an economic gun to the head of every single citizen. No matter how little the people consented to whatever massive debt was run up by their government, they are forced to pay it off whatever it takes, or else risk losing the value of their life savings overnight. By holding the people hostage with the national debt, they can ensure that no one will simply refuse to pay taxes. This extortion scheme is airtight as long as there is no other option for money.\nCryptocurrency takes back control of money\nEnter cryptocurrency to save the day, rescuing the people from the dark, oppressive dungeon of a government\u2019s control over money. To begin with, no cryptocurrency worth its salt can be inflated on a whim, robbing its users of the value of their hard work. The price must be dictated by the laws of supply and demand, and a well-managed currency with a robust user base will see its value react accordingly.\nEven if a cryptocurrency is mismanaged and does its users wrong, they are always free to move on (sometimes instantly, in the case of using a Coinomi wallet and converting to another currency with its integrated ShapeShift functionality), providing a considerable economic incentive not to bungle the currency.\nFinally, using a pseudonymous or anonymous currency means reporting transactions to whatever authorities is a voluntary choice, freeing up commerce that is either illegal, restricted, highly taxed, or otherwise inconvenienced to be able to operate at peak efficiency.\nNational cryptocurrencies give something back to the people\nTraditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin do empower the common man and provide a way out of financial slavery, but their positive effects are more limited to certain groups of people.\nA currency that is mostly (or entirely) brought into existence by miners running a complex algorithm centralizes its benefits around the technological class, making them the gatekeepers of the new financial system.", "birthday": "2016-07-29T12:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-29 11:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 29}

However, the only way to find out was to undertake the experiment himself, and that\u2019s exactly what he did.\nOriginally from Luxembourg, but living in Berlin, Weis first discovered the digital currency in 2012 when his trust in the banks diminished after the financial crisis. Yet, despite people telling him back in 2014 that Bitcoin didn\u2019t have a future, he was fascinated about the possibility of a currency that isn\u2019t controlled by a government and that is immediately available to any country.\nWith the world trip experiment still in his mind, he converted all his savings to Bitcoin \u2013 securing them on his newly bought\u00a0Trezor wallet from SatoshiLabs in Prague. Packing his bags, Weis began his adventure on January 12, 2015. Since successfully completing his adventure, he managed to visit 27 countries and 50 cities in 18 months using only the digital currency to get around. Naturally, he is of the opinion that Bitcoin is a global currency.\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Felix Weis says: \u201cI was able to use it in 27 countries in whatever form and, for me, that makes it a global currency.\u201d\n\nEven though Weis visited countries such as Israel, Turkey, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Japan, Ireland, North America, the United States, Mexico, Cuba, Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, England, and Finland, he states that it wasn\u2019t all plain sailing along the way.\nWhen he was visiting Romania he explained that he was stranded for two days with no way of paying for anything after the guy he agreed to meet up with, didn\u2019t show up to trade Bitcoin for the local currency.\nWeis says:\n \u201cI was able to pay the hotel through Expedia, which had a breakfast, but for the rest of the day I couldn\u2019t get any food. He eventually showed up and bought me food and explained what happened.\u201d \nAfter this he found a website similar to Groupon in Romania, which accepted Bitcoin, allowing Weis to buy vouchers with the digital currency before heading to various places where he could pay for food with his vouchers.\nEven though this was a time when Weis was tempted to cheat and pay with cash he explained that before setting out on his trip he had put three simple rules into place to ensure that he wasn\u2019t tempted to use fiat money. He couldn\u2019t use any banks, no currency exchanges from one country to the next, and no credit cards. Cash could only be traded for Bitcoin, and Bitcoin always had to come first whenever possible.\nWeis explains his reasoning:\n \u201cBanks are very dangerous and poisonous because they are so deeply wired into our economy. I wanted to find out whether it was possible to live without a credit card, so I cut my credit card up and didn\u2019t use my bank account for the whole time.\u201d \nOf course, websites such as\u00a0Coinmap made it easier for Weis to figure out which places to visit where Bitcoin was accepted before moving on to another country.\nAt the time of Weis\u2019s trip the price of Bitcoin had been declining at the end of 2013 after reaching the $1,000 mark and had dropped below $200. However, the more countries Weis visited over the 18 months, Bitcoin slowly gained momentum allowing him to experience unique moments.\n\n", "birthday": "2016-07-26T14:04:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-26 13:04:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 26}

As cryptocurrency seeks to expand adoption, people outside the traditional tech community remain a sought-after demographic.\nCryptoart is a project that serves this purpose of bringing Bitcoin beyond its traditional social circles by creating art pieces related to cryptocurrency and affixing them with paper wallets, allowing the art piece itself to serve as a store of currency. Cointelegraph spoke with Troy Fearnow of Cryptoart about taking Bitcoin into culture.\nCointelegraph: This seems like a very non-typical idea for the Bitcoin community. What was the inspiration?\nTroy Fearnow: As a Bitcoiner I wanted to contribute in some way. I spent much of my professional career dealing art. One day I was printing off paper wallets and came up with the idea to merge them with physical art. It just seemed like a fun way to secure and enjoy my Bitcoin. Additionally, The concept of growing value by creating demand and introducing scarcity is interesting to me.\nCT: Is Cryptoart something that can be used as a way to hide one's finances from theft?\nTF: The art is just a vessel to hold a paper wallet, so yes. The QR code and paper wallet can be switched out. I felt it was important to observe trustlessness.\n\nCT: Any success in the art gallery/coffee shop world as a way to display art?", "birthday": "2016-07-22T17:20:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-22 16:20:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 22}

Like my Mom, for example. She seemed to ignore the 2 years of work I\u2019ve put into the Bitcoin community, but when some mainstream media talking head said Bitcoin was a good investment she demanded I return to Brooklyn to get her waist deep into the digital currency, ASAP. That\u2019s fine and dandy and is probably the number one reason why the mainstream will notice and begin investing in Bitcoin going forward. When my Mom is on board, you\u2019re doing something right.\nBitcoin\u2019s continuously price is but the tip of the iceberg when it comes to reasons to invest in \u201cThe Future of Money.\u201d However, since that is the case, here are five great reasons why Bitcoin\u2019s price will continue to rise in the future, and draw continue to draw novice investors from the mainstream to the world of digital currency. If you are a regular Cointelegraph reader, you may know some or all of these, but a refresher in the summer isn\u2019t a bad idea. If this helps one person see the Bitcoin\u2019s shine through this piece, my job is done.\n1. Bitcoin value increases over time by design\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s transactional volume increasing worldwide every day, a cap on production in the future, and a reduction in Bitcoins produced every 10 minutes just implemented July 10th, Bitcoin values will continue to climb for the foreseeable future.\nU.S. Dollars and pretty much any fiat (paper) currency you can think of are losing value every year due to inflation, which is the increase of supply of said currency. Bitcoin is deflationary, by design. Bitcoin supply falls from now on, in four-year increments known as Bitcoin \u201chalvings,\u201d reducing the number of Bitcoins produced every ten minutes. Right now, this is 12.5 BTC per block.\nA dollar has no production limit on the amount it can be inflated by decree of government or the centralized banking syndicate. Paper currency is generally inflated to try to outspend debts, or pay for unholy wars. So no debt, no inflation, and no blood on Bitcoin\u2019s hands. I\u2019d say we\u2019re off to a good ideological start\u2026..\n2.\u00a0Fiat currency fatigue\nWith global access to the Internet, and so many recent economic collapses of paper currency (Greece, Cyprus, Venezuela, Argentina, Zimbabwe, and more on the horizon), there is more interest than ever in a flat-out better economic system that is not so prone to failure after failure.\nMexico and Ecuador have been in discussions to mimic the Bitcoin blockchain and create their own digital currencies. China has had these discussions with Citibank and Deloitte to do the same. Tunisia, a North African nation, has already started its own national economic blockchain, and Japan has accepted Bitcoin as a national currency, on par with the Yen itself.\n3.\u00a0Wall Street/Big Business hasn\u2019t jumped onto the Bitcoin bandwagon\u2026..yet\nBlockchain technology has been the darling of Wall Street, not Bitcoin. This is not without some good reason. Bitcoin has been embroiled in scandals and regulatory purgatory in many global locales, so it can be seen as a financial wild card to place big bets with.\nPayPal has caressed the exterior of the Bitcoin concept, but it still is not a part of their core business. Microsoft and Dell are the other major players, but until a mass adoption event happens, or is forced to happen by some greater economic meltdown, Bitcoin will be seen as an outlier, not the best bet.\n4.\u00a0Cash is leaving the scene and will be replaced by digital payments anyway", "birthday": "2016-07-24T10:20:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-24 09:20:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 24}

If he had invested that money in cryptocurrency, the world would be a much better place.\nSanders\u2019 campaign contributed to Google, Facebook and Verizon\nBernie Sanders, US presidential candidate for the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination and favorite of the poor and equality-centered, failed to defeat his rival Hillary Clinton, long painted as the Wall Street candidate.\nHowever, during the course of his campaign Sanders did amass a large sum in excess of $200 million, mostly from small donors seeking a more economically-just society.\nHowever, effort may have had the opposite effect intended. As it is, the vast majority of funds raised by Sanders ended up being spent by the campaign, for operating costs such as food, travel, lodging, and advertisements.

At a total market cap of around $13 billion, with a record high of just under $16 billion, a number in the hundreds of millions could send significant ripples through the cryptocurrency world.\nThe funds accrued by the Sanders campaign could have bought the entire supply of all cryptocurrencies excluding the top 25, or entirely bought out any cryptocurrency not including the top four (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Steem, and Ripple).

Late last week, the Ethereum project forked their blockchain in order to undo the damage caused by the DAO fiasco. \u00a0While the fork was supposedly based on a consensus of miners, devs, users, service-providers, and investors, we see that this is not the case considering we now have two Ether chains running at the same time, Ethereum HF (the new and currently longer chain) and Ethereum Classic which is the old, unadulterated chain.\u00a0This fascinating development is very revealing for the field of crypto-economics, and is a relevant cautionary tale for those parties that have been pushing for a bitcoin hard fork for past few years.\nRegardless of how the Ethereum drama plays out as the new and old chains compete with one another for hashing power and investment capital (Ether Classic is now a separate coin that can be traded on exchanges such as Poloniex), all bitcoin can do is watch and learn.\u00a0If nothing else, this controversy has highlighted that the crypto \u201creserve currency\u201d status that bitcoin holds is both warranted and valuable, and sets the stage for the upside resolution we have been looking for, albeit we may be waiting for another month or two for the breakout.\nSo, with all of that in mind let\u2019s take a look at the daily chart once again to see how the consolidation is playing out.

However, while gold was seen as the natural hedging instrument when financial markets become unstable and increasingly risky, more people are now turning their attention to alternative ways of saving money.\nHe said:\n \u201cAfter almost a decade of unconventional monetary policy, investors have started considering the alternatives for endless quantitative easing, negative interest rates, [and] currency devaluations. In this environment, and in comparison to the precious metal, Bitcoin appears more and more as an even stronger contender to serve as a hedge, a safe haven asset.\u201d \nCalculating the trade volumes at the beginning of 2016 until the end of June, the total value of gold for the beginning six months of the year amounted to around $44 million compared to Bitcoin\u2019s $47 million in the same period.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to see that the digital currency is experiencing a strong growth in Brazil. This is evident when you look at reports from\u00a0bitValor stating that during the month of June 2016, the total Bitcoin trade volume rose by more than 45 percent compared to the trade volumes in 2015. Additionally, during the first six months of 2016, the total value of Bitcoin trades has exceeded that of combined Bitcoin trade volumes from the past three years.\nUlrich says:\n \u201cThe cryptocurrency is not just digital gold, it\u2019s digital gold on steroids. Compared to the shiny and tangible asset, Bitcoin provides an enormous reduction in transaction costs. It\u2019s incredibly easier and cheaper to hold, store, and transfer, and it can be sent to anyone anywhere in the world in any amount.\u201d \nUlrich added that as time goes by, more investors will inevitably realize the obvious utility of such an asset. Once they grasp the advantages over gold, it will be difficult not to expect Bitcoin to keep rising and surpassing the old safe haven metal. While it may take some time for Bitcoin to reach new highs, around six to 12 months according to Ulrich, he expects that during this time, the blocksize limit will be resolved, which in turn will give reluctant investors another boost of confidence.\nBrazilian Banks Test Out Blockchain", "birthday": "2016-07-19T15:10:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-19 14:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 19}

In that game, there is a zone called Netherstorm with several \u00a0references to\u00a0\"Ethereum\". You can see this reflected on Google Trends, where a search for Ethereum shows a bump around 2007. By comparison, today's search volume for Ethereum the blockchain technology easily outpaces the temporary game curiosity.\nCT: What do you think of the hard forking solution to The DAO incident. Are we more secure today?\nTG:\u00a0For me, the primary concern for blockchains should be \"does this help us achieve a greater audience\"?\nMarketing, branding, and community sentiment play into this more than most technologists would like to admit, but at the end of the day, we have to attract eyeballs and mindshare to push blockchains into global consciousness.\nAlthough there's a a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem with adoption and scaling of blockchains, multiple goals can be sought in parallel, since longer-term scaling research will ultimately help get us where we need to be.\nBecause the Ethereum community has generally been handling issues with aplomb, I'm cautiously optimistic that the end result will be a more resilient network both in technology and preparedness.\n\nCT: How you got involved in Ethereum?\nTG:\u00a0I was on sabbatical in 2012 after having worked for some large corporate enterprises. I was in search of something different to work on and in that time, I re-discovered Bitcoin as a means for tipping over the internet.\nIt didn't take long for me to jump down the rabbit hole, and in that process I met Wendell Davis, founder of Hive wallet. While working on early attempts at Dapps for that project, he encouraged me to attend the Darkwallet event taking place in Milan.\nIt was there that I met Amir Taaki, Peter Todd, Mihai Alisie, and many others in the Bitcoin space. Several of the ideas discussed there revolved around making crypto easier to use, but were ultimately limited by available protocols. It was here that I heard the first rumblings of some new idea that would solve a lot of problems from some Russian kid that wrote for Bitcoin Magazine.\nAfter returning home to Chicago, I stayed in touch with Mihai who eventually connected me with Vitalik Buterin to assist on the Ethereum website.\nCT: Ethereum and smart contracts: Do you feel that in the real world it would be difficult to understand for lay people?\nTG: I believe a large part of the misunderstanding with so-called smart contracts is that the name is partially a misnomer. Really what we're talking about is programs on blockchains. These programs can be coded to do just about anything, but have the added benefit of digital uniqueness without central point of failure. From this point, lots of things are possible from digital assets to autonomous assistants.\nCT: You have talked about micropayments as a useful application for cryptocurrencies.

Making sound decisions is thus important: it is based on good decisions that we can expect good outcomes.\nCollectively the markets can play the role of an oracle as well. What if we could devise a system which would use the collective wisdom of the markets to help form better policy or devise effective governance models that could actually deliver.\nCan we come up with a system that would allow poor countries to make better decisions for their upliftment or help people perceive how their future might unfold? What if it was possible to create an entire prediction market? Ethereum offers a unique opportunity to do just that.\nA prediction market to gauge the future\nGnosis is based on Ethereum and aims to offer a prediction market as a service. Their aim is to enable people to figure out what is going to happen in the future. They want to act as an oracle and will allow users to create events and fund them as either single investors or as a crowdfunded campaign for this purpose.\nCointelegraph talked with Matt Liston who is a Startgeist at Gnosis about how Gnosis works and he says:\n \u201cGnosis enables anyone, anywhere, to speculate on the outcome of events with financial incentive. It is an indispensable tool to create more efficient information economies. Applications of Gnosis are incredibly wide ranging, from more flexible and efficient sports betting and financial instruments, to novel forms of governance, insurance, action incentivization, information aggregation, and much more! The Gnosis platform will enable anyone to create new applications very easily. Our goal is to make this process as simple as setting up a new Facebook page. Gnosis will serve as a toolset and shared liquidity pool for the next generation of markets.\u201d \nShaping policy with markets\nThe prediction markets can provide useful data that can be used to create a governance model termed as \u2018Futarchy\u201d. This can be useful to reshape policy for a wide array of topics.\nOne example can be the plans of Gnosis to reshape their own Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO). Gnosis plans to create a platform level DAO that will allow anyone to suggest to veto a funding proposal that has been created by the core team.\nAfter a veto opens it will trigger a futarchy mechanism that creates two types of Gnosis tokens Matt Liston explains:\n \u201cOne token (A) has a value of one Gnosis token if the proposal passes, and the other (B) has that value if the proposal does not pass. These tokens will be tradable on a market. Those participants who believe the proposal is not in the best interest of Gnosis should sell token A and keep token B. Conversely, those who support the proposal should sell token B and keep token A. In this way, the exchange rate between these tokens represents the demand for a proposal to pass or not pass. After a certain amount of time the decision is made corresponding to the token with higher value.\u201d \nCan the market decide everything?\nAlthough markets are known to be capable of factoring in future events to a certain degree and take them into account, it is a well known fact that socio-political or sudden economic upheavals can cause markets to behave erratically. While this is true of regular economic markets, it is also true of a prediction only model.\nWe asked Matt Liston about what he thinks markets or voters will not be able to foresee. We also asked him about potential issues that may be caused under this system.\nHe was of the view that the two categories of events that cannot be accurately forecasted by the prediction markets are those, which involve some form of existential threat and those that can\u2019t be easily decided.\nHe offered examples like \u201cWill an asteroid wipe out humanity\u201d and \u201cDoes God exist?\u201d for both of these classes of problems. The reason why existential problems can\u2019t be easily decided are because they threaten the very continuity of the markets and thus there is no incentive to make a prediction.\nAs for those events that can\u2019t be easily decided, the predictions are not likely to be accurately resolved according to Matt. Problem areas that may affect the prediction markets are lack of volume and lack of experts that provide unique knowledge.\nHowever, Gnosis believes that such problems are likely to be \u2018negligible\u2019 as they think that if the proposal is contentious enough that it would attract \u2018enough\u2019 participation.\nNeed for experimentation\nOne of the issues with DAO has been the lack of good old-fashioned lab testing. Gnosis told us that they are not convinced that the participation and consensus requirements for funding projects in the DAO was sufficient.\nThis rings true considering traditional funds require a far more stringent agreement before they would finance a project. It is also true that traditional funds usually have onboard paid experts.\nGnosis though are excited about future possibilities related to DAO governance, they say:\n \u201cWe have received a generous Ethereum Dev grant which will be used to test some of the cryptoeconomic assumptions for Futarchy, particularly how easy it will be for actors to manipulate market values when incentive is provided. We hope that this, and tools which we will create, will form a foundation for future DAO governance work.\u201d \nThe DAO fork may open a can of worms\nAlthough Gnosis themselves have not made any hard predictions on the coming hard fork in Ethereum after the DAO incident, we did ask them what they thought about it.", "birthday": "2016-07-20T13:40:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-20 12:40:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 20}

Let\u2019s take a closer look at the Bank of England proposals.\nCentral bank issued digital currencies\nUsing a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model calibrated to match the pre-crisis United States, the Staff Working Paper No. 605: The macroeconomics of central bank issued digital currencies finds that issuing a CBDC of 30% of GDP, against government bonds, could permanently raise GDP by as much as 3%, due to reductions in real interest rates, distortionary taxes, and monetary transaction costs.\nIssued on Monday July 18, the paper by John Barrdear and Michael Kumhof studied the macroeconomic consequences of a central bank granting universal, electronic, 24x7, national-currency-denominated and interest-bearing access to its balance sheet via the issuance of a CBDC.\nThe paper says:\n\u201cOur analysis suggests that the only conditions needed to secure these gains are that a sufficiently large stock of CBDC is issued in steady state, and that the issuance mechanism for CBDC ensures that the central bank only trades CBDC against government debt instruments.\u201d\nStructural issues\nA broader and qualitative analysis of the pros and cons of a CBDC regime by the researchers distinguished between structural issues, price and output stability issues and financial stability issues.\nIn the structural issues, they looked at risk and the level of interest rates; CBDC stock issuance arrangements, balance sheets, and real economic outcomes; CBDC flow issuance arrangements, fiscal policy, and real economic outcomes; reduced cost of providing transaction services; competition in payment services; competition in accounts services; final settlement and collateral; and time of operation.\nIn summary, they concluded on the basis of the preliminary discussion that it seems safe to assume that the implementation of a CBDC system would be a net positive for the steady-state economy, through the alleviation of a number of frictions.\nPrice and output stability issues\nThey looked at a second policy instrument. The zero lower bound on nominal policy interest rates; increasing interdependence of monetary and fiscal policies; and more and more timely, data under price and output stability issues.\nThe researchers, again, say it seems safe to assume that the implementation of a CBDC system would be a net positive for price and output stability, through the availability of a second monetary policy instrument that complements the policy rate.\nFinancial stability issues\nIn the financial stability issues, \u00a0they looked at transition risks; the risk of a run from bank deposits to CBDC; the potential partial removal of Too Big To Fail concerns; the resiliency of the payment system; and the provision of more data on interconnectedness, and", "birthday": "2016-07-21T11:05:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-21 10:05:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 21}

The IOTA protocol runs off of Tangle, which has similar functionality to a blockchain yet acts more like an emulated version, giving it more versatility.\nCointelegraph catches up with David S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8, the co-founder of IOTA, who had earlier talked to us about the technology involved in the token during the BETA launch.\nCT: When is the full launch happening?\nDavid S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8: In IOTA there is no specific date that can be called 'full launch'. IOTA is currently in the very beginning of the first of 3 launch stages which began on July 11th after 6 months of alpha/beta testing. We're currently at the beginning of Stage 1, so live-net went live on July 11th, but the actual 'launch' will take place over the following weeks, as there are so many different aspects that can't be released all in one day.\nCT: Can you describe the three stages in brief for our readers?\nDS: Stage 1 is primarily about main net launch, i.e. going live as an immutable ledger. Other community issues like user-friendly GUI, website, forum, chat, listing on exchanges and other immediate issues are also part of this first stage. There are also partnerships and proof of concepts with large companies (like Microsoft) that we have been working on since fall 2015. This \u2018Stage 1\u2019 will continue in the coming weeks and months.\nStage 2 will be all about extending the utility of IOTA, whose core is \u2018transactions and data-transfer\u2019. In Stage 2 we will, together with other partners using IOTA, release modules that go Beyond transactions and data-transfer.\nIn Stage 3, the hardware implementation come in. Any device that has this will be able to process thousands of transactions per second. The Company that initiated the IOTA Project is working on precisely such an IoT processor.\nCT: What has changed in the BETA version, compared to the initial idea that you began with?\nDS: The core idea has remained the same, but the software has been optimized a lot and is still being optimized. At the moment it's all about making it as fast as possible in terms of transactions per minute on average.\nCommunity reception\nCT: How has the reception from the cryptocurrency community been so far, as the first block-less cryptographic token?\nDS: So far the reception has been tremendous in the vast majority of cases. Given the huge focus on issues like Block size debate and prohibitive fees of blockchains in the past 2 years, people are very excited that there exist now a technology that resolves these issues, while making the decentralization even stronger.\nThere are always be some biased people with a rather parochial view of the blockchain space that treat every new technology as a 'threat' to their preferred/invested solution, but those people are hardly even worth acknowledging.\nCT: I know you have talked about it before, but, now that you are right there, would you like to elaborate further, on how IOTA will be a better option than the ones currently available, and in what ways?\nDS: The best way to really grasp how IOTA is such a leap forward is by comparing it to the traditional blockchain. In regular blockchains, you outsource the verification of the network, essentially decoupling the verification of the network from the users of said network, this is why you have to pay miners/stakers a fee to verify your transactions. In IOTA there is no such decoupling, instead it is an entirely self-sustaining network where the users verify transactions of other users. This means there is no compensation needed and thus no fee.\nPre-IOTA there was no way to do true micro-transactions, that is transactions that may be 0.1 cent or 10 cents, because of this prohibitive fee you pay to verify the transactions. You can imagine in Internet-of-Things where the machines are the prosumer and consumers. A sensor might be purchasing 5 cents worth of electricity from a solar grid, now imagine that the sensor also had to pay a 10 cent fee on top of this 5 cent purchase, it's just not feasible at all. In IOTA you can indeed do this, you can pay whatever tiny amount you want without having to worry about any fee at all.", "birthday": "2016-07-20T14:30:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-20 13:30:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 20}

At the end of the day, PSD2 is prompting EU banks into a technological wave of APIs that is happening anyway through natural market forces\u201d. \nSo, what does PSD2 actually mean for the world of finance?\nPSD2 and European Open Banking\nThe financial industry in any country is a rather complicated one. It is developing so rapidly with innovative solutions introduced at truly incredible pace.\nThe EU has created a complex financial ecosystem with the European Commission, the European Banking Authority, the European Payments Council, with which all financial institutions must comply.\nWhile many countries still struggle to create a regulatory framework supporting innovation in banking, the UK and other members of the European Union family advanced significantly towards establishment of open banking.\nThe key step in this campaign is the introduction of EU\u2019s Revised Payments Service Directive (PSD2) aimed at creating a more integrated European payments market.\nThe PSD2 extends the scope of the original Payment Service Directive launched in 2007. It requires all banks operating within the EU to provide access to customer account information, transaction information and payment initiation to third parties through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).\nJust business, no politics\nFor years, the UK has been titled as the fintech capital of the world. Thus, in 2015, the UK Fintech sector generated \u00a36.6 b in revenue, and attracted \u00a3524m in investment, employing a Fintech workforce of 61,000.\nWorld\u2019s leading Fintech policy environment, which stems from supportive regulatory initiatives, tax incentives, and government programs, gave the UK a significant competitive advantage.\nThe UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU family not only raised many doubts about London\u2019s continued reign as the global leader in fintech innovation, talent and investment, but also certain concerns about country\u2019s continued regulatory alignment.\nCertainly, it has shaken the ground a little bit, and a huge amount of work and renegotiations for the UK payment industry is there to follow. But as the main driver for PSD2 is technological and not political, the UK decision to leave the EU will hardly have any significant effect on the implementation of the directive.\nThe main purposes of PSD2 is to catch up with the technological innovations in the financial industry and spur its development within Europe. Both of these factors are of a major importance for the UK, whether it is a member of the EU or not.\nOptions to chose from\nObviously, the UK would no longer be obliged to follow PSD2, or any other EU legislation, with banks offered a freedom to reassess their strategy for responding to PSD2.\nBasically, they can choose between doing the minimum to meet the regulation while doing business as usual, or they can dive in completely to use APIs as drivers of growth.\nGoing with the flow and doing exactly what the Directive requires and nothing more is safe, however not without some challenges.\nOnce the locks around bank\u2019s \u201ccrown jewels\u201d have been cut, a dozen of third parties will attack them sooner than they can come up with use cases and value propositions for their own customers.\nOn the contrary, taking maximum out of PSD2 would mean adding value-added functionality to the APIs for which the bank can charge a fee. In addition, it could mean a major departure from how banks have operated in the past.\nThus, in order to maintain a direct connection with customers, there is a possibility for banks to become payment initiators and data brokers for retailers, in other words providing a route to the market, rather than being a target.\nA chance to show\u2019em all\nBrexit has initiated a race between many cities to become the global hub for digital financial services platforms.\nHowever, UK policy makers clearly showed that they do not intend on losing in this race, if there is even any chance for London losing its crown as the capital of fintech.\nMoreover, they see the country leading the way on open APIs banking, realizing it is an opportunity to stimulate innovation and gain competitive advantage.", "birthday": "2016-07-21T13:20:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-21 12:20:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 21}

Despite not being reported by any major cryptocurrency news outlets, it has managed to secure an impressive $1.11 million in its ICO, which was closed less than two weeks ago. \nBased on that success, the team behind Rise plans to develop a highly secure and the most user-friendly decentralized application platform. \nAccording to their White Paper, Rise is to hire a dedicated vulnerability analyst, and work continuously with Node Security Project (the app\u2019s backend is developed using Node.js) among just a few of the measures in place to ensure as high security as possible. \nA tool for everyone \nHowever, the main advantage of the new platform arguably lies elsewhere: it\u2019s going to have a simple drag and drop GUI for the development of its DAPPs. That allows basically anyone to create their own decentralized application, as opposed to, for example, Ethereum, which requires the developers to know its internal programming language, Solidity. \n       \n- Rise Introductory Video \nThat accessibility does not come at the expense of some of the more demanding users, however: Rise will still provide an opportunity to code DAPPs directly in many programming languages - in fact, any language that can run on Linux and consume APIs is available. \nIn an industry heavily oriented towards professional software engineers and cryptocurrency geeks, Rise wants to represent an opportunity for people from many other walks of life to participate in an overarching trend of decentralization, which seems to be upon us. \nCointelegraph has contacted the Lead Developer of Rise, Justin Donnaruma, in order to ask him about the project: \nCointelegraph: What are the Rise\u2019s team\u2019s prior experiences? Have any of you participated in major cryptocurrency projects before? \nJustin Donnaruma: Steven Remington and myself built a small mining company back in 2013. We did pretty well, right up until the big collapse. Even sold a couple of miners. That was my only major project in cryptocurrency, though building a dashboard for the minors was quite the challenge. \nOutside of that, I have worked in two major capacities. I was Director of Cyber Intelligence Operations for SIROAL International for approximately 3 years. That entailed everything from open source intelligence gathering, using custom built tools, to vulnerability analysis and exploit development, even Red-team operations for clients. \nMost recently, I was the lead developer of the Tools and Technology team at Carbonite, Inc. That entailed designing system architecture for new tools that needed to be built, scoping work items for time / size estimates, and developing the solutions. There were a few I developed before starting to build a team there, specifically the Knowledge base. That is a public site that handles a significant portion of Carbonite\u2019s client traffic in a month. After another couple developers were brought on board, we built a bunch of internal tools, including some complex Quality Assurance tooling for managing Technical Support agent performance across phone, email, and chat. \nSteve\u2019s experience is more in networking and affiliate marketing where he has worked with many companies - including a multi-million dollar golf simulation company - to generate sales by offering incentive type programs. \nCT: Do you expect to have to make compromises, in order to achieve the high degree of security that is promised in your White Paper? \nJD:\u00a0I do expect to make some compromises. That is nearly always the case with security systems. The APIs we have right now are somewhat limited, and that will likely not change. We are still architecting how the hosting platform will function, and we will likely have some more announcements on that front in the coming weeks.

We can\u2019t say enough about Shawn and Fabian and we\u2019re looking forward to collaborating with other projects.\u201d \nThis partnership between Counterparty and Storj will be highly visible given Storj\u2019s partnership with Microsoft\u2019s Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) earlier this year.\nIn a recent\u00a0Storj blog post companies such as Coca-Cola, Cox Enterprises, The Weather Channel, and Capgemini, are noticing the impact of distributed object storage and are exploring the benefits that Storj can produce in their businesses.\nIn the blog post, Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin said:\n \u201cDistributed file storage systems like Storj have the potential to eliminate high mark-up costs and market inefficiencies, and provide a much higher level of privacy, reliability, and quality of service than we see today.\u201d \nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Trevor Altpeter, director of the Counterparty Foundation summed it up by saying that \u201cit was a great match for both parties and the Counterparty community at large.\u201d\nUnidirectional and bidirectional micropayments and the Lightning Network\nPreviously, each Counterparty transaction was undertaken through the Bitcoin blockchain. However, while this was a secure process each transaction was impacted by Bitcoin\u2019s ten-minute block times and high transaction fees.\nAccording to Counterparty, payment channels allow two users of Bitcoin to pay between them in a process time that is much quicker than Bitcoin\u2019s 10-minute block times.\nYoung explained to Cointelegraph that discussions are circulating regarding what will happen to Bitcoin\u2019s utility for small transactions as the block reward continues to decrease and the price per transaction increases.\nYoung notes:\n \u201cPayment channels and the Lightning Network are helping to solve that problem by allowing a number of transactions to be bundled together and paying a much smaller fee per transaction.

These assets come in form of BitCrystals (BCY) and act as the premium in-game currency to purchase items and are assets that can be traded freely on the blockchain, outside of the game.\nAdditional features to come after test-running\nCurrently in beta, SoG has been operating under testing seasons, currently in the sixth iteration, with players rewarded with BCY for in-game achievements, essentially points gathered for the leaderboard.\nWhen the game is launched in full, it will continue operating in this manner, with additional features like level creation and guilds, according to game designer Jasper Damman.\nHowever, seasons will run much longer, for about half of the year, and while it will still be leaderboard-based, the game will operate with a key pivot: the cards in-game will change with each new season.\nIn other words, there will be a new lot to take their place tantamount to what occurs in physical card games and collections, explained Shaame, increasing value of older editions or collections given the heightened rarity of the items.\n\u201cRight now we have pure blockchain cards.

Everyone is finding an application or two of the technology behind Bitcoin and trying to solve any number of problems using the open ledger technology. While innovation and creativity aren\u2019t necessarily bad things, too much of a good thing can lead to problems.\nA lot of people are playing with Blockchain at the moment which includes security companies, large banks, governments, private individuals, stock exchanges and others. All of these people realise that Blockchain\u2019s ability to handle transactions without a central framework is important for the future.\nThe problem though may lie in areas where there is a free for all.\nAn identity crisis\nA digitally verifiable identity document is the solution to many of the world\u2019s problems according to the proponents. They claim that having a unique identity document can help narrow down people who are in needs of benefits and enable them to access a system where their needs can be met.\nIn India the government is currently implementing an ID programme called \u2018Aadhar\u2019 which loosely translates into English as basis. This programme, while successful, has raised concerns over privacy and security of the data that the government has collected.\nPersonally I have avoided getting a government issued biometric identity managed by a central Identification Authority as is the case with Aadhar, because I have real world concerns about this data being lost or falling into the \u2018wrong hands\u2019.\nThere is an alternative way of creating digitally verified identification documents as well, and that involves using the Blockchain. In its sustainable development agenda, the United Nations say that they would like to provide legal identity for all including birth registration by 2030. \u00a0\nThe UN is considering a Blockchain approach and has met with industry people in this regard. However this push for the need for everyone to have an identity is also a concern for those of us that would like freedom from a future where we are forced to prove who we are at the drop of a hat by the powers that be.\nHowever, at the moment the positives seem to outweigh the negatives. Alex Matanovic, CEO of EC District, says in response to a question whether digital identity will be based on a Blockchain run solution:\n \u201cI definitely think that is going to happen, sooner or later. I still have no idea how it is going to look like, but I am looking forward to it. I am sure that type of solution will solve many problems we have now, but also create some new problems that we will be tackling in years to come.\u201d \nThe Internet of things\nIt has already begun, our devices are talking with each other. Fridges and Toasters talking with each other for the betterment of humanity or at least that is the idea.\nHowever the question at the centre of this development is who controls the flow of data and who has access to all the information that is generated.\nThere are valid concerns about the misuse of such data by a central authority. A Blockchain of things could indeed help decentralise this information but then again the problems surrounding the openness of this data creep into the equation.\nThe truth is that while the bitcoin Blockchain has existed now for a while, there are valid concerns about how safe and secure it would be when exported to a universal Blockchain of things.\nWhen we talk about the internet of things we are talking about an unknown realm. Will this Blockchain be open to theft, hacking or a possible failure? The answer to this is unknown at the moment.\nA complete shift to cryptocurrency\nMany central banks are now experimenting with Blockchain technology. We have already covered the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s interest in Blockchain as well as the Dutch Central Bank\u2019s efforts in this direction.\nIn a future where all the money is cryptocurrency and all of which is based on Blockchain technology, certain risks will present themselves.", "birthday": "2016-07-13T14:50:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-13 13:50:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 13}

Aside Coinbase finding its way into the Japanese market in an historic partnership move with one of the country\u2019s largest banks, a first of its kind since the Mt Gox experience in 2013,\u00a0higher 24 hour trading volume\u00a0has been recorded in Japan with Bitflyer\u00a0topping the chart according to coinmarketcap.com leaving Bitfinex and others behind.\nIn South America, the launch of Colbitex in Colombia and the rising inflation crisis in Venezuela, as well as the growing use of the currency in Brazil, according to coin.dance are some of the factors that created the necessary awareness for Bitcoin in the region.\nThe Swiss Vontobel effect\nThe introduction of the Vontobel\u00a0certificate on Bitcoin in USD as a classic tracker certificate (SSPA: 1300) that offers investors a simple means of investing in Bitcoin come July 15 is likely to push the price up.\nThe established Swiss bank is giving investors who expect a positive development in the Bitcoin price the opportunity to trade transparently on the SIX Swiss Exchange for the first time, trading the Vontobel certificate on the secondary market i.e. buying or selling at the applicable bid/offer prices. This will be an historic addition to the Bitcoin community especially considering the bank\u2019s 22 international locations and its record as one of the best at identifying and analyzing trends, and subsequently creating innovative investment strategies and products around them.\nItaly/EU zone\u2019s financial status \u00a0\nUnless something drastic is done, a pending crisis in the EU\u2019s financial sector will see Bitcoin\u2019s adoption surge in no time. The\u00a0International Monetary Fund said economic growth in Italy, the eurozone's third-largest economy, wasn't expected to return to the levels seen before the 2008 financial crisis until the mid-2020s when other economies in the euro currency area would have grown 20 percent to 25 percent larger.\nIn its Italy report released on Tuesday, it cut its growth estimate for the country, expecting GDP to expand by less than one percent in 2016 from an earlier forecast of 1.1 percent.\u00a0The IMF urged Italy to launch urgently needed economic reforms to accelerate growth and head off a looming crisis in its financial industry as \"risks tilted to the downside\" including financial market volatility, the refugee surge, and headwinds from the slowdown in global trade.\nFigures suggest a remarkable 17% of bank loans in Italy are bad \u2013 that\u2019s over \u00a3300bn of bad credit hence the recent market volatility \u2013 triggered by the UK referendum decision \u2013 has hit European banks hard and Italian banks harder. Italy and Portugal have not recovered from the 2010-12 European debt crisis, while Greece remains in a perilous situation.\nLast Thursday, Italian Prime Minister admitted that the core risk for Europe is not just the Italian banking sector but the biggest bank of all in Europe: Deutsche Bank.\u00a0\n\"If this non-performing loan problem is worth one, the question of derivatives at other banks, at big banks, is worth one hundred.

However, Blockchain is fast expanding beyond Bitcoin with banks, financial institutions, and individuals slowly understanding the benefits that it can produce.\nNot only that, but with more people finding it easier to invest in the digital currency with financial institutions such as American Express, Nasdaq, and Visa investing in blockchain startups, the world surrounding blockchain is experiencing an attitude change.\n1. Adyen\nAmsterdam-based, Adyen is a leading e-commerce payments company globally across six continents for companies such as Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, Netflix, and Spotify.\nAt the beginning of 2016, the Bitcoin-accepting company announced that they had doubled its annual revenue in 2015 and were, subsequently, expanding its next generation point of sale solutions to the U.S. market.\nIn 2015 Adyen\u2019s yearly transaction volume reached $50 billion while its revenue surged, amounting to $350 million in the same year.\n2.

Since then, they have done the first ever marriage, world citizenship, birth certificate, land titles, issued refugees IDs, public notary in partnership with Estonia and a constitution on the blockchain.\n\nTempelhof says:\n \u201cNow, the idea has a worldwide following, a community of thousands of citizens and activists, embassies, partners and allies on all continents, extensive mainstream media coverage, and is being replicated by others.\u201d \nFor Bitnation, however, the real test will be to gain significant market adoption for the Pangea software.

That's what we are doing differently, remove the learning, make apps so easy that people can use them without a manual. And when they use the apps they notice the benefits of blockchain instead of just hearing about it. Our apps have to be better than current banking apps, otherwise regular people wouldn't even give it a chance.\u201d \n\nDerrick J. Freeman, Bitcoin advocate and early adopter, also believes that emphasizing ease of use is imperative to promoting Bitcoin.\n \u201cI tell them all they need to use Bitcoin is an app. Here in New Hampshire, where I live, I can point to a half dozen Bitcoin vending machines that convert fiat and to Bitcoin. No questions asked. That kind of financial freedom and privacy is empowering.\u201d \nWillie Fleming, director of the Scotcoin Project an organization meant to bring cryptocurrency into circulation amongst the Scottish people, has sought out atypical cryptocurrency users in an attempt to spur adoption amongst the general populace.\n \u201cWe have actively gone out and searched for suppliers outwith the normal geek spectrum. So already you can buy beer, get a hotel room, your car serviced, your chimney swept for Scotcoin. Add in T-shirt printing, office/hot desk rental, car hire, football and pro basketball tickets, web design and hosting, server colo and coming soon also flights to/from Glasgow Prestwick. Start-up loans in Scotcoin are now available for young companies who agree to accept Scotcoin for their goods and services.

People had access to the platform, a full desktop, and office. At this stage they had 27,000 daily active users; so they know it works and scales and I believe this has a big part to play in the confidence they have in going forward to the next level. This time around their focus is on smart contracts, a safe public blockchain free for business or personal use.\nThey say they are a Blockchain firm who build banking use-cases and claim to have over 30 proven built banking use-cases for Blockchain projects delivered through the financial industry, targeting specific pain points.\n\nThe company are building these for \u201csigned\u201d banking clients around the world.\nRazormind\u2019s CEO Jawad Yaqub shared with Cointelegraph the details of the crowdsale.\nCointelegraph: So when does the crowdsale go live Mr Yaqub?\nJawad Yaqub: The crowdsale starts on July 15th, 12:00 PM GMT. The DeOS crowdsale is supervised by the Omni Foundation. They have access to all transactional information, with their executives serving in the role of trustees for the DeOS tokens. Razormind has no access to these funds without their approval. \u00a0We are taking great care to secure and safeguard all funds for this crowdsale.\nCT: How is the money being put to work?\nJY: DeOS money is used to directly fund and maintain the first few generations of the DeOS network. Developing, Deploying, Securing, Testing, Monitoring, Analysing, and Scaling the seed network, the data layers etc. A portion of the cost will go towards developing and releasing the following DeOS Features: Clients for Desktop, Clients for Mobile, Language APIs, Blockchain As A Service, Smart Contracts, Decentralized Storage, Decentralized Computing, Language IDEs and Dockerised Deployment.\n\nIt is estimated there will be 1 major release per month with features from the list above. With the final Decentralized Computing release in beta November and live December. As we progress we will release regular updates on DeOS platform progress and spending. Resource estimates and delivery performance will be visible to the community.\nThis is part of our commitment to transparency. In summary, when you buy \u00d0EOS, you\u2019re getting early, exclusive access to the DeOS platform.

After a large rebound ends, a trend of a similarly large scale usually follows.\nWhen will the altcoin corrections end?\nAs was expected, Ethereum\u2019s price went into a rebound toward the downward movement. In order for the price to continue moving downward, it needs to break through an important long-term level around $10, which is protected by the bulls. The current rebound will show the future trend of Ethereum. After passing the $10 mark, the movement will become a larger scale one.\n\nThere was no fortification above $4.1 for Litecoin. A break through the key level responsible for the structure of the upward trend means that the advantage is split between the bulls and the bears. That means that the current sentiment of Litecoin market is a flat. The choice of future direction will happen inside that flat.\n\nDASHBTC\u2019s price continues the wave of a widening flat. At the moment, the price is near the top limit of this sideway movement. Usually, it\u2019s the bears who show themselves at points like these; if they manage to hold the advantage for some time, the price should reach the bottom limit of the widening flat. If the bulls take the advantage, there will be a fortification and a turn to growth.\n\nThe situation is ambiguous for world currencies. The currencies are moving in different directions, which ultimately creates a dollar flat. The formation of a flat on the dollar market can take a while. Such a situation will not create any sort of defined probability for future altcoin trends.\n\nTechnical levels responsible for trend structures\nThe structure of Ethereum\u2019s price rebound can be used to determine the potential of future movement. The main factor for a powerful impulse is an imbalance between the bears and the bulls. The accumulated volume near a correctional Fibonacci level 61% is a key point for a downward impulse. If that zone is not broken through during an upward rebound, there will be a good chance of a downward impulse, which could provoke a formation of a trend larger than the previous downward movement.\nA break through the 61% level will mean that the advantage is split evenly and Ethereum\u2019s price is inside a flat. In that case, a trend-like movement is unlikely to form during the continuation of the downward dynamic.\n", "birthday": "2016-07-12T09:58:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-12 08:58:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 12}

Bitcoin investing does need the courage of your convictions but the rewards can be unparalleled.\nA glance at Bitcoin rates starting in 2010 will tell us that the currency has been through many ups and downs. While the peak was reached between 2013 and 2014, by 2015 Bitcoin had fallen again to US $200 levels and has been steadily inching its way towards $1000 levels again.\nHowever, even in the short term Bitcoin has been volatile, while on May 24, 2016 Bitcoin prices reached US $775, by June 23, 2016 they had again fallen to US$ 560.

", "content": "This month DinarDirham, a decentralized gold trading platform based in Hong Kong, is launching its own wallet with an in-built exchange supporting not only popular digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ether, but also the company\u2019s own digital assets.\nWhat is DinarDirham\nIn 2015, DinarDirham decided to distance itself from a simple \u2018gold trading platform\u2019 format, and its field of operation has expanded since then.\nAccording to the\u00a0company whitepaper, DinarDirham is \u201ca company attempting to address the problem of volatility and price discovery by using the existing spot gold market as the underlying pricing mechanism for its digital currency\u201d.\nArai Ezzra, CTO and co-founder of DinarDirham, says:\n \u201cIf you have an asset that follows real-time gold price, which can be redeemed or claimed for physical gold and if you combine the benefits of digital currencies with benefits of gold as a store of value, in a transparent way, you get a match made in heaven. This is a cheap way to store, trade and use gold globally. Our unique and innovative trading technology based on blockchain makes this possible.\u201d \nWhy gold and Blockchain?\nStelian Balta, CEO and co-founder of DinarDirham, explained to Cointelegraph why gold and Blockchain should work together.\nBalta says:\n \u201cGold is not practical to deal with in today\u2019s global markets, because it\u2019s really cumbersome. Using blockchain, major problems associated with trading and storing gold are being fixed. Blockchain enables transactions to be highly secure, whilst dealing costs virtually disappear.\u201d \nIsmail Malik, CEO at\u00a0Blockchain Lab, agrees that gold-asset management on-the-blockchain holds great potential in reducing friction and enabling trusted transfer of digital gold tokens, transactions and settlements. He believes that Blockchain as a public distributed ledger technology allows for immutability and transparent accounting of all transactions as a forgery-proof record of transactions is stored on thousands of nodes across the world so that it is practically impossible to manipulate or more importantly fraudulently change ownership records.\nHe says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cMy personal belief is that blockchain tech will usher in a new level of transparency and security which will add significant value to the gold industry whilst increasing the number of participants leveraging gold as an asset.\u201d \nManie Eagar, Founder and CEO at DIGFIN - The Future Of Money, notes that with digital tokens linked to an immutable distributed ledger (the blockchain) offering the capacity to register, store and transfer assets, it was only logical for goldbugs to start looking at the \u2018digitization\u2019 of their assets.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum in gold industry\nDinarDirham\u2019s spectrum of services goes beyond the simple trading and exchange of digital (BTC, ETH) and fiat (USD, EUR) money; in addition to that, every client has an option to invest their money by buying physical gold.\nFresh gold price data is tracked by DinarDirham in real time, which allows the users to make the most conscious and informed investment decisions.\nRight now, most of the company\u2019s solutions are built based on Bitcoin 2.0 and its principal structures - Bitcoin\u2019s Blockchain and Ethereum\u2019s Blockchain.\nBut that list is to be continued: the company is closely considering a further blockchain-based system for further development and is currently being researched by DinarDirham.\nInnovative digital assets\nTwo key developments of DinarDirham are the smart contract system GoldSmartContracts, and DinarCoin - a crypto token and a digital currency, built on top of the Ethereum Blockchain.\nIn addition to all the basic qualities of a digital currency: anonymity, decentralization, open-source availability, and liquidity, DinarCoin has one unique and innovative feature: its value is pegged to and backed by real physical gold, and is comparable to a gold spot contract (XAU).\nThus, being tied to the precious metal, the currency is maximally protected from inflation. Using MT4 trading platform custom-built solutions, DinarDirham is capable of hedging and bridges the liquidity \u201crealtime\u201d on every DinarCoin and GoldSmartContract created.\nWith this technology, indirectly we can make sure each token is pegged at the current world price of gold and recorded on the Ethereum public blockchain in a transparent way and as a proof of purchase.\nStelian Balta says:\n \u201cDinarCoin is not just another digital currency or Altcoin. It's backed by gold price from liquidity providers, bridged automatically to regulated financial institutions and also stored in real vaults around the world. We are building an entire ecosystem around DinarCoin - exchange, DinarCoin ATM, merchant gateway and debit cards to allow our users to use their digital assets anywhere in the world. Also, physical Dinar Gold Coin(4.25 grams) is already available to order in South East Asia. With DinarCoin, our mission is to bring stability and transparency to the financial system, especially in payments and as a medium of storing wealth in a trustworthy way. Using Ethereum blockchain, I think we are on the right path\u201d. \nGold Smart Contract or GSC is another digital asset created and utilized by DinarDirham.\nGSC is a system of smart contracts. Each contract represents the ownership right of a particular customer to a particular physical gold bar stored in vaults around the world (Zurich, London, Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Australia and New York) in partnership with ABX.com as \u201cAssociate Member\u201d to offer physical gold to customers.\nEach contract is issued by the gold supplier after a client conducts a purchase of a certain amount of metal; that contract can consequently be used to collect gold from one of many available vaults. Just as DinarCoin, GSC are registered on public Ethereum blockchain, so that the existence of each contract can be confirmed by looking at those.\nBalta says:\n \u201cI think DinarCoin and Gold Smart Contract are game changers in the industry. We bring an innovative concept to our customers to store or move their wealth easily and secure. Digital assets are backed by real gold liquidity and assets from regulated financial institutions, which have the reliability, inherent value of gold, convenience and security of a digital currency.\u201d ", "birthday": "2016-07-07T13:20:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-07 12:20:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 7}

It\u2019s controversial, implementation of LN requires some trust in Blockstream \u2013 there is no guarantee LN will be decentralized. You can read a very good explanation of LN tech here \u201d\u00a0 \nLN is like a payment network, where everything happens very quickly and scales perfectly, but it does not happen directly as Bitcoin\u2019s Blockchain. And in the moment user would like to \u201cwithdraw \u201c Bitcoin from LN, scaling wouldn\u2019t be this good. The plan is the majority of transactions will happen via LN, this way LN will work perfectly.\u201d\nBlockstream created a problem to provide a solution?\nHarrier will not agree with the statement that the problem was created to provide a solution because Blockstream formalized a potential problem and speeded up its solution through certain ideas and concepts that secure the future of Blockstream's business.\n\u201cNevertheless, the growing daily transaction number has recently become a more apparent problem, which may lead to some organizations not being able to maintain their operation rate without such a solution,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nThe anonymous contributor considers the claim controversial, saying Blockstream looks in the future with views that differ from Satoshi\u2019s.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t say it straightforward, but they do think that Bitcoin shouldn\u2019t be for everyone. They don\u2019t want to create super free, decentralized, open and cheap payment network. Probably because they think it\u2019s not a viable choice for Bitcoin,\u201d the writer stated, adding that increasing blocksize would help Bitcoin at the moment as blocks are full because of huge amount of microtransactions and fees are growing.\nThe contributor claims that Blockstream is doing what would make Bitcoin less appealing to the public.\n \u201cI suppose they could increase blocksize to 2MB, but right now it is the matter of principle.\u00a0Bitcoin with big blocks would be totally different from Bitcoin with small blocks, but with LN and SegWit. First one is mostly for people, the second one is mostly for business.\u00a0Blockstream\u2019s plan has been to make Bitcoin a business. They are succeeding so far, the problem emerged because of Bitcoin popularity and huge community energy and ambition. But it\u2019s only natural that community and \u201cboard of directors\u201d (metaphorically speaking) would want different things.\u201d \nDanger of Bitcoin privatization\nNodeCounter.com noted on its page that the only way for the private company, Blockstream, to be removed as the central authority over a crippled Bitcoin is for miners and pool operators (not users) to adopt a different implementation of Bitcoin, such as Bitcoin Classic as a failure to do so will result in \u201cBlockstream's paid Bitcoin Core Developers to have unfettered control of the Bitcoin system for their own financial gain.\u201d\nHarrier thinks privatization should not be implemented. He said Bitcoin has always been and will continue to be, first of all, a monetary unit.\n \u201cEven Lightning Network uses bitcoins as a collateral.\u00a0Therefore, from my point of view, privatization should not be the case.\u201d \nThe anonymous contributor says what is about to happen is not privatization, citing conspiracy theories, but a change of philosophy. \u201cIt\u2019s basically impossible to privatize Bitcoin \u2013 too many people own Bitcoins, too many history, too many losses if this happens, and most important \u2013 it won\u2019t function properly without its blockchain, which can\u2019t be privatized.\nPrivatization talks are just conspiracy theories. But - Bitcoin could (and probably will) become much more centralized.\nCommunity\u2019s idol is Satoshi Nakamoto, who wanted Bitcoin to be different from what it is now. But Satoshi is not here, he is not participating in Bitcoin development. Part of community feels that his views are outdated (they are even having proposals to update the whitepaper).", "birthday": "2016-07-07T17:15:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-07 16:15:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 7}

Cointelegraph spoke to Si\u00e2n Jones, Founder of European Digital Currency and Blockchain Technology Forum, about the proposal and its possible outcomes.\nAnti-Money Laundering Directive\nAs Si\u00e2n Jones told us, EU officials had been working on the new law since February, talking with virtual currency and prepaid card stakeholders and others, to draft the proposed new directive amending the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive.\nThe primary driver behind the proposals has been to remove anonymity from payments in order to combat terrorist financing, action triggered by the Paris (and later Brussels) attacks. At present, they are just proposals for a new directive.\nHowever, the proposals are very likely to be adopted by the European Council and European Parliament (become law). The directive then has to be harmonised into national legislation in the 28 member states.

However, there should be an appropriate balance to be sure that it's not harmful for innocent people.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-social-platform-steemit-takes-advantage-of-reddits-heavy-censorship", "title": " Blockchain Social Platform Steemit Takes Advantage of Reddit\u2019s Heavy Censorship ", "content": "Since the early days of the internet, there has been a constant movement of people, from mailing boards to Facebook and Reddit. Eternal September keeps chasing out the best who are then followed by the rest with the process now repeating.\nAlthough Facebook is one of the biggest companies on earth, few think it is cool \u2013 your mom is on it. Meanwhile, Reddit, itself a product of an exodus from Digg, has brought to the forefront a serious problem, private sector censorship of free speech.\nThe duo of Daniel Larimer and Ned Scott, the former a techy, the latter from the world of finance, think they have a solution,\u00a0Steemit. The blockchain-powered platform is a mixture between medium and reddit where users are paid for voting and posting in a new currency called steem, currently valued at around $0.23 per unit. Steemit users just received the first payout, $1.3 million in total, but can this really work?\nThe incentives of steemit\u2019s design\nThere has been much debate on the use of money to incentivise intrinsic behaviour, such as studying, donations, or healthy activity. The jury is still out with one\u00a0study concluding that the effects of monetary incentivization on intrinsically motivated behaviour, basically, depends:\n \u201cA considerable and growing body of evidence suggests that the effects of incentives depend on how they are designed, the form in which they are given (especially monetary or nonmonetary), how they interact with intrinsic motivations and social motivations, and what happens after they are withdrawn. Incentives do matter, but in various and sometimes unexpected ways.\u201d \nThe incentives of streemit\u2019s design were described by Larimer, speaking to Cointelegraph In eight points:\n  No transaction fees. Mandatory spending. Liquidity rewards to bootstrap market trading. Everyone who provides value should get a stake. Don't ask for money, ask for time and energy. Build value for people who don't buy in or use the platform (readers). Natural marketing and SEO through producing content. Make it fun.  \nMuch of it is self-descriptive, but we asked for an explanation on \u201cmandatory spending\u201d.\nLarimer says:\n \u201cUnder Steem, it doesn't matter if you vote or not, funds will be distributed to someone. This forces people to focus on directing funds to the best cause, rather than \u200b*if*\u200b they should fund something. The result of mandatory spending is that the platform gradually changes hands from those who do nothing to those who contribute.\u201d \nDistributing the funds\nThe monetary aspects of the platform are somewhat complex. First of all, it all runs and is stored on a blockchain, so it has miners. Second, it uses a mixture of proof of work mining, proof of stake and delegated proof of stake. To make it a bit more fun, it has three currencies.\nThe \u201ccore\u201d currency is Steem, which is highly inflationary with steem units doubling every year. Many, therefore, convert it to Steem Power (SP) which locks the currency in a stake for two years. Then there is Steem Dollars which aims to be pegged to the US Dollar.\nThere is an even more complex method of distributing the funds which constantly inflate. 90% of the inflated funds are given to SP holders, the other 10% is shared:\n \u201cThe accounting is complex, but fundamentally this is no different than Bitcoin. Bitcoin has allocated 10% of its market cap each year to pay for miners. Steem allocates 10% of its market cap to pay for curation (voters), posting, mining, block production, and liquidity.\u201d \nThe 10% is allocated to four groups, \u201c1% block producers, 1% liquidity, 6% authors and 2% curators,\u201d according to Larimer\u2019s estimate. There is no halving, so the currency continues to inflate at 10%, effectively, indefinitely.\n\u201cIt has really gained traction. New users are signing up every day. There is a constantly growing number of active users,\u201d says Larimer with more than 700 active users yesterday and 20,000 pageviews a day.\nReddit\u2019s heavy censorship vs. steem\u2019s censorship resistance\nOne attraction, especially in light of reddit\u2019s heavy censorship by both admins and moderators may be steem\u2019s censorship resistance. As all is stored on a blockchain, unless 51% of node operators, miners and stakeholders agree, no content can be removed. That, of course, has two edges.\nAfter a terrorist shooting in Orlando,\u00a0heavy censorship was implemented by reddit moderators, especially r/news which went so far as to remove a post giving information on blood donations. This brought the bubbling reddit censorship issue to mainstream attention, but only for just a day with no action taken.\nReddit admins have taken a position that moderators can do whatever they wish in their own subreddits. The problem is of course that name domains are hot property as r/news retains a structural advantage over r/news2 due to most newcomers typing the former.\nThat opens our great public spaces where we congregate to insidious overt and covert manipulation which may provide entities with powerful political or financial advantage at, perhaps, the expense of the common good.", "birthday": "2016-07-08T16:59:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-08 15:59:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 8}

Following the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU the race is now on to replace London as the global fintech capital, and Moscow may join the race.\nFocus on Blockchain\nThe \u00a0Party of Growth led by Boris Titov has developed a program which will be presented in the parliament elections this September. Researching and testing Blockchain applications are one of the main priorities for the development of information and financial technology in the country, and are thought to be able to help Russia depart from their dependency on oil and gas.\nTitov says:\n \u201cIt is of no less significance than the creation of the Internet. If today we attract all the main technologies and investors in the sphere of the Blockchain and cryptocurrencies, having all the resources, both geographic and human, we would advance to take our place among the leading countries of the world , not only in this sphere, but in general.\u201d \nThe econmy\u2019s main focus should swing towards development of the \u2018economy of the future,\u2019 which includes information and digital technologies, advanced engineering services, genetics and biotechnologies. The party stands for the \u2018new industrialization\u2019 driving the inflow of high-tech investments to the real economy.\nOpposition to Central Bank\u2019s policy\nTitov is among a few state authorities who openly express their enthusiasm about technology. However, such open-mindedness is not necessarily shared by the majority of his colleagues.\nTitov says:\n \u201cWe are in opposition to the current economic policy adopted by the government and the Central Bank. Unfortunately, so far the President backs them, but we hope it will change soon.\u201d \nInterestingly, the Duma (the Russian parliament) clearly distinguishes Blockchain and cryptocurrency designed on the basis of this technology. While giving some space for playing around with the former, there have been several attempts to ban the latter.\nIn December 2015 the Code of Administrative Offences was updated and included \u00a0a new chapter introducing an administrative responsibility for operations with pseudo money, implying, in this case digital, currencies. Even though the government was recommended to exclude the chapter from the code, it was decided that the draft of the Code would be revised and maybe even passed by the next calling of the Duma.\nThe Ministry of Finance, with the support of Duma, has been sketching tight regulations since 2014. Suggestions by the Ministry included delegation of additional functions to the Central Bank of Russia for combating even the promotion of use of Bitcoins as a means of payment, and imposition of legal responsibility for the operations with Bitcoin.\nRise of fintech at Brexit\u2019s expense\nFollowing the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU the race is now on to replace London as the global fintech capital. What are the chances Russia might take on this role?\nIn April 2016 at the Blockchain and Bitcoin conference which took place in Moscow, representatives of foreign Blockchain companies shared their enthusiasm to contribute to the development of technology in the country.\nPaul Szurek, Head of Strategy&Partnerships at Blockchain said:\n \u201cOur mission is to reinvent finances, make them adequate to the era of the financial technology revolution and provide people with better access to financial services\u201d. \nHe believes that transparent financial technologies will allow fast, secure and confidential transactions, and it is especially important for countries with a low level of trust towards financial institutions, with Russia being one of these countries.", "birthday": "2016-07-02T16:40:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-02 15:40:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 2}

It even allows the setting of an \u2018ex-dividend date\u2019 and a \u2018payment date\u2019, effectively supporting the real-time distribution of stock dividends.\nCointelegraph spoke to Neil Haran, Peerplays Chief Gaming Officer, and Michael P. Maloney, Peerplays Communications Manager, about the creation of the open-source fee sharing module and its importance to Peerplays token holders.\nProfitability issues\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Michael P. Maloney, says that right now the issue of profitability is still an open question with many Blockchain projects since speculation drives much of their value as they struggle to find a niche which will lead to greater mainstream adoption.\nMaloney explains:\n \u201cPeerplays stands out as a unique value proposition, being the first Blockchain which routes many of its fees directly back to core token holders. Since these fees will come from wagering on video game tournaments, sports and casino betting, market trading, and other smart contract activity, we anticipate a healthy stream of revenue will help to underpin the value of the core tokens.\u201d \nIt was only last month that the online gaming platform reported that they were developing a\u00a0Peerplays to Ethereum sidechain by 2017 after receiving feedback from DAO supporters and realizing the significant benefits to Ethereum. This was due to the fact that many other DAO sponsored projects will soon have the chance to utilize the framework Peerplays are developing in order to sidechain their own Blockchains to Ethereum.\nMitigating the Risk of Competition\nDespite the fact that Peerplays have helped change the shape of the Blockchain space with the development of an open-source fee sharing module, the team believe that while it won\u2019t take long for others to catch on to the same ideas that they have, they are of the opinion that Peerplays is designed in a way that incentivizes developers to connect their own server-side games, as well as new games built on sidechains.\nMaloney says:\n \u201cWe are rolling out a framework in the coming months which enables literally any game in the world to be added to the Peerplays network in a way that both the players and game developers can earn money. These things should help to mitigate the effect of competition because Peerplays is essentially programmed to assimilate, rather than destroy.\u201d \nImportant feature to Peerplays token holders\nLast year, online casino gambling took in almost $50 billion in revenue. However, while most major sites are heavily regulated, scandals still occur with millions of dollars lost to fly-by-night outfits and rigged sports betting schemes. Not only that, but anti-sports betting laws in the United States caused an estimated $80 billion to be wagered last year on under-the-table sports betting, with practically no accountability or proof of fairness.", "birthday": "2016-07-02T10:05:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-02 09:05:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 2}

In general, retail businesses keep track of their monthly transactions, and then remit sales taxes due at the end of the month. Using a form of smart contract, perhaps via a Bitcoin payment gateway, sales taxes could be remitted to governments in real time. This provides a direct benefit to government over cash, which is often a massive grey area for off-balance sheet transactions where tax is rarely collected.\u201d \n\nIt all boils down to proper regulation\nAnother expert who spoke to Cointelegraph on the issue is Dmitry Lazarichev, Founder at Wirex.\nLazarichev says that Bitcoin being a conceptually new type of money has significantly changed our mindset.

The feature is already popular in China.\nThis follows the conclusion of its first round of funding, where it received a $2 million investment from Bitmain.\nOTC trading feature added\nIn April, BitKan received $2 million of investment from the Chinese Bitcoin mining hardware company, Bitmain in its A-round of funding, allowing it to launch over-the-counter trading via its app in May.\u00a0Over-the-counter trading differs from exchange trading in that trading is done directly between two parties, without any supervision of an exchange. The company explained to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cBitKan OTC is based on platform-level trade matching. Two types of users exist on\u00a0BitKan - one is the \u2018trader\u2019, the other \u2018general\u2019. A \u2018trader\u2019 can be seen as a fiat-bitcoin exchange while a \u2018general\u2019 as the exchange\u2019s client. The general user is able to use fiat to trade bitcoin and vice versa. When trading, the system will match a general user with an appropriate \u2018trader\u2019; the \u2018trader\u2019 has pre-set trading tactics and waits for the client to knock on his door. BitKan will, according to local laws and regulations, perform KYC checks on the \u2018trader\u2019 as well as the \u2018general\u2019 user. For \u2018brokers\u2019, an extra layer of trader qualification checks do exist to ensure that they provide better service to the \u2018general\u2019 users.\u201d \nHowever, for those concerned about giving away an excess of information through KYC/AML compliance, the company contends that while it will comply with the laws and regulations from relevant jurisdictions, it will simplify the checking procedures and make the process as user-friendly as possible, while also minimizing the obstructions of these checks in small transactions.\nDespite having only be launched less than a month ago,\u00a0BitKan claims its operation data indicates million-USD-level trades being concluded, with daily trading volumes regularly exceeding $1 million.\nSo far the operating data came from the CNY-based market as July 4 is the first day of opening the USD-based trade.\nBitKan says the company\u2019s motivations behind introducing OTC to their app are to allow people to hold and use Bitcoin in a much more convenient fashion.\nOff-chain transactions\nBitKan records all OTC transactions off-chain, meaning sellers need to \u201ccharge\u201d Bitcoin to the \u00a0BitKan platform. \u00a0BitKan founder, Edward Liu, says this is due to capital security concerns:\n \u201cBitKan adopts a 100% reserve funds mechanism.

As it usually happens, a trend is followed by a period of calm, which is then followed by a new trend.\nWill there be a new sharp fall of altcoins?\nEthereum\u2019s price could not fortify at an important level of $16. There was only one option after that kind of development - to continue its downward movement as a correction towards the long-term upward trend. Ethereum\u2019s price has yet again approached the minimal target of the correction. For a more likely downward movement there needs to be a rebound towards the whole downward trend. That rebound will hint at the most probable scenario of a following trend. That way, the continued downward movement (should it happen) will be of a larger scale.\n\nAs was expected, Litecoin\u2019s price underwent a false break through the key level of $4.45. That correction towards the downward trend could grow into a turn. But for a more probable turn the structure of the upward movement has to stay intact. When the structure of any trend breaks, it indicates that there was no support for that movement.\n\nDASHBTC\u2019s price is forming a narrow flat above an important level of 0.0120. Such a flat indicates that the bears are holding the advantage. During the whole rebound the structure of the trend has been staying intact, which gives a chance for the downward movement to continue.\n\nWolrd currencies are undergoing an upward correction after a joint fall. Most currencies have reached their minimal correction targets. That means that soon the market will have to decide again - wether to continue falling or to turn to growth, at least for a wave of flat that will last until the pre-Brexit levels. In case of a formation of flats, the impact on altcoins should be minimal.\n\nTechnical levels for altcoins\nThe movement\u2019s structure determines the amount of potential the future trend has. If the bears manage to hold the advantage, Ethereum\u2019s price will undergo a new sharp fall. But several conditions are needed in order for that scenario to be fulfilled. Firstly, there\u2019s a need for an upward rebound, which will indicate that the long-term upward correction is over, and a larger scale movement has begun. Secondly, the structure of the downward trend has to be preserved. A key level has formed at $14-14.3, near the Fibonacci level and accumulated volume. For a more likely downward impulse, Ethereum\u2019s price has to NOT break that mark. The break through that line will indicate that the bears have stopped being a majority. In that case, a continued flat or the beginning of a formation of a turn to growth will be more likely.\n", "birthday": "2016-07-05T09:30:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-05 08:30:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 5}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/making-netflix-and-youtube-outdated-how-blockchain-changes-media", "title": " Making Netflix and Youtube Outdated: How Blockchain Changes Media ", "content": "Giant online content platforms, such as Netflix and YouTube, currently dominate the content landscape, providing large quantities of easily accessible content for very cheap (or free plus advertisements). However, they remain centralized, meaning that a single entity has ultimate control over content and what compensation (if any) artists receive for their work.\nCointelegraph spoke with Mike Vine, Technology Evangelist for LBRY, about the prospects for a decentralized, blockchain-based, and creator-controlled approach to content dissemination to dismantle the current centralized norm.\nCointelegraph: How exactly does LBRY manage to give content creators full control?\nMike Vine: LBRY is not a service or a store, it's a protocol. It's a way for artists to connect to their fans the same way the internet is a way for you to connect to websites. With LBRY, the rules are encoded and enforced by cryptography \u2013 so we can't just arbitrarily change the terms on anyone down the road. That is very different than, say, Youtube, which is entirely controlled by Google. Google sets the terms of use, the payouts for creators, and it can change the rules at any time.\nOn LBRY, creators set their own price and our company, LBRY Inc., doesn't take any portion of it.\nPolicing illicit content\nCT: Like it or not, one of the advantages of centralization is the ability to pull content that is either stolen or otherwise misattributed, unsavory, or downright illegal. How can decentralization deal with these problems?\nMV: LBRY is a protocol, but today we are releasing an app that is like a window into that protocol. At the app level, we do have some ability to blacklist infringing content. Also, there may be technical ways through our position as the \"market maker\" of LBRY credits to basically make it more expensive for people to abuse the network. We've designed LBRY to make it easy to do the right thing: compensate talented creators for their work.\nThe point of decentralization is to push the power and the responsibility to the users, rather than having some large company in the position of making value judgments for hundreds of millions of people.\n\nCompetition for Netflix and other content platform giants\nCT: Large content providers like Netflix already exist which allow users to seamlessly access a massive amount of content very cheaply. How will LBRY distinguish itself from, and successfully compete with, more traditional paid content platforms?\nMV: For one, LBRY does everything. It can carry any form of digital media \u2013 songs, films, ebooks, games \u2013 so we'll have some advantage in having many different audiences coming to the same place and mixing their interests.\nLBRY also allows users to choose their content a la cart. Cryptocoins allow for micropayments in a way that Netflix couldn't process through credit cards. So rather than paying $10/month, you might pay a few pennies for each video you watch.\nNetflix is constrained by having to get licensing deals for interesting new content \u2013 or spending big bucks to create their own. LBRY doesn't control the platform, so it's up to creators or distributors to post their content themselves and set their own price. We don't license or otherwise claim to own what's added to the LBRY network. It's a different relationship, and one that we expect media producers large and small to come to see as way better than the old way.\nIn short, what Netflix did to Blockbuster, we could do to Netflix. Or who knows, maybe Netflix will appreciate how we've dramatically lowered the cost of serving content and start offering their service through LBRY!\nReduced incentives for pirating\nCT: Are you worried about pirating? It sounds like people could simply take LBRY's content and make it available for free on file sharing networks, or even sites like YouTube.", "birthday": "2016-07-05T11:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-05 10:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 5}

Last time we covered Hide My Ass, which is arguably the largest name in the industry. Now we move on to some of the lesser-known options - TunnelBear and ShadeYouVPN.\nTunnelBear\nTunnelBear is a very accessible and beautifully designed VPN. A simple sign-up procedure requires you to enter your name, email address and a desired password. After that is done, all you have to do is confirm your email, and you\u2019re good to go.\nThe company offers three possible tariff options:\n Free - you can use the basic tunneling service for free with a 500MB monthly download limit (can be increased by an extra 1GB if you make a tweet about the company); Monthly subscription - unlimited access to all features for $6.99 a month; Yearly subscription - same as above, but at an upfront price of $49.99 ($4.16 a month). \nThe payment options include Visa, MasterCard, American Express, jars of honey (yes, you read that right) and, of course, Bitcoin.\nThe VPN app itself is very simple: you choose either one of several available tunneling locations or just the closest tunnel, and turn it on with a single click. The connection is secured with AES-256 encryption, and a simple test on speedtest reveals that the app produces no more significant effect on latency/speed than you would expect from any other VPN.\nThe app supports all major platforms, such as Windows, Mac, iOS and Android.\n      \nTunnelBear has strict rules regarding logging user data: while they couldn\u2019t deal away with it completely, it has been brought to a minimum. The app only logs your operational data, such as an overall number of connections (without timestamps) and the total amount of data used each month.\nIt never logs IP addresses and does not monitor, collect, analyze or store any information about the applications, services or websites the users visit with TunnelBear on. The privacy policy promises to \u2018not disclose user information to other commercial parties under any circumstance.\u201d\nUltimately, TunnelBear is a secure, fast, simple-to-use option for people who want to protect their privacy at an affordable price. Its highlights are: the option to use it for free, simple interface, limited logging policy.\nShadeYouVPN\nShadeYouVPN represents a down-to-earth approach with the very cheap contracts. Users get exactly what they pay for - an easy, reliable VPN service.\nThe sign-up process is the same as with TunnelBear (with the exception that you have to enter a username instead of your actual name).\nThe company offers a one-day free trial, and there are three tariff options after that:\n A 12-month subscription for $25.99 ($2.17 a month). A 6-month subscription for $16.98 ($2.83 a month). Monthly renewal for $3.95 each month. ", "birthday": "2016-07-05T14:10:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-05 13:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 5}

The project is still in development, with 4 proof-of-concept versions already released, and a Kickstarter campaign in preparation.\nThe team behind Echo, a P2P messaging and digital payment app, has set out with the goal of delivering a solution which could be conveniently used by people who have never even heard about cryptocurrencies before.\nLive encryption and data storage\nEcho is planned to be capable of sending multimedia (which is stored with the use of IPFS), and also support live encryption of all audio and video streams.\nChristoph Hering, Echo\u2019s CEO, says:\n \u201cEcho will use IPFS for the multimedia data storage. So all information is decentralised and encrypted. We will send the IPFS hashcode via the Blockchain \u2018memo\u2019 field, so that only the receiver can read the message. Echo will be able to live encrypt all audio and video streams too: you can call your friends over a IPFS video stream etc.\u201d \nIn order to receive and interpret messages for the user, a decentralized messenger has to access the Blockchain, which can be a very resource-intensive, nearly unsolvable task for mobile devices. This is a major problem for all such applications.\nHering comments on this:\n \u201cWe have developed a specific light client for the Bitshares platform. So you just download the user specific data, not the whole chain. That saves battery, data and time.\u201d \n\nCentralized vs. decentralized\nInstant messaging is one of many industries, where Blockchain could be employed to produce an undeniably positive effect.\nThe most popular IM apps today are centralized: WhatsApp, Skype, Viber, Telegram - they all use corporate servers to send messages across the network.That means that the respective apps suffer all the deficiencies associated with centralization: downtime, security breaches, zero anonymity/privacy - you name it.\nThe result is a market waiting to be taken over by a secure, efficient, private chatting app powered by Blockchain. There have been several attempts so far, such as CoinSpark or Blockom. The trend is so prominent, that even DARPA and the Commonwealth of Nations are considering building Blockchain messengers for their own use.\nHowever, none of the decentralized solutions presented so far have managed to reach a degree of popularity enjoyed by the biggest legacy players in the industry. That can mostly be explained by the fact that none of them have been aimed at the general public: the projects by government agencies are being developed in complete secrecy; even the solutions which come from the private sector are largely geared towards experienced cryptocurrency users.\nSimpler money transfers\nIn addition to sending traditional messages, the app wants to solve the headache of bank money transfers. In a bid to support seamless money transfers via the Blockchain, Echo is planned to support simple transfers in such currencies as Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, USD, EUR, JPY, and others.\nThe users won\u2019t have to remember the receiver's addresses for different currencies, or any other specific data: they will be able to send to a username or via a QR-code. Businesses will also be able to accept payments via Echo by setting up an enterprise account.\nCointelegraph spoke to Christoph Hering about the project.\nCointelegraph: When will your crowdfunding begin? How soon do you plan to release a working app?\nChristoph Hering: We are currently preparing the crowdfunding and will publish a short video clip to answer the most burning questions of our early adopters, introducing the team and sharing our long term vision with ECHO within the next weeks. Moving forward, we will announce our crowdfunding campaign on multiple websites, forums and over social media.\nThe crowdfunding will start early August 2016. We have a very dedicated and passionate team and I plan to release the first alpha version of ECHO 6 months after the succesful crowdfunding. We also have a newsletter where we share the latest updates and news around the ECHO team.\nCT: Who are the closest competitors of Echo? How do you stand out?\nCH: The closest competitor would be WeChat, the Chinese social messenger giant that provides an omni platform for messaging, payments, shopping, social media and so on. I was blown away the first time I used WeChat in Shanghai. I really liked their easy to use interface that welcomes every new user immediately. However, 700 Million WeChat users suffer from censorship, non-encrypted communications and the centralized financial system WeChat Pay.", "birthday": "2016-07-05T14:50:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-05 13:50:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 5}

For how long will this correction last, and at which point is the long-term upward trend most likely to continue?\nWhat has caused the start of this correction?\nOne of the key long-term levels was near $760-80. A long-term downward trend has been forming along that price as far back as 2014. The price of $760-80 has become a key level.

There seems to be more Bitcoin enthusiasts who share insinuations that the halving will shoot the price to the moon than those who think it will go to the loom - or at least let the price remain unaffected. \nEach camp is clear and certain of the picture it has. What is dicey, however, is which to follow of both camps, especially if you are a Bitcoin enthusiast with a keen interest in what becomes of the digital currency. It is nearly unimaginable what the price will be when more regular people buy Bitcoin with a limited fixed supply. \nNegative factors \nSeveral developments have not helped the situation. Recently, we had the Brexit vote which pushed the boundary of the digital currency\u2019s level of adoption upwards as global currency markets were shaken up. The EU credit rating has been downgraded to AA from AA+ which is also a blow. \nIt is gradually becoming a common discussion that Bitcoin seems to be the only blockchain system that has seen use outside of those who are tech-savvy because it fulfils a need. \nIn its third report on blockchain, this being to analyze whether a technology like Bitcoin has the potential to offer a superior alternative to the financial system today, Citigroup cited that \"cryptocurrencies' potential impact will likely be more from its ability to open up new markets and reach new customers\" in the financial sector. In addition, a whopping 71% of polled respondents thinks the U.S. economic system is \"rigged in favor of certain groups,\" according to a new poll by Marketplace and Edison Research. \nThe other blow is to the credit card industry. A court threw out a $7.25 billion antitrust settlement reached by Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc with millions of retailers that accused the card networks of improperly fixing credit and debit card fees. After the Uncertainty, the economy and policy speech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, the market dipped slightly. \nGuessing the Bitcoin price \nThe only hard data available presently is the price history which has no predictive value, making it hard to depend on to make predictions, says a comment on Reddit. What is certain, however, is today\u2019s price of Bitcoin. Anything else is guesswork as shared in the views of Reddit users. \nFor example, user jmw74 says that nobody knows how much 'buy and hold' and 'sell and stay in fiat' has been happening. As exchange volume is mostly just trading back and forth, it doesn't tell you anything. The amount of 'sell and stay in fiat' aside from miners has been tiny.

The flourishing Israeli tech ecosystem, boasting the highest concentration of tech companies outside of Silicon Valley, provides fertile ground for pushing DLT forward.\nOne of the biggest proponents for this is the fact that cyber security and cryptography play a key role in the Israeli defense establishment, and the military serves as a potent incubator for these fields. The current climate is reminiscent of the development of the cyber industry in the early 2000's.\nA vibrant profit-driven private sector coupled with passionate and talented entrepreneurs, sees an early influx of capital. This, in turn, attracts the attention of the government which utilizes its regulatory and institutional powers to allow for an increase in capital, both financial and human, including the establishment of relevant supportive institutions, incentivizing academia, and generating a substantial amount of buzz.\nResearch and development\nIsraeli universities are home to a number of Blockchain research pioneers, including Turing Award winner Professor Adi Shamir of the Weizman Institute of Science and Prof. Eli Ben-Sasson of the Technion.\nIn the private sector, as per a recent report\u00a0by the global consulting firm Deloitte, there are dozens of Israeli startups developing a wide-range of Blockchain technologies, in various sectors including security, hardware, virtual currency, payments, P2P and social platforms.\nFor example, a startup offering a Blockchain solution to eliminate the need for documents in international shipping agreements, an application for secure and validated purchase and storing of goods online, and another creating Blockchain data templates for use by banks and enterprises.\nRegulator\u2019s dilemma\nWhile the Israeli Blockchain eco-system is vibrant, the Israeli regulator is still 'sitting on the fence'.

Gox scandals certainly did not lend any additional credence to the enterprise. But beyond understandable concern for criminal misuse and consumer protection, it is clear that resistance may be more deeply rooted: any decentralized alternative to centuries-old systems of centralized governance and control is not something any regulator can swallow too easily.\nPublic and private\nIn this way Israel is somewhat unique. Due to the small size of the Israeli industry, there is constant friction between the private and public sectors. This leads to an unlikely type of interaction between the two, and oftentimes creates an almost unavoidable, albeit sometimes wary, alliance.", "birthday": "2016-07-06T16:24:00+01:00", "date": "2016-07-06 15:24:00", "year": 2016, "month": 7, "day": 6}

This way, every person gets to have a direct say in the fate of legislation that is important to them.\u201d \nAccording to Kaye, the levels of disengagement and disaffection with the political system has never been higher in Australia and comparable democracies.\nAs a result, the Flux Party is tapping into that concern by offering a way for people to reclaim some control over the decisions made in their name by combining the principles of participatory democracy with the benefits of technology.\nWhat is the Flux Party?\nKaye explains that the idea behind the Flux Party originated after the 2013 elections when he had been on polling booths all day and was disappointed watching the results come in.\nHe says:\n \u201cNot just because my party hadn\u2019t won a seat, but because there was just so much waste. Thousands of people around the country had got out on polling day, tried to get someone elected, and our democracy threw all that effort back in their faces.\u201d \nHe then started thinking of ways to avoid the waste and how to work with minor parties. Over the next three years he met fellow co-founder, Nathan Spataro, the Flux Party leader, where they refined the design, and started a political party.\nDespite the fact that they have only attracted over 3,700 members, they have done so in a relatively short period of time.

Cointelegraph interviewed Gary Miliefsky, CEO of cyber-security firm SnoopWall, about the security risks facing mobile device Bitcoin wallet users.\nCointelegraph: Bitcoin smartphone wallets: how secure are they?\nGary Miliefsky: Smartphone wallets are completely insecure. There have been over 500 million downloads of emoji keyboards: keyloggers, spyware disguised as friendly emoticon keyboards. When you startup your smartphone wallet the first time, you may enter bitcoin info or add username/password credentials. These are shipped off to criminal servers remotely because of this kind of keyboard malware.\nMany of these QR code and barcode scanners come from legitimate sources like eBay, Zxing, Scan Inc, and DroidLa. Despite this, SnoopWall still deems many of them voluntary creepware. The reason for this is that many have intrusive permissions that allow them to geolocate you, read your contacts, access USB storage, read your call log, make phone calls, and even record audio. Most of these permissions are legitimate, as most of these apps allow the user to generate information like phone numbers, contacts, and locations as scan-able QR codes.\n\nCT: Is this only a concern with aftermarket keyboards, or does this happen with standard iPhone and Android keyboard apps?\nGM: Aftermarket keyboards.

Don't run risky third party apps - make sure they ONLY USE the PERMISSIONS they need to operate. Delete all the apps you never use. When using your wallet, make sure NO background apps running: anything on Android and only 4 options on Apple: VPN, emoji keyboard, audio players, alarm clocks.

Brexit is by far the hottest topic at the moment, and debates about potential implications of such a bold move are intensifying.\nLondon crowned a global fintech capital\nIn 2015, the British fintech sector generated \u00a36.6 billion in revenues and attracted approximately \u00a3524 million in investment, according to EY, a professional service firm. UK fintech firms employ about 6,000 people which is about 5% of the total financial service workforce. That makes the UK larger than New York, Singapore, and Hong Kong competing for a status of the world\u2019s fintech hub.\nThe UK has been at the forefront of the financial technology revolution with companies specializing in lending and money transfer feeling quite confident supported by government initiatives to help investment in a sector that is growing quite rapidly.\nFintech is hit hard in this game of truth or dare\nHowever, following last Thursday\u2019s referendum some fintech business players and investors have already started questioning the future of business in the UK. So, is the UK going to lose its status of the world\u2019s fintech hub?\nUK, being a member of the EU, offers technology companies a number of advantages. First of all, any businesses regulated by the UK authorities can \u2018passport\u2019 their products across the European Economic Area, therefore businesses\u2019 concerns of whether the situation might change are fair.\nBrain drain possible\nAs many fintech companies employ developers from countries like Portugal and Poland, the general worry that occupies fintech companies\u2019 leaders is a brain drain of talent and skills. Brexit might make it more expensive and complicated to attract and retain staff.\nIn addition, companies are bound to a number of EU regulations about data protection. Currently, the European Commission is trying to harmonize rules across the EU in areas such as data protection and copyright by pushing through the \u2018Digital Single Market\u2019 agenda.\nTrade implications\nThe question of the movement of the free labor and trade implications also concerns businesses in general, including fintech players. Brexit might also make it harder for companies to attract investment.\nDiana Paredes, Co-founder of Suade\u00a0shared her concerns:\n \u201cBrexit will change things dramatically for London\u2019s fintech community. The pool of banks that fintech companies can access out of London may be reduced. Everyone in fintech is now weighing up in which other European jurisdiction they should open an office\u201d. \nForced to leave a warm nest?\nThere are over 500 fintech companies in the UK, some of them are now deciding on which way to go. Location is a very crucial issue. A friendly regulatory framework and strong political support for the sector allowed fintech business to flourish in the UK. However, Brexit might force many companies to reconsider their position. The challenge of relocating the business is bigger than just finding new premises, packing up offices and covering relocation costs. Moving to a new location means that business relationships will have to be re-established, access to key markets could be lost and customer confidence will be negatively affected.\nEdan Yago, founder of Epiphyte, specializing in making transactions using Blockchain technology, warned that his company might have to consider leaving the UK in case the tension in country\u2019s relationships with the EU increases.\nUK Business Secretary: There is no need for panic\nOn Tuesday UK Business Secretary Sajid Javid held an emergency roundtable with UK business groups to discuss the implications of the Brexit vote.\nLeaders from the CBI, Institute of Directors and British Chamber of Commerce, EEF representing manufacturing and BBA which represents banks and the British Retail Consortium were among the more than 20 representatives of business groups and figures from the UK\u2019s most important industries at the meeting.\nWhile business leaders in the UK are very concerned about what is going to follow further, Sajid Javid said that there is no need to panic and assured that keeping the UK\u2019s access to the single market will be a priority during further negotiations with the EU.\nPerhaps, seeking to avoid fintech businesses slipping away from the UK, the government will seize the opportunity to offer a more attractive tax regime and friendly regulations. Eventually we may see London becoming an even more attractive hub for fintech and start-ups than it has been before.\nBrexit or Grexit - a chance to exit centralized financial system\nAnticipating the UK referendum Cointelegraph had a chance to talk to a few of the fintech business players at MoneyConf held in Madrid and hear their opinion on the impact of Brexit.\nJoshua Scigala from Vaultoro\u00a0explained:\n \u201cBrexit will certainly set a big precedent.

In-between the inspirational keynotes and thought-provoking panel discussions Cointelegraph had a chat with Darrell MacMullin, CEO of BitGold.\nMoneyConf is an invite-only event organized by experts behind Web Summit, the world\u2019s fastest growing technology event, and focused on the future of finance. This year more than 1500 decision makers from across the industry, including over 100 exhibiting startups looking to revolutionize the industry came to sunny Madrid.\nChallenges of digital currencies\nMacMullin says to Cointelegraph about the DAO attack:\n \u201cIt is exciting to see what is going on with different cryptocurrencies. The situation around the DAO hack and how serious this is, is still rather unclear. Many conventional systems have been hacked many times. Take, for instance, the Swift\u00a0system which was hacked a few times last year. The biggest concern here is of course the reputation and gaining of trust, if you are trying to build a currency and make people use it as a primary currency making them invest in it.\u201d \nThe fact that in the case of digital currencies you are dealing with just the digital ledger and digital token is rather challenging. Any attack to the ledger is therefore putting all the system at great risk. The other downside of digital currencies, as mentioned by Darrell, is that all transactions are anonymous which makes it difficult to resolve the problem if something goes wrong.\n\nClosed loop private ledger\nBitGold offers a platform for buying, selling, or redeeming gold using BitGold\u2019s Aurum payment and settlement technology.\nMacMullin explains:\n \u201cAt BitGold and GoldMoney, one of the benefits we have is that we are dealing with the physical gold. We have built a digital ledger and it is a closed loop private ledger. Even if we were to get hacked our system has a capability to reverse all the paths. Even if someone was to get in and mess around with the ledger we still have all the physical gold.\u201d \nThe ledger is being backed up constantly and every time someone buys gold using BitGold platform a special serialized barcode is dedicated to it.\nAccording to MacMullin, the system is highly secure and it is almost impossible to hack it, \u201cunless there is a simultaneous physical attack along with the digital attack on the ledger, but it is very unlikely,\u201d he says.\nEthereum vs Bitcoin\nThere was an opinion that Ethereum will eventually replace Bitcoin, however the DAO attack has caused some doubts concerning the future of Ethereum and its ability to take on a leading position.\nMacMullin shares his view:\n \u201cI don\u2019t think this attack will put an end to Ethereum. It is certainly a blow in trust, however, I think that the community behind Ethereum responded more than correctly - they are getting behind it trying to resolve the issue and put Ethereum in place.\u201d \nIn his view, the race between Ethereum and Bitcoin is not about one replacing the other. Both currencies have their support communities, which are rather large, and if they do not replace each other, there is certainly going to be an overlap between them.\nMacMullin explains:\n \u201cI like what Ethereum is doing on a whole bunch of different levels.

No wonder, as the world got to know about the Blockchain primarily because of the cryptocurrency built on its basis. The more these financial sector players researched this technology, the more we heard about mysterious thing called Blockchain.\nHowever, as more and more enthusiasts from the non-financial sectors dive into researching the potential of technology, new real-life applications of technology occur. It comes as no surprise that non-bank institutions are joining the consortium.\nPotential for Blockchain beyond finances\nToyota Financial Services are among the latest member to join R3 group. The partnership is to become a very interesting experiment in merging distributed ledgers with automotive financial services. Toyota is reportedly joining a global network of consortium partners and becoming a part of R3 Lab and Research Center. The strategy of the partnership between Toyota and R3 is driven by the common goal to research and test distributed ledgers with a focus on non-financial use-cases. The finance arm of the car maker sees a high potential for Blockchain in that particular sector.\nChris Ballinger, CEO and Global Chief Officer for strategic innovation at Toyota Financial Services, says:\n \u201cBeyond finance, we believe additional applications of the technology in auto manufacturing and sales will benefit our customers by making mobility more affordable and available.

In 2016, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India\u2019s Central Bank released a concept paper titled \u2018Card Acceptance Infrastructure\u2019.\nMerchants discourage cards use\nThe paper noted that whilst there has been a significant increase in electronic transactions in India, the growth has not occurred uniformly in all segments. In fact card usage in India is invisible in many areas. Many merchants actively discourage customers from paying with a card, particularly for smaller transactions and may even charge 1-2% extra for payment processing.\nNumber of debit cards grows exponentially\nAt present, there has been a growth of card usage but mainly at ATMs. Usage of debit cards, for example, grew by 64 per cent between October of 2013 and 2015, while credit card usage rose by 23 per cent in the same time frame. By the end of December of 2015, there were 22.74 million credit cards in use in India and 636.85 million debit cards. One of the reasons for the exponential rise in debit cards in India is the government\u2019s Jan Dhan Yojna, a scheme of financial inclusiveness, which allows people to open bank accounts and receive India\u2019s home grown RuPay branded debit cards.\n\n- Source: Reserve Bank of India\nAccording to the RBI, the rate of card transactions per head in India is one of the lowest in the world and is at the level of 6.7 now.

Thus, the usage of cards has been constrained by lack of accessible acceptance infrastructure, especially in rural areas where the growth in card issuance has been very high in recent times.\u201d\nCash is a headache\nIn its report \u2018Disrupting Cash - Accelerating electronic payments in India\u2019, Price Waterhouse Cooper observes:", "birthday": "2016-06-27T14:45:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-27 13:45:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 27}

Brexit took place, and most world currencies underwent a fall, and have also stopped at minimums established in Spring 2016. Is there a connection, or is this just a coincidence?\nBrexit as a reason for the upward dollar trend to continue\nLast Friday, June 24 the UK finally said goodbye to the European Union. As a consequence, most of the world currencies have significantly dropped in relation to the dollar. In our previous analysis we reported that most currencies have reached their minimal long-term correction targets. Thus, when looking at the big picture, the dollar\u2019s price has reached the minimal targets of its movement towards the long-term upward trend. It\u2019s a surprising coincidence for all world currencies to reach their correction targets simultaneously with the release of such serious news. We have stated many times that whenever news impacts the price rates, they just put the already prepared scenarios in motion.\n\nWorld currecncies have reached the minimums which were established from March to June 2016.\nOne more curious coincidence is the fact that altcoins reached those targets much earlier.\nEthereum\u2019s price fell down to the level, which has been forming since the beginning of June.

The direction of the trend is most likely to change at that mark. The correction will grow into a wave of an upward long-term trend. A fortification at that mark will indicate that the support for the downward trend, which was there earlier, is gone. If that is the case, the bulls are going to win the advantage, and there will be a chance for a sharp rise towards the maximum of the long-term upward trend.

Burma is one such emerging economy. In such countries providing banking services to those who have been the most ignored by mainstream economy can bring about significant benefits.\nIn neighbouring Bangladesh, microfinance has been hailed as a great success and nearly 700 microfinance institutions are operational which have been disbursing Bangladesh Taka 647 billion to nearly 34 million active borrowers according to the think tank, Copenhagen Consensus.\nBurma as an emerging fintech landscape\nAccording to the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), the demand for microfinance in Burma is four times the current supply and is one of the reasons why the country is finding it hard to develop as it becomes more open. It is, therefore, of vital importance that microfinance institutions in Burma receive support in the form of technological assistance and otherwise.\nRecently Infoteria Corporation and the Tech Bureau Corporation of Japan have been working with BC Finance Holdings Limited on experiments which are based on Tech Bureau\u2019s Mijin Platform. Mijin is a private Blockchain placed on Microsoft Azure using ASTERIA WARP and Mijin adapters.\nUsing this technology Infoteria and Techbureau have been successful in transferring loan and deposit account data in the main system of Burma\u2019s BC finance. This demonstration was carried out between May 28 and June 5, 2016.\nThe experiment was successfully conducted as Infoteria and Techbureau could record all the transaction history of one of the 19 branches of BC Finance in the private Blockchain Mijin.\nWe asked Jeremy Kloiser-Jones, Founder and CEO of BC Finance Holdings Limited, about the successful test of Blockchain technology in a microfinance environment.\nHe said:\n \u201cThis test represents an internal application of Blockchain technology running against our core banking system. All indications are that this test is proceeding well. Naturally, we then look forward to Mijin supporting a new type of core banking system. We are glad to provide input from the user\u2019s perspective and aid the development of this. Concurrently, we have plans to apply Blockchain elsewhere as a base or component of various services - one of which will be announced in the coming weeks. \u00a0We are focused on practical applications.\u201d \nDeveloping markets can benefit from Fintech innovations\nAt the moment even in Burma the fintech landscape is rather limited. However, there are possibilities that are emerging due to the country embracing openness.\nMobile penetration has increased from 10 per cent four years ago, to 50 per cent at the moment. Mobile penetration can act as an important delivery channel for microfinance companies.\nThe Burmese economy is now growing at the rate of 8.5 per cent p.a. And, thus, there is a need for more of everything according to Jeremy Kloiser-Jones of BC Finance.\nTakao Asayama, CEO of Tech Bureau Corp, whose platform is being used by BC Finance has his own take on developing countries and the potential Fintech applications. He thinks that most developing countries, including Burma, have been using legacy technologies to run their operations. He cites the example of BC Finance who uses Excel spreadsheets to manage loans and then pushes those to a database daily. He thinks to upgrade that to an enterprise financial system could cost millions of dollars and may need reliable system integrators from overseas.\nUsing Blockchain things can be relatively simpler.\nAsayama says:\n \u201cHowever, with a Blockchain, they can build a ledger system that can handle all transactions with digital signatures, and the data cannot be manipulated at all. \u00a0Blockchain will solve the problems of developing countries to easily compress their budgets down to, say, 1/10 or 1/100. Also, microfinance is a aggregation of very small transactions, which can be summed up to a large chunk of fee using the existing banking infrastructure. Blockchain can potentially eliminate those fees and bring better user experiences to microfinance.\u201d \nDeveloping countries may be easier to operate in\nWhile developed countries may present an easier landscape to innovate, existing regulations make it difficult to get things off the ground in some cases. Developing countries in this way are more exciting for Fintech companies.\nAsayama explains:\n \u201cUsually those developing countries have fewer hurdles and fewer rules when welcoming new technologies. There may be totally different rules which we have to overcome, but I can say that there is a better chance, compared to developed countries such as Japan, to implement Blockchain in their financial services. For example, Japan has FISC guidelines which forces banks to protect servers in a separated and isolated world, but Blockchain technology even allows servers run on the Internet, exposed to the public, without compromising its security levels. So, even when faced with political or cultural hurdles, developing countries have \u00a0the \u00a0chance to implement Blockchain much faster than others, even to compete with developed countries, I believe.\u201d \nThe future of Techbureau, Infoteria and BC Finance experiment\nThat Blockchain technology has started to make a real impact on the lives of people in developing countries is a positive development. We asked both Jeremy Kloiser-Jones and Takao Asayama about the future possibilities of using their technology in developing nations.\nKloiser-Jones is of the view that there is a big future for this technology and he expects it to contribute greatly to BC Finance\u2019s ability in providing flexible services to a broad audience of the underbanked. He says that they have started in Myanmar, but have a number of other countries in their sights for expansion.", "birthday": "2016-06-28T16:34:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-28 15:34:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 28}

Additionally, there was a presentation on the decentralized online marketplace OpenBazaar, and an update from the decentralized content platform LBRY, including the \u00a0screening of films via Blockchain, touted as the first in history.\nMatt Welch, editor at large of the libertarian publication Reason, commented on the distinct crypto-anarchist focus of the festival:\n \u201cI assume just from being here for a grand total of four or five hours and hearing conversationally at least five references to Blockchain technology (and importantly it not having Bitcoin be the word, it\u2019s actually Blockchain), that crypto-anarchy remains fundamental to the current libertarian sense of itself. It is a wing, that wing is with us, it\u2019s growing, it\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s throwing off some of the more interesting activities, and tonight we\u2019re going to see the first Blockchain movie at 8 o\u2019clock, here on this compound.

He is also a strong proponent of decentralization and has it incorporated into much of their work.\nProof of index\nAn interesting example of this is their twist on their custom blockchains: without interfering with the decentralization aspect they have implemented a \u2018proof of index\u2019 instead of a proof of work upon which Ethereum and Bitcoin rely so heavily on.\nJawad says:\n \u201cDeOS is a decentralized OS which uses the blockchain as its register. It works by constantly indexing and allocating resources in the network for execution. Resources include items such as memory, cpu, storage, and bandwidth, assets, smart contracts etc. Each\u00a0DeOS seed node indexes its available resources, and publishes this index to the network along with a list of tasks it wishes to perform on the network.\u201d \u201cOther nodes compare indices to see if new resources can be aggregated or connected to serve the tasks. By \u2018solving the index\u2019 the available resources and mapping them to tasks allows DeOS to create multiple \u2018Execution Environments\u2019 within which processes run securely and in a decentralized manner across the whole network of machines.\u201d \u201cThe Proof of Index means the first node to publish the successful mapping of tasks to available resources gets that block added to the mother chain.\u201d\u00a0 \nI asked Jawad about the genesis of their products and he had this to say:", "birthday": "2016-06-28T17:16:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-28 16:16:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 28}

The aim was to improve the bank\u2019s digital banking services. Deutsche Bank\u2019s Blockchain project is now out of the \u2018proof of concept\u2019 stage.\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s labs are based in Berlin, London and Palo Alto. Their Palo Alto lab\u2019s aim is to evaluate emerging technologies from Silicon Valley and apply them to enhance their products. The three innovation labs termed as \u2018Deutsche Bank Labs\u2019 are a part of the Bank\u2019s Strategy 2020 and Deutsche Bank has earmarked the sum of \u20ac1 billion on such initiatives for the next five years.\nWhy Bitcoin matters to Deutsche Bank\nDeutsche Bank is not unique in utilising Blockchain as a technology as many other banks have been doing so now for a while whilst others are in the process of exploring it.\nThe bank\u2019s Chief Digital Officer Edward Budd has this to say about Blockchain in a bank\u2019s press release,\n \u201cDeutsche Bank is running a portfolio of activities for Blockchain/distributed ledger technology across the bank. Some of these innovative activities are driven internally and facilitated by the Deutsche Bank Innovation Labs. In other areas where we cannot - or would not - look to test on our own, we collaborate with industry partners such as the market consortium DLG R3.\u201d \nThe DAO incident was a wakeup call\nRegarding the DAO incident, Deutsche Bank told Cointelegraph in an e-mailed answer,\n \u201cTo those of us focused on getting this out of the lab and into production use in markets, it has served as a good and timely reminder on the importance of clear governance/standards and production assurance. These are mandatory elements for a regulated entity to consider when putting any technology into production either individually or as part of a market scheme. They will be the core pillars of the schemes needed to run the private/permissioned blockchains logical for transaction banking product lines.\u201d \nHowever, the Bank was also categorical in making it clear that this incident would not cast a shadow on the future Blockchain plans which are being run across Deutsche Bank.

Online VPN Service ", "content": "Using the Internet is a right, or a privilege, that many people take for granted. Many apps, social networks, and search engines collect user data and have proceeded to centralize the Internet over time, without much notice by the masses.\nThe tracking of user\u2019s IP address and location information is now just a part of the online tapestry. Many go through this form of surveillance unwittingly, but a decent number choose to use Virtual Private Networks (VPN\u2019s) which work to protect the online privacy of users in a less and less private world.\nToday, we\u2019ll take a look at Hide My Ass!, one of the long-time VPN leaders.\nWhat do I have to hide?\nWithout laboring the point made above, if you are online the chances are that some company or third-party is tracking your online usage. In Western culture, a laissez-faire attitude is pervasive with regards to protecting this privacy and people are often either apathetic or ignorant. Though it\u2019s the norm to live behind locked doors and shaded windows, for many, what they do online is a different matter. Besides online privacy, there are many good reasons to use a VPN. \u00a0\nHide My Ass!, or HMA, offers one of the largest VPN networks available online with almost 1000 servers, 125k IP address and 190 countries to choose from. Full disclosure, I have used them as my VPN for three years and their large, versatile network is the main reason I continue to use them. This is not a press release or advertisement, this is a user review.\nMain features\nThis massive network has a few advantages. One, you should get a good online service regardless of your location. You can live behind The Great Firewall of China and not be limited as to what your government says you can access online. If there is content not available in your region, pick a desired server and location and you will have instant access to it. If you want to watch a sporting event in another part of the world, your access may be limited by region or by a site\u2019s own firewall, such as ESPN may use, so a good VPN can help you navigate these blockades easily.\nYou have an simple UI that allows the automatic re-setting of your IP address at any interval you desire. If you want your IP address to change every 6 hours or every ten minutes, this is easily done in Settings. This amount of adjustability is good and bad, as I learned trying use my BTC to make a purchase on Overstock.com.\nTheir shopping cart seems to ignore your entered address, but works off of their tracking of your IP address, making purchases more difficult. This underlines the reasons to have the service to begin with, but you may need to set the service to your mailing address to use certain sites which will track you. My disappointment with Overstock had me using Target to get the same item by fiat instead of their Bitcoin-friendly service. Tracking me online is gonna cost you.\nAnother benefit are the variations in server strength from place to place. If you are in Argentina, you won\u2019t have the world\u2019s fastest servers, which in my experience are clustered around Florida, primarily in Miami. So if you are not in Miami or Orlando, your download speeds for YouTube and streaming videos could be better, and a VPN like Hide My Ass! gives you that access to the world\u2019s best-performing servers.\nIf you use YouTube a lot, as I do, you will notice a huge difference in the download times of HD videos based solely upon the server you use. Your local server will not be very swift versus the fastest server\u2019s in HMA\u2019s extensive network, provided you live outside of The Sunshine State.", "birthday": "2016-06-29T17:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-29 16:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 29}

As a result, \u00a0online investment companies which deal with cryptocurrencies have recently become increasingly perceived with a negative bias. Scammers these days seem to ride on the anonymous characteristics of the industry to deceive unsuspecting investors.\nHashOcean and others\nThe latest incidence involved a supposed Bitcoin cloud mining company Hashocean whose website was inaccessible for about five days. Also, among the supposed scammers is OneFxZone, a self-acclaimed trading company who still claim to be honest, but their investors complain of their inability to access their funds.\nCointelegraph asked experts why scams now seem to be on the increase and how potential investors can figure out which prospect is genuine and which is not.\nThe three most common areas of Bitcoin scam\nCo-Founder and Director at SatoshiLabs, Alena Vranova tells Cointelegraph that the rise of scams and Bitcoin thefts come hand-in-hand with the rising price of Bitcoin.\n \u201cThe correlation was shown clearly in the Dell Secure Works research conducted in early 2014.\u201d \nVranova identifies the three most common areas where Bitcoin thefts or scams occur as: through a third-party fraud, digital exposure and human error or ignorance. She says that the digital and third-party risks can be easily mitigated today with a hardware wallet such as TREZOR while distributing the risk is usually a good common practice in any investment.\u00a0\u00a0\n \u201cSome voices call for more regulation against fraudsters exploiting poorly informed clients. I am quite opposed to that idea. In \u00a0any financial services and investment opportunities, a fraud is very common, and the Bitcoin world is not an exception. As a \u2018small\u2019 example we can look at the insurance industry. The UK represents over 7% of the global insurance market and faces over 2 billion pounds in insurance fraud annually. Let's assume that the global scale of insurance fraud could be around 20 billion pounds. Now, most of those frauds are done with the help or direct involvement of independent insurance brokers and agents who usually obtain their licenses from a central bank or a similar state-regulated organization. On top of the losses, insurance companies are investing hundreds of millions into fraud prevention and legislators invent new obscure \u2018consumer protection\u2019 rules. Yet \u00a0the preventive effects of the latter are questionable and the cost of insurance only rises.\u201d \n\nMoney invested is no longer yours\nHowever, Vranova points out that most investors do not realise their proper position and level of vulnerability once signed-up for any such investment packages.\n \u201cUnfortunately people don't realize that it's not their funds when they transfer their Bitcoin (or money) to someone else's account: \u2018It is only a promise to hold and eventually grow the sum for me.\u201d \nBitcoin is Less Vulnerable than Dollar or Euro\nIn conclusion, Vranova says that the good news for Bitcoin is that it may be actually less prone to fraud than the US dollar or Euro. As Bitcoin is an open ledger and an open community, it is relatively easier to get feedback from the community, do research on the companies, their teams and investment parameters before making decisions.\nGreed, Logic and Education\nThe Founder of Cryptopay, a UK Bitcoin payment gateway, George Basiladze, says that the only thing which is responsible for online scams is people\u2019s greed.\nAccording to Basiladze, most of the scam projects and Ponzi schemes are so easy to expose as long as greed does not get in the way. He also points out that anybody willing to undertake any form of investment must seek to understand the specific market and exercise patience.", "birthday": "2016-06-29T16:05:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-29 15:05:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 29}

The wallet combines elements of social messaging platforms with payment via Bitcoin, allowing senders and receivers to talk to each other with the option to top-up mobile phones with prepaid minutes within the Caribbean.\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Karsten Becker, Caricoin CEO, said that the mobile wallet was designed as a substitute to traditional banking, where, according to the World Bank 2015\u00a0Global Findex Report, around 50% of the population is unbanked.\nBecker notes:\n \u201cAccess to banks is hard for most of the population especially for people living in rural areas. Even harder than actually getting to banks is the process of signing up for an account due to an out-dated KYC [Know-Your-Customer] process and strict regulations.\u201d \nBig potential for Bitcoin in Jamaica\nBecker said that there was a large need in Jamaica for a mobile money platform that would provide easy access to digital bill payments and incoming remittances. Despite the fact that Jamaica has extremely high smart phone coverage, people still have to travel large distances at a great cost to pay their bills, with payment companies taking large cuts of the money.\nHe underlines:\n \u201cJamaica is unique in that over 80% of people have smartphones and 4g coverage along with very low cost data plans, so we hope to see more and more people coming on board as the ecosystem starts to grow.\u201d \nOf course, with the right marketing and access to mobile phones with data, Becker believes that anything is possible with people signing up in remote areas to take advantage of a system that allows them to access Bitcoins so that they can use them.\nHe said:\n \u201cOur goal was to try to get a platform to market which could help people with these problems and that, at the same time, could be used across the Caribbean. Bitcoin provides the perfect platform to do this since it is a currency which can be used in any country, is safe and secure, and works well on mobile devices.\u201d ", "birthday": "2016-06-30T09:46:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-30 08:46:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 30}

India is second in population size to China. Imagine if only 0.5 billion individuals got into the market. Huge potential. For some time now, Indian merchants were able to accept payments in Bitcoin but just not receive a payout in INR. Now, Indian merchants can accept payments in Bitcoin and receive a payout in INR. Bitcoin is no longer just an \u2018investment\u2019 in India but an opportunity to buy goods from Bitcoin accepting merchants.\u201d \nIndia, a tech haven\nCoinsecure will be the first company to use BitPay\u2019s platform to offer Bitcoin payment processing to merchants in India and southern Asia. Aside from its population, India is a tech haven with many freelance software developers operating locally to serve a global market. This will likely ease the adoption level among the tech-savvy service providers to the wider populace. \u00a0\nOn whether the India/South Asia region is a good market for Bitcoin, Kalra says:\n \u201cAgain, India has the second largest global population and many pain points with traditional options for payment. It is very difficult for individuals to obtain and use credit and debit cards in India and many do not have access to bank accounts. The fact that individuals can now obtain Bitcoins in India but also make purchases in Bitcoin, opens the door for further international e-commerce as well as enables individuals who do not have credit and debit cards to make purchases online. One other key element which can truly shakeup the Bitcoin acceptance in India is remittance.

As for a general currency substitute to replace the euro, the Bitcoin ecosystem has at least another 3 to 4 years of maturing before there will be enough options and simplicity for the general population.

Bitcoin is entering its halving event in less than three weeks, so now is the time to expect great volatility.\nSingh has submitted the following analysis in regards to the global Bitcoin markets as of late. Not surprisingly, it all starts in Bitcoin\u2019s largest mining and exchange market. \u201cChina,\u201d says Singh to Bloomberg West.\nHe continues:\n \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of activity having China\u2019s (Yuan) price run up about a month ago, and the Yuan was starting to be devalued, and capital controls were starting to go into effect. The people were using (Bitcoin) as a way to get some money into a currency that is not being depreciated.\u201d \nBrexit, gold, silver and Bitcoin halving\nSingh also made sure to note that Bitcoin was up over 35% in 2015. In comparison, the U.S. Dollar rose less than 10% last year.\nNext up is the Brexit vote this week. As seen last summer during the \u201cGrexit\u201d fiasco, Singh suggests Bitcoin could be seen as an international investment \u2018safe haven\u2019 in this time of national and regional economic uncertainty, on par with precious metals like gold and silver, and the facts back up his claim. Since June 1st, silver is up about 10% and gold is not far behind. Other countries like Brazil and Venezuela, with faltering economies, are also increasing Bitcoin usage year by year, buoying trading value.\n\n\nThe easy answer is the Bitcoin halving, currently scheduled for July 10th. Singh confirmed with Chinese exchanges that the halving is fuelling speculators in China to move in on Bitcoin this month, hoping the value increases later this year.\nOddly, Bloomberg host Cory Johnson called the buying strategy \u201cstupid,\u201d comparing the Bitcoin halving to the value of one large potato chip having more value than two small potato chips.\n70% of Bitcoin transactions are international", "birthday": "2016-06-21T12:50:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-21 11:50:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 21}

But when its idea was born and who are its founding fathers?\nThe birth of the idea\nWhen was the idea of Ethereum born?\nSome say it happened in 2009, with the appearance of Bitcoin as the first ever practical solution of decentralization. There is no doubt that seeing Blockchain succeed in the form of a payment protocol has had a great influence on Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum.\nHowever, a more particular date would be 2012. That year, Buterin left the University of Waterloo to travel the world and take part in different cryptocurrency projects for six months. It was during this trip that the Russian-born Canadian Vitalik Buterin conceived the idea of Ethereum, a cryptoeconomically-secured platform for development of any kinds of decentralized applications.\nVitalik\u2019s main fields of academic interest are information theory, cryptography, sociology, politics and economics. Ethereum was born at the intersection of those disciplines as an instrument for building more secure, trustworthy and wasteless systems than ever before.\nButerin\u2019s Whitepaper\nSoon after, Vitalik began drafting the Ethereum Whitepaper. The document provided a justification for the development of a new technology, outlined its fundamental principles and possible applications. It was the crucial step in the development of a new protocol to sort out the idea\u2019s primordial soup. The Whitepaper was published in late 2013, and about a month later, on January 23, 2014, Vitalik announced the start of Ethereum project on the Bitcointalk forum.\nIn his post, Buterin revealed that he was cooperating with Dr. Gavin Wood and Jeffrey Wilcke as principal core developers. Wood, a self-styled free-trust technologist, took the major part in Ethereum\u2019s development after Buterin himself. He published his \u201cYellow Paper\u201d, the formal specification of Ethereum Virtual Machine, in April 2014. He then helped code its first functional implementation into seven programming languages. This marked the creation of the first prototype of Ethereum platform.\n\nEthereum Foundation and the issue of tokens\nBitcoin, like Ethereum, is based on the Blockchain tech, but this alone would mean nothing unless \u00a0backed up by the most powerful computing network in history. Major investors and individuals poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the Bitcoin ecosystem, spending the money on mining equipment, trading, associated business solutions and technologies.\nLaunching a similar network requires the same, if not larger effort. In order to kickstart a community of developers, miners, and investors, the Ethereum foundation decided to conduct a presale of more than 60 million digital tokens, the Ethers. The Ethereum Foundation, a legal entity based in Zug, Switzerland, was created in June 2014, to manage the legal and marketing efforts associated with the crowdfunding campaign. The campaign was covered by major publications, both from the cryptocurrency media and others. The campaign turned out to be a major success, earning the Foundation more than $18 million in just 42 days. It has become the 5th largest crowdfunding campaign on record.\nExpansion\nNow Buterin, Wood and Wilcke could yet again focus on development. They did this after setting up another legal entity, ETH DEV, whose purpose was exclusively to direct and oversee the process of Ethereum development. To keep the momentum, and the community\u2019s engagement at an ever-high level, they went on to release several improved Proof-of-Concept versions of the software. Frequent posts on the official blog kept the interests up.\nAt about the same time, major communities dedicated to Ethereum, such as its subreddit, \u00a0started to rapidly grow. Soon, the ecosystem became large enough to warrant a meetup.\nFirst conference\nDEVCON-0, the first event dedicated solely to Ethereum, was conducted by ETH DEV in Berlin, in November 2014. There, Ethereum developers from all over the world met to discuss the matters of the network\u2019s security and scalability, which resulted in several crucial updates to the software. Ethereum\u2019s security and resilience was, and still is, paramount to the developers. They went to great lengths to ensure this despite it leading to some people considering the project vaporware.\nOne of the measures to ensure security, besides the usual inspection of program code, was randomized fuzz testing, which is conducted \u2018in a blackbox,\u2019 i.e. without human-code interaction.\nInstead, the software is fed random inputs and the testers then scrutinize the outputs for any signs of malfunction.\nIn April 2015, the Foundation announced the DEVgrants program. It was meant to fund the best projects in the Ethereum network. The program was reactivated in January 2016 after a brief pause, and is still available for aspiring developers.\n\nHome stretch", "birthday": "2016-06-22T12:10:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-22 11:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 22}

While the attack was slow to begin with, after Van de Sande donated 100k DAO tokens the attacker subsequently picked up pace with more attackers joining in.\nHe says:\n \u201cSome of the most efficient hackers were able to do up to 30 recursions with up to 200 ether moved in each. It became clear that if we didn\u2019t do anything the DAO would be drained before anything could have been done.\u201d \nAfter the Robin Hood team touched base with some contacts known as \u2018whales\u2019, they were able to secure six million DAO tokens, enabling them to outpace the attacker.\nThe address used by the Ethereum developers in the Child DAO Robin Hood attack can be found\u00a0here where it has amassed over seven million ethers, worth over $100m.\nFunds from The DAO have also been sent\u00a0here, but it\u2019s unclear whether it\u2019s involved with the alleged attack or with the Ethereum developer efforts where over $160k worth of ether has been collected.\nAdditionally, a third address\u00a0here from The DAO funds has amassed just under $4 million.", "birthday": "2016-06-22T13:42:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-22 12:42:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 22}

Bringing these significant changes emerging technology raises concerns over the need for some sectors of business, while creating new opportunities for others.\nAgentic Group aims at supporting the ideas, companies, and people who develop and monetize the emerging \u2018Internet of Value\u2019 through exploring real-world use cases for the Blockchain and digital currencies It provides executive education and insight for private fund managers, and develops solutions for corporations, governments and nonprofit organisations.\nRik Willard explains:\n \u201cThe Agentic Group was formed in response to the need for a cohesive voice in the field that addresses not only the financial implications of digital currencies and Blockchain technology, but also the significant ramifications for the rest of the global business community as well as the development of new forms of social benefit in both developed and developing markets.\u201d \nWhy France?\nExpanding the business into France is not a random business decision, and the presence in Paris is important for Consortium. According to Willard, France has some far-reaching and long-standing relationships which align with Agentic\u2019s focus on certain emerging markets.\nWillard sees the high potential for France to thrive in the sector:\n \u201cFrench companies are eager to learn about this new technology and how they can use it for growth. We are looking forward to filling an education and execution vacuum for them, and helping their position in this sector rise.\u201d \nOpening the office in Paris is the first step in Consortium\u2019s expansion plans across Europe, and the rest of the world. The consortium is taking on a mission to provide insight into these disruptive technologies on a global scale.\nChristophe de Courson, Co-Founder and Managing Director of Agentic France considers Agentic France as a timely extension of the movement created by the Agentic Group to support the global Blockchain and digital currency ecosystem through the exploration, education and execution of major projects.\nBuilding bridges from France\nThe main priority for the team in France, as mentioned by Rik Willard, will be working closely with companies, organizations and entities within the country. He sees them playing a pivotal role for the Agentic Group within neighboring countries where they have a cultural influence.\nWillard explains:\n \u201cWe intend to leverage our consortium members to create solutions for French multinationals and we are still determining the scope of their responsibilities and what is feasible in both the short and long term.\u201d \nAgentic\u2019s discussion forum\nThe Agentic Group unveils the nature and trajectory of the development of digital currencies and Blockchain technology through a series of events featuring prominent figures in the Blockchain and financial technology arena, bringing them together for a discussion.\nThe first Paris event took place on June 20 and gathered the most influential players in the Blockchain space. The former French Minister of State Jean-Luis Borloo gave the opening address where he educated all attendees on the important role Blockchains have in his major energy initiative in Africa. \u00a0Former CEO of Maestro and global ATM network Cirrus Ann Camarillo; CEO of Stratumn\u00a0Richard Caetano; Founder of BitWage\u00a0Jonathan Chester, and Founder and CEO of Fermat Luis Molina were noticed among panellists.\nWillard tells Cointelegraph:\n \u201cThe event was a huge success. Our overall goal was to introduce ourselves and mark our presence in France.

The event, which led to up 3\u00a0million Ether being lost to attackers, has had a very negative impact on Ethereum - the most popular Blockchain-as-a-Service platform so far.\nNxt\u2019s new Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) framework will allow anyone - from individual users, to fintech startups, to large corporations - to easily build their own Nxt 2.0 child blockchains with different features and tunable parameters.\nThe main goal for the developers seems to not be to deliver the ability to build anything on a Blockchain (like Ethereum does via smart contracts), but rather focus on perfecting particular meaningful use cases.\nThose solutions will then be able to be plugged in on the different child chains, and finely tuned at the users\u2019 discretion.\nWhat is Ardor?\nArdor\u2019s decentralized asset exchange feature will enable the users to trade any assets on any of the child chains, as well as between them. Decentralized voting and governance systems will also be built in, to allow secure and anonymous voting on the Blockchain.\nLike Nxt, Ardor will also support smart, or phased transactions, where several conditions can be set before a transaction can be executed.\nIn order to ensure the high speed and security of the network, all the child chains are connected to the original and already powerful Nxt 1.0 Blockchain.\nOne of the main innovations of Ardor is the idea to separate the transactions that don\u2019t affect security from those that do. The first group will then be moved entirely onto the many child chains.\nThat will allow the original Nxt Blockchain to serve as a supplier of secure, high-speed transactions for all the practical solutions implemented on the 2.0 child chains, ensuring their high scalability.\nBas Wisselink, one of chief representatives of Nxt, says:\n \u201cThe new Ardor design honors many requests from the market.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/london-may-become-independent-city-state-in-wake-of-brexit", "title": " London May Become Independent City-State in Wake of Brexit ", "content": "In the wake of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, there have been calls from many for \u2018Londependence\u2019, the Brexit-esque name for a referendum of London\u2019s membership of the United Kingdom.\nLondoners voted 59.9% to 40.1% to stay in the EU. Cointelegraph investigates the economic impacts of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU and why this extremely radical idea may actually be a potential solution.\nThe pro-Remain metropolitan capital\n\nIn a graphic published by the Telegraph outlining the vote breakdown on the EU referendum by regions, it is plain to see that Scotland, London and Northern Ireland were all in favour of remaining in the European Union.\nWithin hours of the result being published, a petition calling for Sadiq Khan, the new Labour Mayor of London, to \u201cDeclare London independent from the UK and apply to join the EU\u201d emerged on change.org. The petition has already gained just over 60,000 signatures at the time of writing in less than 12 hours.\nThe sentiment felt by many Londoners was aptly expressed by petition supporter, John Gowers, who lives in Bath:\n \u201cOne\u00a0pound in every five earned by Londoners is used to fund the rest of the UK. In a typical year, London contributes \u00a310 to \u00a320 billion to the rest of the UK and receives nothing in return. Even though the Houses of Parliament are situated in London, Londoners are only able to elect around 11% of MPs in the commons; Londoners have *no say* in how the vast majority of MPs are elected, yet they are still subject to their laws. London has *no control* over its borders while it remains a member of the UK. Since 2007, there have been more people coming into London from the UK than there have from the rest of the world combined. An independent London would be able to impose an Australian-style points-based immigration system at its border, if that were not such a terrible idea. Even better, it would be eligible to apply to join the EU and the Schengen Area, allowing free movement into London from the EU and helping to facilitate the diversity of which Londoners are so proud.\u00a0 Of course, by far the best argument for London independence is the economic one. As part of a post-exit United Kingdom, London faces economic instability and the cessation of trade deals with the EU. As an independent city-state and the newest EU member, London could reassert its status as one of the financial capitals of the world.\u201d \n\nOr as another supporter, Paul Trynka, more succinctly put it:\n \u201cI don't want our kids to be dragged down by old people who've spent all their money and sabotaged their future.\u201d \n      \n\nDemographic data published by the Financial Times will only serve to reinforce a notion that the majority of Londoners already believed, that less educated people in poorer regions of the country who in fact benefit from the EU the most, despite not being European travellers themselves, have caused Britain to leave the EU simply because they outnumber those in London who are often too young to vote.\n\nHowever, it is also important to note that, as is always with global voting trends, despite younger people voting overwhelmingly for remain, they voted in far fewer numbers than those of older generations, and as such some blame must lie with young people for their seeming indolence, and by the same token, apathy.\nEconomic impact of Brexit\n\u201cIn the short term, the vote to leave the European Union is going to commence a period of disruption and uncertainty in which foreign direct investment in the UK takes a temporary pause while investors wait to find out what the long-term situation will look like.\u201d This was the view expressed by the vast majority on both the Leave and Remain sides, as outlined by Matthew Yglesias in his article for Vox.\nHowever, while pro-Leave would argue that this will only be temporary, and \u2018once the world realises that nothing much has changed\u2019, any market changes will revert to their pre-Brexit levels, pro-Remain argued that this period of economic downturn could last for many years, even decades.\nCapital Economics, a London-based economic research consultancy, said of the economic impact:\n \u201cThe outcome clearly creates considerable short-term uncertainty which is likely to weigh on the UK economy in the coming quarters. Nonetheless, we maintain the view that the ultimate damage will be rather smaller than some of the more pessimistic projections have suggested. After all, the UK will remain inside the EU for at least two years and possibly longer.\u201d \nBritain\u2019s beneficial relationship with the EU\nHowever, I would contend that although Britain may eventually recover from this ensuing economic strife, in 50 years time, had we never left the EU, we would be in a better position financially, and the facts tend to agree with me. In an article published by the Financial Times, the truly horrific economic impact on Britain is outlined in a series of graphics.\n\nPrior to Britain\u2019s joining of the EU in 1973, it was widely regarded to be the \u201csick man of Europe\u201d, with its annual growth in prosperity lagging behind other major European powers, such as France, Germany, and Italy in the G7 list of leading economies. However, within 43 years, after its joining of the European Economic Community, it had risen from the bottom of the list to the top.\nAlthough it is incredibly important not to confuse correlation with causation, with many pro-Leaver economists arguing that the absolute growth rates were lower after 1973 than before and that the main reason for Britain\u2019s improved performance was Margaret Thatcher\u2019s reforms, not EU membership, it demonstrates that the EU is not a hinderance to the development of the British economy, by any means.\nIn addition, in the most detailed assessment to date, Britain\u2019s leading economic historian, Professor Nick Crafts of Warwick University, estimates that the EU directly raised UK prosperity by about 10%, largely due to increased competition and better access to the single European market.\nAlthough it is true that Britain did make net contributions to the EU budget of \u00a38.5bn in 2015, amounting to about \u00a3163 million a week, Britain still receives large contributions from the EU to farmers, poorer regions and science. The pro-Leave campaign has repeatedly said that this money saved could be spent as Britain wished, with suggestions that it could go into funding the NHS.\n\nIn reality, this net contribution is roughly only \u00a31 out of every \u00a3100 the British government spends every year, so any savings would be rather negligible. Furthermore, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent economic research organisation, has pointed out that leaving the EU would lead to slower economic growth, and as such the net savings would be wiped out through lower tax revenues and higher benefits spending, even if the growth reduction was as low as 0.6%, a rather conservative estimate. As if this wasn\u2019t enough, the unavoidable collapse of the pound would further wipe savings. The IFS estimates that leaving the EU would cost UK taxpayers between \u00a320bn and \u00a340bn per year.\nThe Canadian investment bank and financial services provider, TD Securities, said of the economic downturn:\n \u201cWe see the odds of a UK recession within the next 12 months as now 60 per cent. We pencil in year-end targets for GBPUSD of 1.20 and 0.50 per cent lows in 10-year gilts, and shift the next Fed hike to June 2017, with a 30 per cent chance of a rate cut but only if downside risks materialise, with these forecasts remaining fluid.\u201d \nAnalysts at the Swiss global financial services company, UBS, added:\n \u201cAnticipation of further QE, intense domestic safe-haven demand, and lower nominal growth expectations are likely to compress Gilt yields, more than offsetting any upward pressure on yields from possible negative ratings action, higher government borrowing, and a drop in overseas investor demand. Sterling has already fallen in response to the Leave vote, we have estimated previously that in the near-term it could trade to the 0.84-0.89 range. From a longer term perspective, we think sterling could head towards parity against the euro and 1.20 against the US dollar.\u201d \nTo conclude, I will let this graphic speak for itself about how world economists\u2019 believe Britain\u2019s exit from the EU will impact Britain\u2019s economy long-term. Given that London is the financial hub of the UK and generates approximately 22% of the UK's GDP, a British economic downturn will impact London the most, and as such an independent London could provide a solution.\n\nImpact on cryptocurrency\nObviously, as Cointelegraph has discussed in previous articles, Britain\u2019s exit from the EU will lead to, and has already led to, a surge in the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as disillusioned Brits flock to more steadfast stores of value than the collapsing pound. Although for the majority, more traditional stores of value such as gold bullion will serve this purpose.\nHowever, for those looking to profit off of this swift Bitcoin price surge, it would be wise to consider the fact its speed could very well be attributed to a fear-based reaction from the British public. The price increase will likely last only a few weeks, if not days, as the pound begins to recover from its lowest level since 1985 while panic trading peters out and tensions subside.\nScotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, and the collapse of the EU\nAlthough somewhat unrelated to the topic of this article, I felt I had to mention the referendum results of Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales, and how they might impact a London exit from the UK. Since Scotland will undoubtedly be holding a second referendum on their membership of the UK, and this time, they will most likely leave, this will pave the way for the breakup of the UK, and as such, an independent London.", "birthday": "2016-06-25T11:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-25 10:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 25}

The dollar\u2019s trend has reached its minimal long-term targets. The choice of a new long-term direction is underway as a result.\nWill the growth continue?\nEthereum\u2019s upward trend has ended with a powerful drop. Disrupting the structure of its trend at the level of $19, Ethereum\u2019s price was not able to hold there, for a continued upward movement. The $19 mark was responsible for the structure of the entire upward trend which started at $14. That\u2019s why a turn to decline at that point was able to provoke such a fall. The probability of the upward movement continuing from that mark was 50/50, but after the turn has formed, the downward movement became more probable.\n\nLitecoin is still forming an upward trend. Several price rebounds from an important resistance of $4.6 indicate that the bulls are holding the advantage. That\u2019s why the odds are on the side of an upward trend.\n\nDASHBTC is forming a deeper long-term downward correction. The reason for that downward movement is a cancellation of a medium-term flat and, naturally, the continuation of the upward Bitcoin trend.\n\nThe dollar situation is really vague. World currencies have not been forming any kind of a clear trend since the beginning of the week. That means that the dollar is in a flat.\n\nThe reason for that flat is that the movement has reached its minimal long-term correction targets. The movement which started at the beginning of this year by most world currencies is a rebound toward the dollar\u2019s long-term upward trend.\n\nConsequently, if that dollar trend continues, the prices of world currencies are going to drop, relative to the dollar. This will also have an effect on altcoins which are traded for the dollar.\nFuture situation\nIn regards to technical targets, Ethereum\u2019s price has to break through the key level at the intersection point of the accumulated volume and Fibonacci level 50. Until Ethereum\u2019s price passes the $16 mark, the odds will be on the side of a downward trend. If the downward structure is not disrupted, the movement will have enough potential to reach $7. If the trend\u2019s structure remains intact and there are no signs of a turn to growth on world currencies, the chances of a downward movement will be higher than 50%.\n", "birthday": "2016-06-20T11:50:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-20 10:50:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 20}

The story progresses rapidly due to the use of smart policies contracts in real life.\nA live interview between Andreas M. Antonopoulos and two well-known lawyers, Brian Klein and Pamela Morgan, as well as Taylor Gerring, a Blockchain Consulting Expert for Ethereum, discussed this revelation.\nOn Twitter, the hashtag #ltbdao saw many asking questions about the situation that arose following the publishing of a letter from the attacker to the Ethereum and Dao community.\nIn it, the attacker claims that he has done everything \u201cby the book\u201d and has also given free Bitcoins to simple miners of Ethereum. He refutes the accusations brought by the community, purporting himself to be some kind of Robin Hood-esque figure.\nAntonopoulos asked about the intersection of law and the DAO in the wake of the DAMN proposal. Morgan, as a founder and expert in the field of justice, has said that all this is a great experiment, for everyone, developers, lawyers and even went on to say that what happened is a good thing for the future of DAO and other similar platforms.\nAll the discussion cannot be considered as legal advice for now or for the future.\nThe contract is the code, where does that lead us?\nMorgan said that since there is a contract, then we have a law called \u201cequitable remedies\u201d, which are implemented in Common Law. In this way, a judge could also take into consideration other parameters. Andreas also explained the contract, how the code was written, what it's purpose was, and what we see as a result of its execution. That's the Dao exploitation.\nMorgan said that in legal terms, the DAO is a \u201cgeneral partnership\u201d, and the jurisdiction lays on the state that the \u201cgeneral partnership\u201d has occurred. This could bring another argument from a DAO holder: what if the contract could not be applied in another state?\n\u201cGeneral partners\u201d have full liability between them, but should also have loyalty. The DAO holders should also have a choice of law and a choice of venue, in order to apply Terms and Conditions.\nTaylor Gerring, a blockchain expert for Ethereum, has expressed his worries about the amount of money the DAO raised so quickly.\nThe letter that the attacker sent was also discussed by Morgan and Gerring. Both believe the letter shows that the attacker is a legally \u201csavvy\u201d person.\nBrian Klein said that the decisions should be based on common logic by the legal community, since it involves them.\nA lot of proposals in the Ethereum and DAO community have alread created their own solutions, from hard forks, soft forks, and even a blacklist of the attacker. The obvious outcome is that a lot people have lost a lot of money and this situation should be taken seriously for the future of smart contracts.\nWho should supervise the codes of contracts?\nAnother discussion has arisen on the topic of who should have the responsibility of supervising the codes of contracts and take reprecaution of them. View the full discussion here.\nChristopher Franko, a Blockchain expert and Lead Developer at Expanse, was asked to share his opinion on this situation.\nHe says that the code did allow for this behaviour to happen, according to the DAO\u2019s own legal contract.

Insurance provider John Hancock, in collaboration with ConsenSys Enterprise, began working on proof of concept using Blockchain and BlockApps.\nCarrying the nontraditional approach to risk management Allianz Risk Transfer and Nephila Capital Limited announced that they have successfully piloted the application of Blockchain smart contract technology for transacting a natural catastrophe swap.\nCompany\u2019s pilot is one of several tests applications of Allianz\u2019s Disruptive Technologies division. It has demonstrated that Blockchain-based contracts could significantly accelerate and simplify transactional processing and settlement between insurers and investors, and increase tradability of cat bonds. It undoubtedly sets the direction for exploration of more opportunities to apply this technology to other insurance transactions.\nWhat are the \u2018cat\u2019 swaps?\nCatastrophe or \u2018cat\u2019 swaps and bonds are financial instruments which transfer a specific set of risks (e.g. natural disaster risks) from an insurer to investors or other insurers utilizing triggers with defined parameters. Generally, \u2018cat\u2019 bonds follow an approach similar to financial \u2018cat\u2019 swaps, meaning that if the event occurs and meets the predefined trigger criteria, the third-party is responsible for the pre-agreed financial risk.\n\u2018Cat\u2019 bonds, however, involve multiple parties assuming the catastrophe exposure through a securitized financial instrument in which they invest. What happens when a qualifying cat event occurs? They lose all or part of the principal they have invested. What if the event does not occur? They win and receive interest in the form of a periodic \u2018coupon\u2019 payment in addition to the return of their principal investment at the bond\u2019s maturity.\nNow what\u2019s there for the Blockchain?\nThe processing of payments between insurers and investors can take weeks or even months after the event has occurred. Smart contracts based on Blockchain technology are believed to facilitate and accelerate the contract management process. How exactly would it work? Each validated contract on the opened shared infrastructure contains data and self-executable codes inherent to that contract. If, and when, the triggering event occurs, and if it meets the agreed conditions, the Blockchain smart contract picks up the predefined data sources of all participants and then automatically activates and determines payouts to or from the contract parties.", "birthday": "2016-06-20T14:55:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-20 13:55:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 20}

Their success in the Blockchain, IoT, and decentralized platform industry have been the foundation for their successful cryptography projects and companies.\nLisk can dominate its crypto sector\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph about this development, Nerayoff says that he regularly gets asked to advise companies and to speak at industry events, but his criteria for attaching himself to companies are clear. \u00a0\nNerayoff explains:\n \u201cI'm very selective on who I attach my name to in an official capacity. I focus my efforts on companies I believe will dominate their portion of the crypto sector. As I saw early on with Ethereum, I see it again in a complementary way with Lisk and it\u2019s enormous market opportunity.\u201d \u00a0 \nHe also tells Cointelegraph that to accomplish the vision of Lisk requires a lot of smart people working there and a group of seasoned advisors which is the reason why he recruited such friends and industry luminaries as Charles Hoskinson and others. On his role, Nerayoff tells Cointelegraph that he will be advising the Lisk team in the art of building a company that lasts. Being part of Ethereum from the early days, together with his experience as an investor as well as the time spent founding companies, Nerayoff is confident of his acquired perspective.\nHe says:\n \u201cI will advise the team on the pitfalls and opportunities they will face in building a successful cryptocurrency and Blockchain app platform. This market by itself is enormous at $77 billion and growing. Further they are positioned very well to help solve the scalability issue which virtually all platforms are facing today.\u201d \nNerayoff believes that Lisk will become the go-to platform for Blockchain applications and services, yet supporting various technologies like Ethereum and others as services for Lisk's own Blockchain applications written in JavaScript. \u00a0\nLisk can become more elegant and faster than Ethereum\nIn an interview with Cryptocurrency investors Tai Zen and Leon Fu, Hoskinson recognised Lisk as a developing technology, identifying the potential of Lisk to do trusted execution of codes even in more elegant and faster ways than Ethereum, but says the technology must be modified to achieve such.\nOne major property of Lisk that Hoskinson identifies is the capacity of Lisk to become a decentralised marketplace for app developers to purchase services which will augment existing apps or develop new ones. Another aspect is that other applications can be run, not necessarily as a side-chain but as delegates where there are stakeholders on the mainchain who elect the delegates.\nHoskinson argues:\n \u201cThere is no reason why Lisk cannot grow like Ethereum, but it has to be earned. The good news is that the creators of Lisk have a lot of runway to achieve this. Max has a lot of humility and he listens, that\u2019s a plus. He has to open up.

Running masternodes can be trying at times,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cThe software (daemon) can crash so you need to make sure there is a way to bring it back without getting dropped from the network. Then there is the hardware.\u201d\nNode40 claims that its primary function is to ease the barrier for anybody who wants to participate in supporting P2P networks like Dash.\n \u201cNode40 had to build custom monitoring software for the hardware,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cIf a hardware issue is detected, we need to insure the node is migrated before its standing with the network is compromised.\u201d \nThe system is being constantly tweaked to ensure a continued passive revenue stream. \u201cIf a node goes offline, the customer\u2019s revenue stream is broken,\u201d explained Woodin and Ryan.\nChallenge 2: New York, a tough state to do business in\nThe Founders claim that operating in New York has also sharpened the company\u2019s nose for compliance.\n\u201cNew York is a tough state to do business in. The regulatory climate isn\u2019t particularly friendly to startups in the Blockchain environment,\u201d says Woodin. \u201cOperating in New York makes us a stronger company because it forces us to focus on compliance,\u201d notes Ryan.\nChallenge 3: Customers and their little knowledge of Blockchain technology\nA key challenge, explains Ryan, is education:\n \u201cWe are seeing more customers who have interest in incentivized Blockchains, but are fresh to Blockchain technology. The on-ramp for new people is still quite steep so we find Node40 playing a big role in education.\u201d \nRemoving barriers to entry is pivotal and a crucial part of the Node40 model. Contributing to this is the company\u2019s recent adoption of a Telegram chat bot.\nRyan says:\n \u201cIt has already been a big help. Sometimes existing or potential customers are hesitant to reach out via phone or email. The Telegram bot offers a secure communications platform for people who have questions and want to chat with a real human being.\u201d \nThe bot directs all inquiries to someone at Node40.\nChallenge 4: Keeping up with software updates\nBeing a key part of the Dash masternode network, Ryan and Woodin contend that keeping up with updates with the cryptocurrency can also be difficult.", "birthday": "2016-06-15T14:20:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-15 13:20:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 15}

At the moment Blockchain technology is getting more acceptance by the majority of discussants, as the potential for financial and non-financial sectors of the market is getting more recognition.\u201d \nExplore it, not ban it!\nThe situation with digital currencies, however, is different. For the last few months a lot of opinions concerning the future of digital currencies in the country have been expressed, ranging from the call to research it to the intention to ban it, as it harms the country\u2019s financial system.\nHowever, at the international conference \u201cDigital currency in the light of current legal and economic challenges\u201d that took place in Moscow earlier this month, discussants raised an important concern about a total ban on digital currencies. Everyone agreed that if digital currencies were banned, the country\u2019s financial sector would fail to benefit from Blockchain technology.\nKoltsov says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cAs far as we know, participants of the conference came to an agreement that digital currencies should be studied, not banned. The Head of the Duma\u2019s\u00a0interdepartmental working group for risk assessment of cryptocurrencies, Elina Sidorenko suggested application of digital currencies as a universal payment tool.\u201d \nRussian state authorities have repeatedly expressed their intention to ban digital currencies and introduce criminal responsibility for any operations with bitcoin.\nIn May, the Ministry of Finance submitted a draft law about the ban of cryptocurrencies, its mining and any operations with it to the Ministry of Justice. The latter, however, has expressed disagreement with the text of the draft law, and a number of definitions, particularly with what is considered to be \u2018quasi-money\u2019. State authorities opposing the very idea of digital currencies often use this term when referring to Bitcoin.\nWhen the first version of the draft law was submitted by the Ministry of Finance, authorities from the Ministry of Justice had expressed concern about the need to introduce such harsh conditions for the use of Bitcoin such as imprisonment and extensive fines, as the level of harm posed by digital currencies is questionable.\nRussian businesses want to \u201cbefriend\u201d the Blockchain\nRussian businesses are developing their relationship with the Blockchain quite rapidly.\nKoltsov says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cPossibilities for application of the Blockchain are vast both in financial and non-financial sector. We at Qiwi are testing a new type of payments processing based on Blockchain technology.\u201d \nThe establishment of a consortium of banks is a step which would undoubtedly accelerate the development of standards for application of Blockchain technology. Reportedly, Qiwi has sent invitations to Russian biggest banks, including B&N Bank, Alfa Bank, and the country\u2019s largest bank - Sberbank.\nHowever, it is still unclear what other institutions could be invited to join the consortium, what would be the main strategy, and how communication and cooperation would be organized. Whether the consortium would get support from the state is also yet to be seen.\nLegal aspects", "birthday": "2016-06-16T15:35:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-16 14:35:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 16}

Now, many in the Bitcoin community have voiced fears that, with a continued one-megabyte limit, transaction confirmation times and fees will increase to the point where Bitcoin itself is untenable, potentially dooming the cryptocurrency.\nHowever, Steven Zeiler, Software Architect at Zen Software and former software architect for Ripple, holds a different view. He feels that the block size limit is at present a non-issue, and that the Bitcoin economy continues to work relatively seamlessly, with no major threats on the horizon from the one-megabyte limit.\nCointelegraph spoke to Zeiler about why the state of Bitcoin is strong despite block size limit challenges.\nBlock size limit issue\nCointelegraph: Do you view a 1MB block size limit to be an issue?\nSteven Zeiler: I spend Bitcoin nearly every day for regular purchases, using a variety of wallets, services and exchanges, and in my experience the payment network is functioning exceptionally well. Yes, a cap on the block size will eventually raise the fees per, but I'm confident transaction verification won't be too poorly affected, since most merchants don't ever wait for a confirmation anyway.\nThe merchants I'm setting up all use BitPay, which seems to have algorithms for confirming transaction validity instantly with a high degree of certainty. The agorists and smaller businesses I deal with who use regular wallets also aren't usually aware of the \"block confirmation\" timescale and simply count the bill as paid when they see the transaction has been broadcast.\nI did have one issue last year because my wallet didn't have adjustable fees and a payment to a Coinbase merchant online was stalled, and I had to deal with customer service, but since then most wallets I use have corrected the problem by offering dynamic fees.\nThough I haven't analyzed the blocks, my hunch is that most blocks have lots of room for transactions with reasonable fees, and we will simply see low-fee transactions crowded out. At the end of the day, with services like Purse.io and Airbitz I can save 5-10% or more on nearly everything I need to live, so a 10 or 25 cent transaction fee doesn't even register as important to consider in my mind.\nConfirmation times\nCT: Do you think higher transaction volume will ever make confirmation times an actual issue? Weeklong-plus confirmations, for example.\nSZ: Everything being equal, more Bitcoin payments might lead to higher confirmation times, but the trend I see is wallets and payment processors researching and implementing technology to increase confidence. The market for wallets is heating up, and the ones with the best confirmation experience and technology will win greater share.\nUltimately confirmation comes down to trust, do you trust the person paying you isn't going to double-spend? If so your confirmation time is equal to the transaction broadcast propagation time, ie almost instantaneous. When shopping locally, I feel a high degree of trust with my neighbors so trust isn't a limiting factor. Chances are that if a transaction makes it into the mempool, it is going to become part of the blockchain.\nCT: You mentioned increased fees not being an issue because of discounts from using Bitcoin. What about with merchants that offer no discount?\nSZ: For me, the transaction fee is the cost of doing business, and currently that cost is extremely low. For example I bought two water bottles the other day at Bikram Yoga Portsmouth with Bitcoin, and paid a fee of ten cents on five dollars. That's still only 2%, whereas credit cards would be higher. But if I was paying my monthly dues of $100 the fee would still be only ten cents, only 0.1% of the bill much lower than credit cards. Though fees aren't a pain, one we are experiencing is lack of a recurring billing protocol for Bitcoin, which would help our yoga studio save money.", "birthday": "2016-06-18T17:05:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-18 16:05:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 18}

Parity was the first to do it and Gavin Wood has been working tirelessly to make this all right. I estimate a few days or a week.\u201d \nThe Ethereum community is running to a tight deadline following one of the biggest hacks in the digital currency space. A recursive call bug was exploited to appropriate 3.6 million ethereum, sending the price crashing down by almost 50% for Ethereum and almost 70% for the DAO.\nVitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, proposed a soft fork to freeze the DAO to be followed by a hardfork to send all the funds to a new contract address where token holders can withdraw their balance.\nGreen states:\n \u201cThe hard fork would fix this completely without affecting the rest of the ecosystem, the Ethereum blockchain chain is structured differently then Bitcoin's; we do not have to undo unrelated transactions. Since no ETH that the DAO received ever exited the system of DAOs that were created (a genius security precaution by Christoph Jentzsch) the DAO Token Holders would be able to get back their stolen funds without affecting the rest of the ecosystem one iota.\u201d \nOpinion is split on the fork proposal, with 52% of 600 polled\u00a0Cointelegraph readers stating they in favour and 48% against. To sway opinion, the alleged DAO attacker has stated that he will offer miners one million ether through a smart contract to oppose the fork.\nHowever, the majority of ethereans seem resolute in backing Buterin and the wider etherean development community in what will most likely be a defining moment for Ethereum and an event that will shape its future.\nGriff Green Fails to Take Responsibility in Full Interview Transcript\nThe following interview took part yesterday with Griff Green, a spokesman for Slock.it, the team that founded the DAO. Any modifications are only cosmetic.\nAndrew Quentson (AQ): Hi, any update? Have you/eth devs entered into any negotiations with the hacker?\nGriff Green: Nope.\u00a0Philisophically I believe all criminals were victims first and we (Slock.it) are looking for solutions. Not more victims.\nAQ: What sort of offer would you make them?\nGG: I'm not personally open to negotiations because with a hard fork we can get all of the ETH back to the people who were attacked.\nAQ: I've emailed some pool operators, not sure if or when they'll respond. Do they back the fork?\nGG: I am privy to some of their discussions and they for the most part are taking a calm analytical approach. They very much back the soft fork and will talk about the hard fork over the next week.\nAQ: They willing to go on record?\nGG: I doubt it.\u00a0But I think there is a general consensus in the Ethereum community that a soft fork is easy.\nAQ: Any time estimate for the soft fork upgrade?\nGG: The code is written and being tested as we speak for multiple clients including the geth client which is the one used by 85% of the miners (or more). Parity was the first to do it and Gavin Wood has been working tirelessly to make this all right.\u00a0I estimate a few days or a week.\u00a0The Ethereum community has banded together to make this happen.\u00a0After that the hard fork discussion will continue.\nAQ: You taking any action to protect the remaining ether?\nGG: Our security guys, Lefteris and Colm are working with some Curators and community members to make sure that if the DAO starts leaking funds again they will be recoverable, but in the interest of security for their operation that's all I can say.\u00a0Sorry I'm on a train going thru the German countryside my wifi come in and out\nAQ: No worries.\u00a0This was just published, a lot to take in I'm sure, but once you read it, what are your comments on it?", "birthday": "2016-06-19T14:05:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-19 13:05:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 19}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/psd2-to-accelerate-digital-revolution", "title": " PSD2 to Accelerate Digital Revolution, Blockchain Adoption ", "content": "Aiming at accelerating innovation and developing a unified payment services sector, the European Commission has adopted the Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which is expected to bring vital changes.\nWhat is PSD2?\nLately, regulators have been increasingly focussing on ensuring consumer protection, competition, and security in the area of financial services.\nThe PSD2 is a data and technology-driven directive, which was introduced as a way to respond to the changes in the landscape of payment services since the introduction of the original directive in 2007, and to drive further improvements in payment services across Europe.\nThe revised version includes a number of changes and enhancements to the original paper, with the main goal of providing clarity, efficiency and ease-of-use of European payment services.\nEnsuring access, liability and transparency\nThe directive significantly extends the scope of the original PSD regulations beyond Europe and revises the definition of a \u2018Payment Institution.\u2019\nOther features of the reform package include: new rules on access to payment accounts, liability allocation provisions, transparency requirements and customer authentication measures.\nThe clauses included in the directive reflect the growing number of account aggregators - businesses that enable customers to access different online banking accounts including credit cards, current and savings accounts using a single online portal, and other fintech companies starting in the payments services sector.\nAccording to the directive, under the new regime, businesses which provide and maintain customer\u2019s payment accounts are required to give certain third parties which have a license to provide payment services access to customers' account information, providing the customer has given their explicit consent to that access.\nThe right of customers to be provided with information which properly informs them about the extent of their access is also extended.\nWhat is there in the new regulation?\nUnder the new regulation, payment services are banned from placing restrictions on third-party account information access. In addition, payment services are prohibited from treating payments which go through third-parties differently (e.g. applying added charges, treating them as being of lower priority, etc.) from those which come directly from customers.\nSeparate provisions have been included to cover payments made under framework contracts which provide for a series of payment transactions and those which do not.\nNow both the payer and payee in a transaction are entitled to receive information from their respective payment service providers about the charges applied to transactions. EU countries are also required to ensure payment service users are given information on any charges or interest applied.\nBefore each transaction, under a framework contract payment service, providers are required to provide customers with explicit information on the maximum execution time and the charges payable by the payer and, where applicable, a breakdown of the amounts of any charges. \u00a0\nStrong customer authentication required\nThe directive contains significant restrictions of rules on payment service user authentication, with the purpose of ensuring that payment service providers \u00a0can be confident that the people using their services are who they say they are. Therefore, payment service providers are required to apply strong customer authentication when payers initiate an electronic payment transaction.\nThe proposals, however, would allow the European Banking Authority (EBA) the scope to set guidelines on exemptions to this general rule.\nGiven that security measures are becoming more and more complex and sophisticated, and that they are constantly driving towards a frictionless experience for consumers, some conflict between the direction that industry and regulators wish to travel in is expected.\nIt is still unclear if, or to what extent, consumers will benefit from the mandated security procedures given that the liability provisions largely protect consumers from loss. Payment service providers who fail to apply strong customer authentication for payments made online or over the phone cannot require payers to bear any financial consequences unless those payers themselves act fraudulently. In all circumstances where strong customer authentication is required, the Council said payment service providers must adopt specific security requirements to protect the confidentiality and the integrity of the payment service users\u2019 personalised security credentials.\nGolden opportunity to accelerate the digital revolution\nThe financial sector is one of the most complicated and highly regulated, therefore it might be hard for many to greet the introduction of new rules with open arms. At first sight it might seem that regulators have made the rules of the game stricter and forcibly unveiled the backstage of payment services scene. On the other hand, PSD2 certainly expands the space for development for financial institutions, once they embrace adopted regulations and revise their growth strategies.", "birthday": "2016-06-09T11:30:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-09 10:30:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 9}

He loves Bitcoin, and in 2014 he predicted that the price per Bitcoin would hit $10,000 USD by 2018.\nWe met with Draper at Nordic startup event Arctic15 in Helsinki (where he was invited as a key speaker) to learn whether he was still as optimistic and enthusiastic about Bitcoin as he was back in 2014.\n \u201cThere were plenty of opportunities to be depressed\u201d, admits Draper. \u201cWhen I bought Bitcoin, it was at this price and then it came down. I was thinking, \u201cwell, they just don\u2019t get it yet\u201d. But now they start to really get it.\u201d \nThe future of Bitcoin looks bright\nIn 2014, Tim Draper bought a huge stash of Bitcoin auctioned by the government after seizing black market site Silk Road. On June 20 this year, Australia will auction $11.49 million worth of Bitcoins confiscated after the arrest of an Australian also involved in the Silk Road, and Draper says he might be interested. \u201cI may do it\u201d, he confirms, \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot and I will be back to it\u201d.\nAccording to Draper, Bitcoin is interesting because some really interesting things can happen with it.\nHe explains to Cointelegraph why Bitcoin is so good in his opinion:\n \u201cI think it is particularly good as an option value as more options happen in Bitcoin. It is good for stored value. I think the most interesting thing will be when people need to pay out dividends and you can just push one button and shoot out Bitcoin into a bunch of different wallets. Or you need to pay a royalty out like the Star Wars guys, just push one button, pick everybody\u2019s Bitcoin wallet and go\u201d. \nHe believes Bitcoin to be the dominant digital currency. Draper understands that some other coins can be more efficient but Bitcoin is a standard currency now:\n \u201cJust like http wasn\u2019t the best technology it was still the best among others because everybody was using it. And if I had some other form of digital currency I wouldn\u2019t really know whether I could trade it for fiat currency. But I know that with Bitcoin I can.\u201d \nOf course, there will be other currencies beyond Bitcoin that are the future of money, Draper explains, but it is hard for him to imagine that we are going to have a bunch of fiat currencies out there in 10 years:\n \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be all virtual currency. Probably, most of it is going to be Bitcoin and then there will be people around who\u2019ll say \u201cI have this coin and that coin\u201d but mostly it\u2019s going to be Bitcoin.\u201d \n\nBlockchain as the perfect bureaucrat - paying basic income in Bitcoin?\nUniversal basic income has become a hot topic in the last few months as Swiss voters reject by a wide margin a proposal to have it granted to all citizens. Finnish and Dutch pilots are set for 2017.\n\"For centuries this has been considered a utopia, but today it has not only become possible, but indispensable,\" Ralph Kundig, one of the lead campaigners and president of the Swiss chapter of the Basic Income Earth Network, said.\nTim Draper goes even further by making this utopia even more utopian - he suggests paying the basic income in Bitcoin:\n \u201cSome governments are starting to talk about basic income for everyone. And they can easily do it by giving everyone a Bitcoin wallet. Every week or every two weeks you could give them their basic income.\u201d \nOr is it really that utopian? Daniel Straub, the initiative\u2019s co-founder, argues that a basic income would free people up to do important work that is currently not incentivised by markets, such as care and climate change research. It could also lead to higher wages for unloved and low-paid \u201cdirty work\u201d.\nAccording to Draper, Blockchain technology could help make this plan a reality:\n \u201cBlockchain is the perfect bureaucrat, it\u2019s the perfect government official. It\u2019s incorruptible, it\u2019s fair, it\u2019s honest. It just gets the job done. It\u2019s the most efficient thing ever.\u201d \nBlockchain is changing everything\nBlockchain adoption is not something that is about to happen, it is rather something that is changing a lot of things in our lives already now.\nDraper explains:\n \u201cThis is an interesting technology changing the industry. \u00a0It\u2019s changing banking, it\u2019s changing government, it\u2019s changing investment banking, it\u2019s changing remittances, loans - it\u2019s changing everything.\u201d \nHowever, governments are still very cautious about it and haven't been rushing to adopt it straight away. Speaking about the reasons for their doubts, Draper notes that the same thing happened to Bitcoin:\n \u201cThey were afraid of it so they tried to come up with all sort of things that were wrong with it. Then they realized, \u201chey, this is really interesting, we can actually use this technology and do some interesting things. Oh but it\u2019s not Bitcoin, it\u2019s Blockchain\u201d. But it\u2019s the same thing. This is a great technology, a great currency, it\u2019s going make all of our lives so much better.\u201d \nThe son of Tim Draper, Adam Draper, runs Boost VC, the first institutional fund to commit to funding blockchain companies, and he is a Bitcoin accelerator. He owns pieces of over 50 companies in Bitcoin from 20+ different countries.\n \u201cWe are more excited than ever about the blockchain and supporting passionate entrepreneurs looking to change the status quo,\u201d it says on the Boost VC website. Tim Draper confirms that he and his son really believe in Bitcoin and Blockchain as \u201cthis is going to be a great change of the world.\u201d \nWith more liquidity, you have a richer society\nDraper thinks that friction creates the difference between poverty and riches. \u201cIf you have friction in your government, in your currency, your people are poorer because there is no liquidity\u201d, he explains.\nHe clarifies his idea by giving an example:", "birthday": "2016-06-10T11:33:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-10 10:33:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 10}

I'm not even sure where I first saw the word Bitcoin, but it was obvious something big was about to happen.\nSoon I was reading every white paper and watching every video I could find. John Lindsay was working on the technical side of the house. A mutual friend noticed we were both interested in Bitcoin, we were introduced, and we began exploring what was happening.\nExcited about Bitcoin\nThere were many digital currency exchanges, standalone wallets, and payment processors trying to build bridges from the virtual to the real world.\nRather than trying to build a better solution in these crowded spaces, we set out to find an area where Bitcoin was a natural fit, but that was completely unfilled.\nIt was John who looked into payroll processing and found it to be a completely green field. After a bit of experimentation during our alpha release in July of 2014, we released our payroll individual solution in November of 2014, which enabled anyone to receive their wages without their employers needing to sign up to our system.\u00a0 With this new solution our company, Bitwage, quickly became the largest Bitcoin enabled payroll processor.\nSpeculators, anti-bank idealists and the unbanked\nWhy would anyone choose to put any of their income in Bitcoin, short of having a specific Bitcoin-only purchase in mind? The initial group of people using Bitwage fell into one of three categories, speculators, anti-bank idealists and the unbanked.\u00a0\nThe speculators seemed to be financiall- savvy working investors. They were looking for a high risk, high reward alternative to their 401ks and they were routing a portion of each check into Bitcoin, treating it as part of the volatile slice of their overall monthly investment pie.\u00a0 The investors would stay because of how much easier it was to receive a paycheck through us.\nThe anti-bank idealists wanted a way to live free from banks.\u00a0 From their perspective, the best way to vote against the banks was not with a checkmark on a ballot, but instead removing the lifeblood of a bank, which is its capital.\u00a0 By receiving a paycheck directly in Bitcoin, these users could completely remove their reliance on the banking structure.\nThe unbanked in the US, albeit a smaller group of Bitwage users than the previous two, had the most to gain.\u00a0 Most unbanked workers have to go to the cash checking industries, which have average fees of 4.11%. Receiving wages through Bitcoin would simultaneously help these workers save a great deal while making it safer and easier to save money.\u00a0 Unfortunately, for these workers, the educational and trust barriers are a lot harder to overcome, and thus not as many were using the system.\nBitcoin leverage\nWhile all of this was happening in the US, countries all over the world, such as Brazil and the Philippines, were full of people working for companies in the U.S. or western Europe, and when they discovered Bitwage, things really took off.\u00a0 It turns out that banks there are loved even less than they are here.", "birthday": "2016-06-11T09:52:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-11 08:52:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 11}

After their IT department spent countless hours trying to find a solution to the attack, it was resolved that they would pay the ransom money of CAD $20,000 (USD $15,780) in Bitcoin to the attackers.\nLinda Dalgetty, the university\u2019s vice president, \u00a0says:\n \u201cThe university is now in the process of assessing and evaluating the decryption keys. The actual process of decryption is time-consuming and must be performed with care. It is important to note that decryption keys do not automatically restore all systems or guarantee the recovery of all data.\u201d \nThe university also reported that there was no indication that \u201cany personal or other university data was released to the public\u201d. However, local police were still informed, and are investigating.\n\nRecent spate of ransomware payouts\nThe attack and subsequent payout by the University of Calgary comes after the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center was attacked in February, and paid USD $17,000 to restore system access, while the Melrose Police Department in Massachusetts paid USD $450 in the same month.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Dr Steven Murdoch from University College London, said of paying the ransom money:\n \u201cIt\u2019s very tempting for organisations to pay out the ransom because that might be the only way they can get their data back, but that makes it worse for everyone else because it encourages more people to set up schemes like the one used in the Calgary case. It would be better if nobody ever paid, although that\u2019s unrealistic to expect.\u201d \nHe added:\n \u201cWhat\u2019s making matters worse is a new trend. The hackers are threatening to publicly publish information they found on your computers if you refuse to pay, which acts as a double incentive to comply.\u201d \nAlso speaking to the BBC earlier in the week, Raj Samani, European technology head for Intel Security, said of the ransomware \u2018epidemic\u2019, \u201cRansomware and crypto malware are rising at an alarming rate and show no signs of stopping.\u201d The BBC also reported that \u201cother researchers reported seeing a 3,500% increase in the criminal use of net infrastructure that helps run ransomware campaigns.\u201d\nUK firms preparing ransom money\nA recent cyber-security survey by remote access developer Citric found that of the 250 companies of various sizes that were surveyed, 33% of the IT and cyber-security specialists representing them said they were buying Bitcoin in anticipation of ransomware attacks.", "birthday": "2016-06-11T14:20:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-11 13:20:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 11}

Who will be responsible for any financial losses?\nCointelegraph spoke to key speakers John Jegutanis and George Papageorgiou at the 2nd Athens Summit - The Evolution of Commerce and the Digital Finance Forum 2016 about Blockchain and its contribution to the evolution of commerce.\nAdoption of Blockchain and Bitcoin in Cyprus and Greece\nJohn Jegutanis, Founder of Coinomi, caused a sensation with his speech at the 2nd Athens Summit - The Evolution of Commerce conference.\nHe gave a presentation about digital wallets and their principal codification (BIP32/BIP39/BIP44), since it is compatible with Coinomi and other wallets, after their analysis technology of transaction sequence where the chain created \u201cblockchain\u201d.\nJohn Jegutanis: There was the risk of the public to lose interest if more delve into technical details, such as proof-of-work of Bitcoin. Although the Bitcoin and his blockchain has pulled the attention because of his continuity from 2009 and significant price increase against the traditional currencies.The questions I received focused on the important issue of the legal framework and what might happen if there will be a problem in the cryptocurrency software. In the end who will be responsible of any financial loss.\nCT: The Greek government will inevitably attempt to pass parliamentary bills concerning the incorporation of digital payments systems. Can we expect similar bills for cryptocurrences?\nJJ: Mostly the economic model of cryptocurrency works backwards from the traditional way. The user controls the private keys of the his wallet. This is a headache for the credibility of the banking system, because it is easy for the user to lose money through carelessness or malicious programs, so we conclude that we need more education for the ordinary user in cryptocurrency. If it is to legislate the issue of cryptocurrency, it will have to do with the identification information (Know Your Customer - KYC), which will involve the exchange and the companies that manage the conversion of cryptocurrency to traditional currencies and remittances to them. Simple wallets like Bitcoin Core, Coinomi, Mycelium, Trezor, and others where the user has 100% control of the private key will be very difficult to control.\nCT: Would it be more wise to follow the example of Japan in the regulatory sector, or will we have to wait for the EU parliament in September to pass a bill for all EU members?\nJJ: Surely there must be some future movement, but requires the separation of service, it depends where you will have the money as a user, even in the exchange, but again if you want to submit account freeze, will do perhaps only at the exchange not possible to happen in personal wallet of the mobile or the computer of each user.\nCT: Do you think there is a real danger of account freezing of digital credit cards bearing the Visa or MasterCard brand?\nJJ: Yes there is such a risk, but only for the part of the conversion of cryptocurrency to traditional currency, as happened in Cyprus and Greece, any cryptocurrency will not be lowered. This is the main reason that makes banks to worry, because in the long term will remain outside of the game, if all citizens understand the power and ease enables the use of digital currency. This is a road that will be followed by banks with the use of technology to create their own digital chain system (Blockchain).

Cointelegraph spoke with the company\u2019s CEO Bobby Lee about their current projects and his vision of the company\u2019s future.\nLeader in China Bitcoin Ecosystem\nBTCC\u00a0was originally founded in China in 2011. In a period of five years it has succeeded in occupying a leading role in every segment of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Let\u2019s take a quick look at how the steel was tempered.\nIn 2013, two years after being established, the company raised $5 million in Series A funding from Lightspeed China Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners, which made BTCC the first among Bitcoin Exchanges to acquire venture capital investment. In April 2014 BTCC introduced the first Bitcoin ATMs in China and a few months later it launched its own Bitcoin mining pool. In April 2016 BTCC announced that the mining pool was to be made available internationally.\nSuch a rapid expansion has allowed BTCC to become a Bitcoin company with the widest range of services to offer. The diversity of services and products provided by BTCC allows its customers from more than 100 countries to engage in all aspects of the digital currency spectrum in one integrated platform.\nBobby Lee said to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cWe are proud to have come such a long way. But looking at it today, it seems such a short distance in the larger scale of things. We are also proud to have extended the property from offering exchange services to payment processing, wallet services, mining pool, and Blockchain engraving. We are the first Bitcoin exchange in China and will continue to expand globally, improving our services.\u201d \n\nLaunch of Physical Bitcoins\nTo celebrate its fifth anniversary BTCC introduced a set of physical Bitcoins struck in pure titanium. The reverse side of each Five Bitcoin coin is inscribed with the words \u2018FIVE\u2019 in 21 major languages. The inscriptions are bound by a solid round line symbolizing the universality of Bitcoin.\nBobby Lee explained:\n \u201cWe made the Five Bitcoin coin to honor the trust and support that our customers have shown us over the past five years. We are now the longest-running Bitcoin exchange, and our longevity reflects the unwavering confidence people worldwide place in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\u201d \nBTCC\u2019s COO, Samson Mow said:\n \u201cThe BTCC brand is now synonymous with global excellence in the provision of Bitcoin services. The Five Bitcoin reflects BTCC\u2019s position as the most trustworthy Bitcoin company.\u201d \nAll Roads Lead to Asia\nDiscussing the company\u2019s biggest achievements and challenges on the way to success, Cointelegraph was also interested in knowing more about the overall climate within the Bitcoin ecosystem in China. Apparently, the interest in Bitcoin is expanding and even though the acceptance of Bitcoin as a form of payment is still limited, there are numerous possibilities for it in terms of payments, investments and the exploration of other use-cases.\nThere is an opinion that Asia is by far the best place to set up a business within fintech, including the Bitcoin business. The relative simplicity of getting funding for a project and the friendliness of the regulatory framework certainly accelerates the establishment and development of businesses.\nBobby Lee shared his perspective with Cointelegraph:", "birthday": "2016-06-11T13:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-11 12:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 11}
{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-blockchain-startup-challenges-case-of-wirex", "title": " Bitcoin Blockchain Startup Challenges: Case of Wirex ", "content": "Wirex is a 1.5-year old company that has weathered many challenges to get to where we are today: a hybrid personal finance platform combining cryptocurrency and fiat currencies with hundreds of thousands of users.\nNavigating yourself in uncharted territories is not easy. This is true for many things - from the literal, geographical sense, to the world of Bitcoin and blockchain startups.\nSome of our challenges are predictable, experienced by every other startup out there. Others are wholly unique to this industry. In this piece, we would like to talk about the problems and challenges we face as a Bitcoin and blockchain startup.\nOur business model\nBefore we dive into the challenges we face, we have to share a little bit about what we do for some background context. Basically, we offer cloud-based banking accounts that anyone can open with just internet connectivity. Our hybrid banking is a combination of one secure Bitcoin wallet and up to three stable fiat accounts - one each in US Dollar, British Pounds, and Euro.\nThis is in fact quite a big deal, and we are very proud that we are able to offer not one, but up to four currency accounts. The hybrid system of cryptocurrency and fiat currencies works amazingly well together. Think of it like a great marriage, where each party becomes the better versions of themselves. \u00a0The Bitcoin wallet allows instant peer-to-peer funds transfers (or in other words, remittances without third parties) while the fiat accounts are also debit cards with payment processor giants Visa and Mastercard.\nWe imagined the possibilities early on and what this meant for some of our customers - including the 2 billion people who are underbanked and unbanked. We imagined their happiness at finally being catered for after being neglected by traditional financial institutions for so long. We imagined greater financial freedom afforded to people who are constrained by the limitations of existing financial services. We imagined millions of dollars saved in banking-related expenses, directly and indirectly bettering the lives of people everywhere. With this ideal in mind, our goal is to make the accounts as easy as possible to open.\nTough task: opening our own bank account\nIronically, this was our first problem. Before we can offer banking to the masses, we had to have our own bank account to begin with, for legitimate business reasons. It was tough for Wirex to open one as not many banks were keen to have Bitcoin-related businesses as their customers. As a startup in an industry riddled with uncertainty (regulatory-wise), it was hard to convince a bank to take us on. There is too much grey area in Bitcoin regulations (or lack thereof), which is off-putting for banks, where clearly defined black and white is preferred.\nChallenges in getting funding\nAlmost every startup will face funding issues - we expected the usual hustle to attract and convince investors on our business model. However, the investors (in Europe, at least) are more interested in other well-known and understandable sectors, not a new sector built from a new digital currency that is barely 8 years old. Investors also prefer straightforward business models with higher entrance barriers with lower competition, that are fully scalable and with protected IP.\nStartup teams should have experts in different sectors, who also have relevant experiences and sound track records with successful exits. Obviously, there is a very limited number of startups that would meet all these requirements. Therefore, for all others, funding largely depends on luck, connections and presentation skills.\nThe perfect team\nAs any startup will know, the team composition is crucial during the early stages. A new startup often does not have enough resources to employ many people for the different roles required, so every team member should be able to fill each others\u2019 gaps when needed. That said, there are specific roles which are indispensable.\nFor example, as a startup in a technology-centric industry that is still shaping itself, we need a tech guru among our founders. This is a non-negotiable element in Bitcoin and blockchain startups. Lacking one will be absolutely disastrous and shows an absence of a long-term sustainability plan.\nAnother role that is an important component is people with entrepreneurial experience. If no one has such experience, it might be difficult to execute the idea into a business. For us, getting the right people with a combination of both entrepreneurial and financial experience was a great advantage.\nResilience in Bitcoin and blockchain startups\nLike other businesses, the first two years are usually very tough. It is always better to be patient and prepared - the slow and steady win the race. Being resilient means that one can take on bumps as they come along and react to it quickly, whether it is in the form of new regulations or outdated applications of the technology.\nResilience also means being prepared to react to new opportunities as they present themselves. Bitcoin and blockchain is a very competitive industry with a great number of tech geniuses constantly trying to outdo one another. The fast-paced nature of this sector means that Bitcoin and blockchain startups cannot afford to be left behind, technologically speaking. If they do, customers are more than willing to move on to the next startup. In the span of Wirex\u2019s (and E-Coin\u2019s) operations, we have seen a number of Bitcoin and blockchain startups fold due to this very reason.\nThe bottom line\nWe believe there will be more challenges set in the future for us beyond what we highlighted above, because this road is currently facing a lot of resistance from traditional financial sectors. Nonetheless, our high growth proves that there is a huge demand for our services, and the basics of any business is to provide a supply for the demand.\nFor us, being in the Bitcoin and blockchain industry is exhilarating. In thousands of instances, we are our customers\u2019 first taste and introduction to Bitcoin. How do we make our core products - highly technical as they are - easy to use and operate for a non-Bitcoin user? How do we get more people to use Bitcoin debit cards, which act as rails towards wider Bitcoin adoption?

It made creating some of the visual communication a breeze.\u201d \nIn a 2014 interview, Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, said after working with several protocols, he had wanted to design a platform that would generalize protocols with their features and allow much freedom without being complicated.\nOptimism related to the brand\nSomething may attract and retain an enthusiast\u2019s association with the platform (or as it applies for those who fall on the other end). This may be linked to the buzz that welcomed Ethereum\u2019s market entry; the platform\u2019s potentials to deliver set objectives based on its present achievements (Ether presently worths $16.50) and/or its perceived promising future outlook. This optimism would be connected to the brand and - particularly - its logo.\nBased on individual preferences, this piece seeks to play on what could possibly be the representation that Ethereum\u2019s enthusiasts would give to the brand every time they come across its octahedron logo - what they identify with as related to the present and future expectations of the platform. Could it be any of the following? Or something else? Or nothing at all?\nUniversally-known shape\nIn\u00a0three-dimensional space, a Platonic solid is a regular, convex polyhedron that is constructed by congruent regular polygonal faces with the same number of faces meeting at each vertex. Five solids meet those criteria, and each is named after its number of faces.\nIn geometry, an octahedron is a polyhedron with eight faces. An octahedron is the three-dimensional case of the more general concept of a cross polytope.", "birthday": "2016-06-14T09:27:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-14 08:27:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 14}

After receiving feedback from DAO supporters, the platform has also decided to build a sidechain from Peerplays to Ethereum.\nAn updated proposal was published a few days ago, offering 20% of the Peerplays earnings to The DAO in exchange for an increased valuation to cover costs associated with developing this sidechain at an accelerated pace. \u00a0Peerplays might become the first startup to get support from $150 million DAO fund. The proposed price is $1.2 million in ETH. The Peerplays 2-tier pre-sale has officially sold out. However, the DAO is still evaluating whether or not to invest in this concept.\n\u201cWe are currently finalizing the DAO proposal for a vote, and the date will be made available shortly,\u201d say the Peerplays team. \u201cIf The DAO approves our proposal we will be building a sidechain from Peerplays to Ethereum which will offer incredible benefits to both ecosystems.

Hence, any negative claim against it generates huge interests. \u00a0\nWhat started the accusations?\nThe lead comment on the thread by Willidungl reads:\n \u201cIt looks like Coinbase may have openly lied about the number bitcoins they store to their users and perhaps even to their investors. They claim that 97% of user funds are stored in multisig addresses. For instance here.\u00a0The CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong published this blog post in which he shamelessly claims that Coinbase is now storing 'about 10% of all bitcoin in circulation'. The issue now is that, as we can see on p2sh.info at the time of this post only around 10% of all Bitcoins were held in p2sh addresses.\u201d \nA query to Coinbase\u2019s press section via email returned with a Twitter link to platform\u2019s official response from Christina Valencia of theoutcastagency.com. She also wrote that Brian Armstrong is responding within the Reddit thread highlighted to her in the previous mail.\nWith the username bdarmstrong, Armstrong wrote:\n \u201cIs all the FUD really necessary?   yes what I wrote in the blog post is true   not all cold storage uses multisig, we also use key splitting as described here   we have done financial audits (which our investors are privy to) which demonstrate proof of reserves   in addition, here is one we did publicly a long time ago   Finally, the most important point is that if you want to store your bitcoin in a way that does not require any trust of Coinbase at all, you can do so on Coinbase with our multi-sig vault! I understand you're upset, but before jumping to conclusions, making outlandish claims, and criticizing me personally, please consider that you may not have full information and there may be a much simpler, reasonable explanation.\u201d \nQuestions upon questions\nHowever the effort does not seem to have addressed what some curious users wanted to know. Willidungl adds that considering the many users of multisig addresses, the percentage of user funds that Coinbase holds in multisig are likely to be far lower than 5% of all bitcoins.\nWillidungl writes:\n \u201cCoinbase additionally has their 'cold storage' which seems to use some version of key splitting (shamir's secret) which would contain funds owned by Coinbase as well as the remaining user funds that are not in the hot wallet. Is it likely that Coinbase's own Bitcoin funds constitute multiple % of all bitcoins in existence? I don't think so. If their 'cold storage' does in fact also use multisig, then their lie would be even greater. So has Brian Armstrong lied to his investors and users? Has he exploited their lack of understanding of Bitcoin to make highly inflated claims? Considering that many other services use multisig and the total number of bitcoins in p2sh addresses is around 12%, something doesn't quite add up. Kraken, OKCoin, Bitstamp, Huobi, Bitfinex, Xapo... they all use multisig afaik. So are you honestly trying to tell us that the funds of all other Bitcoin services and private people that use multisig combined only adds up to 2-3% while Coinbase's funds constitute 10% of all Bitcoins?? Oh the webs we weave... If repeating your claims is FUD then you should contemplate about this. Why not counter the 'FUD' and simply state the exact number of bitcoins Coinbase holds?\" \nThese questions generated more questions about trust issues on the platform as well as other claims of dishonesty.\nshadowrun456 writes in response to Armstrong\u2019s post:", "birthday": "2016-06-04T16:55:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-04 15:55:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 4}

Luckily, Bitcoin can help escape from capital destruction.\nCapital controls are a structure used by governments to restrict, or prevent, the flow of capital out of the country. China, for example, recently tightened regulations on moving money out of the country when faced with a devaluing yuan. Unfortunately, when paired with a penchant for inflating the national currency, capital controls can have a devastating effect on the long-term wealth of the people.\nThe people are forced to use one currency\nIn much of the developed world, legal tender laws exist, establishing a government-sanctioned medium of exchange.\nThis means that for the most part the people are relegated by law to the use of a single currency, their earnings tied to its value, whatever that may be.\nIn a free country, a certain level of global currency competition exists, as citizens have some degree of ability to open accounts in foreign countries and hold other currencies (even though they must still use their country\u2019s currency for economic transactions).\nSome countries such as Iceland\u00a0and China, however, have strict capital controls, restricting the flow of money out of the country. In such countries, citizens are tied to the currency both as a medium of exchange and a store of value.\nThe currency is devalued, devastating life savings\nOnce citizens are forced into one medium of exchange and store of value, they have no choice but to use it regardless of whatever changes it may undergo.\nGovernments profit off of this by inflating the currency as an easy way to generate revenue, without either voting to raise taxes or incurring public debt. This \u201cinvisible tax,\u201d however, still draws funds from the people, as their currency is worth less with each round of inflation.\nThe sad result is that the average citizen\u2019s wealth is slowly starved as they are helpless to escape their fate. They are banned by law from transferring more than a small amount of their wealth into something that does not bleed value as quickly, and must accept and spend their hemorrhaging currency in their day to day business dealings.\nThere exist extralegal solutions for capital flight, but those are not without their risks of fines and imprisonment if caught, and even they may not be an option for the people of a small and insulated nation such as Iceland.", "birthday": "2016-06-05T11:20:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-05 10:20:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 5}

Last year the event gathered 1405 participants, this year the number has grown to more than 1500. The platform has been \u00a0very efficient in helping to establish business connections since the number of business meetings held in Arctic15 has now doubled.\nDmitri Sarle, CEO at Arctic Startup said to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cWe\u2019ve been organizing Arctic15 for a few years now, and every year we aim to advance the event up to the next level, by giving participants an opportunity to meet new people and start collaborations which would eventually lead to business projects.

He is also known for creating a method of viral marketing which has contributed to the successes of Hotmail and Skype.\nDraper has heavily invested in Bitcoin, sharing a belief that one day it might become the pre-eminent store of value for investors.\nDraper has also been interested in European business culture, touring Europe and visiting myriad business events. In 2014, Draper\u2019s Fund, Draper Associates, invested in a Finnish cleantech startup Enevo, and it seems as if his interest in investing in the Land of a Thousand Lakes has grown. He was spotted visiting a Newcomer Bootcamp in Finland which aims to help refugees starting their own business.\n\nEven though there weren\u2019t many fintech companies present at the event compared to previous years, development of the field and latest innovations were among the hot topics discussed at Arctic15.\nLess fintech startups this year\nDimitri Sarle explains to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cEach year the theme of our conference changes depending on trends, however, there is no narrow focus on any specific field. Finland and other Nordic countries are quite confident in developing financial technologies. Klarna, Holvi and PayMe were present at last year\u2019s event, and a few Bitcoin startups participated. This year, however, their numbers decreased, and I honestly don't know why as the government has always shown a loyal attitude towards cryptocurrency startups, and we don't see any pressure from their side. This year fintech startups didn't demonstrate a high interest to participate\u201d. \nNordic countries are quite confident and advanced when it comes to bringing innovations to the field of financial technologies.\nYobie Benjamin from token.io comments:\n \u201cThere is a huge talent pool in Nordic countries when it comes to the development of financial technologies. We are all small countries here which is why we have to think globally from \u00a0day one. I see a huge talent and vast potential here in the Nordics\u201d. \nSeeing some states give space for the development of Blockchain, or, on the contrary, limiting it, inevitably raises the question of where is the perfect place to start a company working around Blockchain?\nSingapore\u2019s paradise\nDusan Stojanovic from\u00a0True Global Ventures says:\n \u201cI think Asia in general, and Singapore in particular is one of the best places as you can start a business within fintech as the regulatory framework is really friendly, plus it is easy to get an idea funded.\u201d \nAn example of this is the Singapore fintech consortium, the largest fintech ecosystem builder, which aims to foster development, interaction and acceleration of the fintech ecosystem in Singapore and South-East Asia. According to Stojanovic, the consortium provides a platform for building synergy among market players, government bodies, financial institutions, corporates, investors and innovators.\nStojanovic explains:\n \u201cThe most amazing thing here about getting funding for a fintech project is that it comes not even from a government side, but from a regulator\u2019s side. It might seem like a dream, but this is reality. Reality, where partners believe that technology can bring added value to the financial industry. This is already a \u00a0good enough reason for all of us to move to Singapore\u201d. \n\nWhere is the potential for fintech?", "birthday": "2016-06-06T10:57:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-06 09:57:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 6}

This has especially been the case in recent weeks after Craig Wright claimed to be the man himself. An oft-overlooked connection between the late computer scientist, Hal Finney, and Dorian Nakamoto, born Satoshi, could hold the answer.\nHal Finney\nHal Finney was a computer scientist and pre-Bitcoin cryptographic pioneer who was reportedly the first person, other than Satoshi Nakamoto, to use Bitcoin\u2019s software, file bug reports, and make improvements. However, an acquaintance and co-blogger of Finney, Robin Hanson, supposed that was \u201cat least\u201d 15% sure that \u201cHal was more involved than he\u2019s said\u201d, though he later redacted these claims when new evidence arose.\nDorian Satoshi Nakamoto\nWhile Forbes journalist, Andy Greenberg, was investigating the identity of Satoshi, it was discovered that a man by the name of Dorian Nakamoto, born Satoshi, was living only a few blocks from Finney. His family home was facing foreclosure by his bank and the retiree was swiftly becoming a victim of the harsh financial climate in the United States.\nWhile Dorian himself was initially investigated as many had suggested that he himself could be Satoshi, these claims were swiftly dismissed when Satoshi vehemently denied his involvement:\n\u201cI have nothing to do with bitcoin. I never worked for the company, I don't know any people there, I never had a contract there or anything like that. I wasn't even aware of the product,\u201d he said.\nThe connection\nReddit user, /u/TaleRecursion, sums up the theory very well:\n \u201cI think he [Dorian] is the real person after whom the Satoshi persona was named.

Cointelegraph speaks to Canadian Bitcoiner Kyle Kemper about the\u00a0Social Wallet, a nonprofit that hopes to digitize every aspect of services.\nKyle Kemper, Social Innovator and Founder, says:\n \u201cSocial payments are a whole new paradigm in finance. Also think about all the sites you use: fold, purse, coinbase, bit gold, kraken, online banking, social media, etc. - ultimately you'll be able to leverage their systems, create accounts, and derive value from them without needing to remember a million different URLs and UN/PW combos. With digital identity plus money, we can reshape logins, checkouts, brick and mortar stores. It\u2019s a concept called seamless experience.\u201d \n\u201cSmart\u201d restaurants without paper receipts\nKyle Kemper: I've worked in restaurants as a server and a bartender. The worst part of the experience is the bill, it ruins nights. In the Social Wallet future, you will be able to go into a restaurant, check-in from your phone, and order from the server or via your phone. They\u2019ll see you in the system, can add things to your bill, and check if you have any allergies, which would automatically notify the kitchen with the order.\nWhen you want to leave, just press pay on your phone, leave a positive or negative review on Yelp, and then the payment is split fairly between the server, the kitchen, the bartender, the restaurant, and the government through tax. There would be no more businesses acting as custodians for tax money, which is a massive headache and liability for businesses.\nPOS/ERP makers would build apps for Social Wallet, so when employees get to work, they clock-in, and at the end of the shift, they get paid. Everything is stored on digital ledgers, making accounting jobs something a script can do. We eliminate paper receipts and the need for printers and clunky dated hardware.\nFull wallet digitalization\nKK: Loyalty cards get kept in your digital wallet and are automatically associated. People can opt-in and get paid/receive discounts to share valuable data with organizations/research firms. Your health records, genome records, driver\u2019s license number, voting tokens, access keys, shoe size, eye prescription, etc. access tokens can all be stored in the wallet.\nThe scope is huge and we can get there pretty fast all things considering. The ability for people to come together and solve gigantic societal problems is available using all the technology at our disposal. We don't need to be together in a physical location, we are where we want to be.\nCentral banks and private banks are going to be moving to crypto in the coming months and years. They will be making their systems digital and interoperable.\nThis will further increase seamless transitioning between systems. I have a paper prepared that advises central banks how to insure themselves and their country's' financial system against bitcoin's rise, but also the fiat collapse. It just has not been the time to release it as it needs to be done the right way.\nSecurity issues\nKK: The app starts as a local bitcoin client and we're building a backend to associate your phone contacts to users. We will not store your keys and we're likely looking at a BIP39 mnemonic as the recovery tool for the v1 release.\nI personally hate mnemonics and we'll work out something better soon. Mnemonics are scary to the average person, and we can't try and change their behaviour because it will hurt adoption.\nAs we grow we'll have more experts providing more input and building security apps, multi-sig, sentinel networks, etc. to make it customizable, redundant, and uber-secure.\nFuture of Bitcoin and funding opportunities", "birthday": "2016-06-03T16:25:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-03 15:25:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 3}

As the block containing less fees would be more beneficial for other miners, the entire network is likely to decide to mine on the less \u2019wealthy\u2019 block.\nA natural equilibrium is eventually reached where miners claim a certain amount of total fees, leaving a backlog. Their selection, however, would not be dependent on the fee rate paid by users, but on the total value waiting in the backlog, thus creating potentially unbounded confirmation times with severe effects on usability.\n \u201cIn order to solve the problem, the backlog must contain a significant volume of value in transaction fees, not just a large number of transactions\u2026 The backlog must also be large enough that it rarely, if ever, empties. This means that users who submit transactions to be published may need to wait for potentially unbounded amounts of time for their transactions to make it into the Blockchain.\u201d \nIncreasing an effective hashrate\nThe study further analyses the Selfish Mining strategy (where a miner does not publish their block until they find another block, thus increasing their effective hashrate) under fees only mining reward and finds that the strategy would be profitable for any miner, regardless of their hash share.\nThe conclusions of the study that the \u2018value to a miner of mining a block changes over the timescale of the block\u2026 in the case of transaction fees and large blocks,\u2019 leading to an increase in orphan rates and lower security or unbounded confirmation times, is likely to have an impact on the on-going blocksize debate.\nChanging value\n \u201cThe value to a miner for mining a block must not change with time\u2026. the assumptions\u2026 that miners have the capability of claiming all possible transactions available in their next block\u2026. does not hold if the block size is small and there is a backlog of transactions.

Combine this with them having the benefit of revenue streams beyond payments and you have formidable competitors.\nSmartphones with smart payments services\nAndroid Pay means more Android platform users for Google; AliPay means more e-commerce sales for Alibaba; Apple Pay means more iPhones are sold, enabling them to reap value from the existing payments value chain and upend pricing models by providing payments services either free or for significantly below-market prices.\nGlobal smartphone penetration by population is expected to exceed 50 percent by 2017 and as more users become accustomed to how they can accommodate a variety of their everyday needs, there will be a shift from the use of bank apps to third party financial service apps by a segment of users.\nIn the United States, 33% of millennials aged between 15 and 33 believe that within the next five years they will not need a bank at all.\nRemember even though Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and AliPay can offer cheaper transactions for the reasons stated above, there is still the Visa, American Express and MasterCard fees which take a chunk out of retailers\u2019 profits.\nThe biggest threat of all to banks profit", "birthday": "2016-06-07T17:10:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-07 16:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 7}

According to his paper \u2018Opportunities and Challenges for Private and Consortium Blockchains\u2019, Ethereum 3.0 with \u2018unlimited\u2019 scalability will be released in late 2018.\nEthereum\u2019s success brought smart contracts in focus\nThe Ethereum platform has generated much furore of late particularly after the crowdfunding of The DAO - or the Decentralized Autonomous Organization - and the subsequent spike in the price of the currency of the platform, Ether, from less than a dollar to $15 in six months.\nA sane level of clarity has also been achieved on the differences between Ethereum and the Bitcoin platform. This understanding, though still sinking, has enabled the two leading cryptocurrency platforms in the world to maintain their operating focus in specialized areas of interest. It also provided enthusiasts a clear view to make the best investment choices. \u00a0\nEthereum has been appreciated more for the popularity it has brought to smart contracts whose programming it\u2019s made a basic tenet of Blockchain's power.\nFuture Ethereum\u2019s milestones\nHowever, despite the rave, the comparison with Bitcoin and the great expectation of the optimistic ETH ecosystem, the Ethereum projects\u2019 currently expected future milestones are still set for between 2017 and 2018, according to Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of Ethereum, in \u00a0his paper \u2018Opportunities and Challenges for Private and Consortium Blockchains released by the R3 Consortium.\u2019\n Metropolis: release of the Mist browser, expected summer/fall 2016 Serenity (\u2018Ethereum 1.5\u2019): release of the proof of stake (Casper) version of the Blockchain, also including Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) 101 and 105. Expected early 2017. WebAssembly release (\u2018Ethereum 1.75\u2019): faster virtual machine. Expected 2017. Ethereum 2.0 (yet unnamed): initial scalability release. Expected late 2017. Ethereum 3.0 (yet unnamed): \u2018unlimited\u2019 scalability release. Expected late 2018. \nIf these milestones are anything to go by, then nothing has yet happened in the ETH ecosystem.\nFrom smartphone of blockchains to the world computer\nAs Buterin says, Ethereum\u2019s vision is to be \u2018the world computer,\u2019 a platform where public economic consensus meets the abstraction power of a stateful Turing-complete virtual machine. It aims to be a platform which enables developers create applications easily benefiting from the decentralization and security properties of Blockchains without the need to create a new Blockchain for each new application. This is unlike previous protocols which are viewed as single function tools, like pocket calculators.\nHe writes:\n \u201c\u2026Ethereum is the smartphone of Blockchains: a universal platform where, whatever you want to build, you can just build it as an \u2018app\u2019 and Ethereum users will be able to benefit from it immediately without downloading any new special software.\u201d \nAll Blockchains have a notion of a history and a notion of a state transition rule, he explains, either which must produce positive answers for any transaction to be considered valid and included in a block. But in Ethereum, the design is somewhat more complicated as the state can be described as the set of all accounts, where each account is either an externally owned account (EOA) or a contract.\nContracts codes stored\nAs an EOA, the state simply stores the account's balance in ether and a sequence number is used to prevent transaction replay attacks. On the other hand, it stores the contract's code and its storage in a key-value database.\n\u201cIn simple terms, rather than enforcing one specific set of rules targeted toward one particular application, Ethereum allows users to write programs specifying whichever rules they want, upload the programs to the Blockchain, and the Blockchain will interpret the rules for them,\u201d he writes.\nThis could possibly explain why the contract mechanism has been used on the public Ethereum Blockchain. It has been used in many ways, including as databases, to keep track of issuer-backed assets, as \u2018smart contracts\u2019 such as financial contracts, escrow and multi-party protocols such as auctions, and as \u2018software libraries.\u2019 \u00a0This allows code to be written and published to the Blockchain once and then used by anyone else.\nQuestions for Buterin", "birthday": "2016-06-08T18:01:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-08 17:01:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 8}

Cointelegraph offers a glimpse into the world of tomorrow of leading consortiums in financial markets.\nRichard G. Brown, a chief technology officer at R3, has explained in a blog post how blockchain technology can be used as a tool for solving problems, what the defining characteristics of a blockchain are, and what in particular makes them interesting for the banks.\nR3\u2019s main role - picking the raisins out of the buns for banks?\nBanks cannot adopt blockchain technology in its current form. Someone must pick the raisins out of the buns for them, so to speak, and that is where R3 steps in.\nAs R3 told Cointelegraph, they are designing and engineering \u201csolutions that meet banking requirements for identity, privacy, security, scalability, interoperability and integration with legacy systems\u201d. R3 has been working on a completely new platform called Corda for managing and synchronizing financial agreements.\nCorda\u2019s main point is in picking the right consensus model for its users \u2013 anyone taking part in the deal can see exactly the same thing as the other one across the Internet but those not involved in the deal, naturally, cannot.\nThere are no third-party validators, no misinterpreting, and no time-wasting. Everyone has the same information and sees what the other does and it\u2019s completely confidential.\nNo wonder banks across the world are thrilled.\nWho is particularly interested in R3 and why?\nAccording to R3, after a successful initial phase of engagement with the banks, the consortium has now entered into the second phase which includes both banks and non-banks. At this point, there are already over 50 members.\nR3 believes that the power of a new technology comes from networking \u2013 and it seems to be true, as the project has been snowballing: the more members join R3 project, the more potential members are attracted to it. R3 provided the necessary kickstart and the meansof growth, but it now looks like the future has started building itself on its own.\nOne of the members of R3, the Spanish bank Santander, has calculated that it could save 20 billion USD by utilizing blockchain technology. How much could other banks save? What could this money be used for?\nCointelegraph examined some of the other members of R3, and found that it was banks specializing in wealth and asset management, along with investments, in particular, that were actively involved themselves.\nWhat is there for non-banks?\nThe R3 trend is also growing amongst insurance companies, as, for instance, Hong Kong-based life insurance group AIA and China-based Ping An Insurance Group joined in.", "birthday": "2016-06-08T12:06:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-08 11:06:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 8}

Are bank branches headed for extinction?\nChanging Face of Banking\nChange is inevitable. Before the invention of ATMs, the teller was an important person at the bank. Now verifying your account balance, counting your money and handing it to you is done by machines.\nMachines do this more quickly, more accurately and at a lower cost compared to your tellers. A similar paradigm shift seems to be happening within bank branches. Increased adoption of internet-banking and mobile-banking have reduced the competitive advantage that an extensive network of branches can provide.\nThe South Korean Example\nBanks are risk averse and typically slower than firms in other sectors when implementing new technology.\nHowever, nothing can stop the march of technology, resulting in changes to how firms across the world, including banks, conduct business.\nAccording to Techcrunch, more than 55% of South Koreans use mobile banking. This has resulted in banks shutting down branches and ATMs.\nGlobal Trend toward Fewer Branches\nThe trend towards lower numbers of bank branches is global. According to Reuters, the number of branches operated by major UK banks has halved in the last 20 years.\nUK banks, including HSBC, RBS and Barclays plan to shut down another 400 branches this year.

It comes in both drink and mix-with-water powder form.\nEssentially, it is a simple, nutritious, and affordable food that possesses nutrients the body needs to be healthy.\nIt allows for a far greater independence in that you can stay healthy by relying on the drink, and also offers serious affordability.\n\nLeap Motion\nLeap Motion could become a disruptive technology in almost every aspect of the creative technological space in the future, from gaming to design and music.\nIt uses a combination of a hardware controller that can be plugged into a computer, or into any VR headset, and software installed on your device to allow you to interact hands-free.\nWhat I find really interesting about Leap Motion is that it represents a true bridging of humans and technology.\nThe problem of identifying a disruptive innovation", "birthday": "2016-06-01T10:30:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-01 09:30:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 1}

Cointelegraph spoke with Kagayaki Kawabata, Business Development Lead at Coincheck.com, to find out how high DAO could rise in the Land of the Rising Sun.\nWhat is DAO all about\nDecentralized Autonomous Organization or DAO, is a project of Stock.It, a German company that has been developing smart-locks based on Ethereum. In a whitepaper released by the company on their website titled \u2018Decentralized Autonomous Organization to Automate Governance,\u2019 the workings of DAO are explained in great detail.\nBasically DAO is a way of using the blockchain to create a venture capital fund. As the paper puts it, \u201cIn exchange for ether, a DAO\u2019s code creates tokens that are assigned to the account of the person who sent the ether.\nThe token grants its holder voting and ownership rights. The number of tokens created is proportional to the amount of ether transferred. Token price varies over time. Token ownership is freely transferable on the Ethereum blockchain, when the Creation Phase has ended.\nThe DAO enters Japan\nAs of May 27, 2016, the DAO crowd sale has collected more than US$ 143 million. We recently learnt that DAO tokens will be supported by Coincheck Japan.\nIn light of this, Cointelegraph spoke with Kagayaki Kawabata (Kaga), Business Development Lead at Coincheck.jp to find out more about DAO in Japan and what his company proposes to do with it.\nCoincheck was the first company to support Ether buying and selling in Japan and it is natural for them to offer DAO related services as well.\nKaga says that there is demand for DAO in Japan:\n \u201cThere were many existing customers that demanded support for The DAO, which prompt us to implement DAO Tokens wallet and buying/selling features.\u201d \nThe Shape of DAO in Japan\nJapan is the 3rd largest economy in the world with a GDP of USD 4.41 trillion. The country has shown a great deal of interest in embracing new fintech like Blockchain and Bitcoin.\nWe have previously covered in detail how new legislation could pave the way for Japan to completely accept digital currency as a legitimate entity.\nHowever when it comes to DAO, the interest is still at a nominal level. We were told by Kaga that the general public only have some knowledge about cryptocurrency but there is interest being shown by big corporations and banks.\nHe says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cIf even one successful project emerges from The DAO, it has tons of potential to attract interest from existing capitals and ordinary people.\u201d \nNew Technology Brings New Concerns\nOf late there have been many voices raised about governance issues surrounding DAO.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/i-love-you-i-hate-you-russia-never-gets-bored-with-blockchain", "title": " I Love You, I Hate You: Russia Never Gets Bored With Blockchain ", "content": "Despite the fact that top-managers of Russian financial institutions have spoken out in favour of Bitcoin and Blockchain, state authorities keep banning the use of all cryptocurrencies, at the same time planning to introduce the country\u2019s own digital currency.\nMaking sense of arguments\nThe Russian state is often seen as highly bureaucratic, inefficient, cumbersome, and unresponsive to the needs of its citizens, as well as potentially limiting freedom of choice. Currently it has been vigorously defending and guarding itself from a bizarre phenomenon, which has nevertheless been widely used globally - a Blockchain technology.\nOpinions on the matter are divided. Sadly, those in power to decide on the future of Blockchain happen to be on the other side of the barricades.\nThe Ministry of Finance and the Investigation Committee of the Russian Federation suggested imposing criminal liability for the use of cryptocurrencies. Earlier last year the authorities were somewhat more tolerant towards technology but today their position is strongly oppositional.\nDmitry Marinichev, the President\u2019s Internet ombudsman, recently expressed his concern about Blockchain and everything related to Blockchain being considered a potential threat. Unsurprisingly, the Russian government is keen to preserve the status quo.\nAt the discussion forum \u201cPerspectives of application and development of Blockchain technologies in Russia\u201d Dmitry Marinichev said that any attempt by the state to intervene in the process of the introduction of Blockchain technologies by businesses and impose a ban on the use of Bitcoin made absolutely no sense. He strongly believes that instead of limiting the use of cryptocurrencies, the government should facilitate both their development and the development of technologies underpinning them.\nMarinichev says on distributed ledger technology:\n \u201cWe will only see a positive effect for businesses if the concept of distributed ledger technology is identified and regulatory framework is introduced\u201d. \n\nRecognized potential of Blockchain\nAnother cluster of institutions is rather open to the changes that Blockchain technology might bring. For instance, the Central Bank of Russia, the main financial regulator, chose to study technology to learn more about \u2018the alien\u2019 coming from the West and then came to a conclusion over its potential for the country\u2019s financial industry. For that purpose it has created a special department.\nThe head of the Central Bank, Elvira Nabiullina said that it is very important to draw a line between the use of Bitcoins and application of Blockchain technology. She strongly believes that the potential for the latter is vast.\nThe largest payment service Qiwi\u00a0and the biggest bank of Russia Sberbank\u00a0are among advocates of Blockchain technology. Thus, earlier this year Qiwi announced the launch of its own digital currency Bitrouble.\nHerman Gref, CEO, Chairman of the Executive Board of Sberbank of Russia, strongly disagrees with the attempts to limit the use of digital currencies in Russia and called on the authorities to stop exaggerating their threats.\nHe says about Bitcoin and Blockchain:\n \u201cMost certainly Bitcoin is not something that should be banned. Blockchain is a new internet. I mean, it is the innovation of the same level and importance as the Internet. What we see now is absolutely unacceptable: technology is only starting to develop into something sound, and our authorities have already said no to it. Then they said we cannot buy cryptocurrencies, now they are saying that those who buy them will be locked up behind the bars. Are you sure this is the right decision to make to ensure advances and progress? I don\u2019t think so. If Blockchain is banned we risk seeing the progress going somewhere else overseas and we risk losing professionals and experts who would leave the country to seek a more friendly environment and legislation.\u201d \nMoreover, Gref is positive about the impact Blockchain technology might have on all industries without exception, He therefore believes that Russia should not miss out on this new revolutionary technology.\n\nBlockchain to revolutionize ideas of how things work\nMany banks understand that introducing Blockchain technology will significantly change the whole system, its logic and mechanisms. The main advantage of Blockchain and cryptocurrencies when compared to traditional currencies is the absence of middlemen.\nToday, all operations with money, documents and data require participation of a \u00a0third party. Banks, state authorities and notaries have to approve the legitimacy of deals. As Blockchain is totally decentralized and controlled by members of the community, it significantly simplifies the procedure and discards the middlemen.\nSimply put, if introduced to everyday life, Blockchain technology will eliminate the need of banks, some of the state authorities, auditors, insurance companies and registers. The technology is able to alter the relationship between the state and its citizens.\nDatabases developed using Blockchain technology might be used to keep not only information about financial transactions and credit obligations, but also about registered marriages and migration registration. No wonder state authorities are opposing the introduction of technology.\nBesides, other concerns of the state officials opposing digital currencies are related to their shady reputation - too many examples of them using Bitcoin for deals with drugs, weapons and other illegal actions. In this instance, the introduction of regulations makes sense, because there might be certain threats behind the use of Bitcoin related to the anonymity of transactions and their transborder and global character.\nThe development of regulatory framework appears to be one of the greatest challenges faced by state authorities. Currently there are no legal restrictions that concern Blockchain technology. However, imposing bans on the use of digital currencies will affect many business processes.\nIt\u2019s about time\nMany experts believe that the current economical situation can facilitate the introduction of new technologies. As with any other innovation, Blockchain causes many debates both nationally and internationally. Both opponents and advocates agree on one thing - Blockchain is one of the most important inventions of the last decade as it is able to revolutionize the financial industry, cyber security and the education industries. Why not start with clearing up a regulatory framework?\nIf Blockchain technology is widely applied by both the Russian and international banks, the country might obtain the chance to get around any sanctions. For instance, the introduction of Blockchain will allow the departure from the international interbank financial telecommunication system SWIFT.\nAt every parliamentary session Russian policy-makers claim that their main priority and aspiration is to ensure the sustainable development of the country in all spheres and to accelerate technological evolution. In practice, however, they are still afraid of innovation and prefer to stick to familiar things, even though they are outdated.\nWhile politicians cannot make up their minds whether to love or hate Bitcoin and Blockchain, users are protesting:", "birthday": "2016-06-02T11:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-02 10:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 2}

If successful, we will enfranchise a significant portion of the global population that was previously disenfranchised and democratize access to the rapidly evolving global financial system.\u201d \nMicrosoft, ConsenSys and Blockstach Labs collaboration\nVenture production studio focused primarily on Ethereum, ConsenSys has announced its partnership with Microsoft and Blockstack Labs to work with developers around the world to create an open-source, self-sovereign, blockchain-based identity system.\nThe announcement claims that the collaboration was solidified at the ID2020 conference, held at the United Nations in New York, where UN members, private companies, and government agencies co-convened to define the problem of identity in the world.\nConsenSys also says to have developed the uPort Identity solution, with integrated support for its reputation system and transactional security system. uPort revolutionizes identity creation and management for potentially 7.4 billion people on the planet. \u00a0\nChristian Lundkvist, lead software architect of uPort, notes:\n \u201cI\u2019m very excited about this collaboration, which promises to radically expand the reach and user base of self-sovereign digital identity systems. With this project we are taking a big step towards empowering people who suffer due to \u00a0the lack of identity, as well as streamlining the fragmented identity systems in our modern society.\u201d \n\nPower to the people\nMore than 2 billion people in the world who don't have state issued ID, can have their community members attest to their personal information.\nCommunity members can essentially vouch for each other to enable them to develop and use this bootstrapped persistent and portable reputation to, for example, obtain a microloan on a decentralized lending platform and grow a small livelihood from there.\nThe tight integration of RepSys, as contained in the announcement, enables people, organizations and objects to attest to the conduct of their counterparties with respect to various kinds of transactions: buying/selling, lending/borrowing/repaying, collaborating on projects, gaming interactions, and data quality and reliability. \u00a0\nuPort serves as a container for reputational attributes like email addresses, Facebook URLs or state issued ID. Identity providers like governments, banks and IT companies can cryptographically sign such attributes attesting to their validity using \"reputational attestations.\" \u00a0\nAll users of uPort are fully in control of their personal information (expressed as reputational attributes). This encrypted information may be selectively and granularly shared with targeted counterparties when the user deems it to his or her advantage.\nRouven Heck, product manager of uPort, states:\n \u201cThe massive increase in the usage of smartphones and the internet, combined with blockchain technology, offers a great opportunity to solve identity issues for everyone. Reliable digital identity and reputation will create trust in the digital world, which will fundamentally change the economy. This collaboration is a great foundation to realize the necessary adoption of these tools, independent of the underlying technologies.\u201d \nThe world began as a decentralised society\nJohann Gevers, in his presentation at TEDx Talks titled \u201cThe four pillars of a decentralized society\u201d explains how the world has moved from Decentralisation, to Centralisation and heading back to Decentralisation in completion of the cycle.\nAlmost everyone in the Tech world agrees to the viability of the Blockchain in solving prevailing world data problems.\nOne major struggle which has become very evident is how to get governments to accept this technology that may consequently strip them of absolute control of certain major societal processes.\n\nTobias Schwarz, Decentralization and Encryption expert, says:\n \u201cI like the idea and the possible disrupt a Blockchain tool could offer. With the cryptographic toolset that the public Blockchain system use, you should have all the necessary functions to implement such a system.\u201d \nBlockchain Entrepreneur & Digital Transformation Manager, Manuela Krull-Mancinelli believes that the role of the Blockchain in this theory is obvious.\nKrull-Mancinelli explains:\n \u201cI think that the private key in time will replace your ID, just like a passport or other ID currently is. The difference is that the passport, drivers license, etc. are issued by a government. Currently there is no official issuing party for private keys.\u201d \nDealing with social challenges\nWhile speaking to Cointelegraph, Thomas McAlister, Director at Mercchain Ltd, says that using the Blockchain to solve the prevalent identity crisis which the world is facing is not only possible, but that his company is already working on a project to achieve that.\nAccording to McAlister, registration in state civil registries guarantees the right to an identity, recognition and enjoyment of the human rights and benefits to which all persons are entitled. A historical situation of discrimination exists against certain vulnerable groups, including stateless persons, indigenous peoples, persons of African descent, persons with disabilities, migrants and the children of persons deprived of their liberty.\nHe explains that there are 200 million under-five-year-olds who have no identity. In the Americas, 1.3 million births go unregistered each year and 6.5 million children do not have a birth certificate. The level of under-registration among children between 1 and 5 years of age fell from 18 per cent to 7 per cent, due mainly to the notable effort of States.\nThese figures should gradually improve, especially since 11 per cent of under-five-year olds in rural areas are still not registered. Under-registration is most prevalent in areas where births do not take place in hospitals. In cases involving children, non-registration implies being exposed to child labour, being arrested or subjected to human trafficking, among other human rights violations.\nMcAlister points out that there is also a problem of inflexible public registration policies, which exclude diversity. Registration systems are often defective owing to a lack of national policies with appropriate legal and information frameworks, institutional flaws and budget constraints. Civil identification registries are good indicators for gauging the efficiency of the State in general and of the relevant authorities in particular.", "birthday": "2016-06-01T14:42:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-01 13:42:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 1}

In addition, for those interested in security, Blockchain encrypts all communications between nodes and wallets using AES-CTR and only allows them to take place after completing authentication.\nThunder is said to relay payments over multiple nodes in the network automatically, using encrypted routing, which basically means that no one knows who made a payment, allowing for more privacy.", "birthday": "2016-06-02T15:55:00+01:00", "date": "2016-06-02 14:55:00", "year": 2016, "month": 6, "day": 2}

Syscoin and OpenBazaar provide similar but different services using very different technologies. Syscoin builds on Bitcoin's blockchain technology while OpenBazaar relies on p2p technology using Bitcoin only for payment. Because OpenBazaar, a privately funded company, doesn't have this foundation in blockchain tech the possibilities and potential for Syscoin are quite different than those of OpenBazaar - ranging from sidechains to new BIP operations and more.

Financial institutions are trying different ways of approaching Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. These technologies could be applied to our financial system by 2020.\nWe are witnessing the development of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies known as alternatives. The path has certain obstacles, and the banking system tries to eliminate any possible dangers.\nWhy Bitcoin cannot be used by financial institutions\nIn 2015 we have seen a many articles regarding the issue of public vs. private blockchain.\nThe main argument as to why Bitcoin could not be used by financial institutions is down to the number transactions which could be done per second. Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain network is only capable of processing about six or seven transactions a second. In contrast, Visa has the capacity to process 65,000 per second.\nThunder, Chain and R3CEV are about to change the game\nBlockchain released another code on 16 May 2016 called\u00a0Thunder which has the potential to facilitate secure, trustless, and instant payments, at a scale of 100,000 transactions per second.\nBitcoin startup company\u00a0Chain on 02 May 2016 announced the\u00a0Chain Open Standard 1 (Chain OS 1), which is an open source blockchain protocol. This will be controlled by financial corporations.\nPreviously efforts have been made by the\u00a0R3CEV, which includes 43 global banks. They have released a distributed ledger system for financial services called\u00a0Corda, aiming to have strong digital identity, as they will pass AML/KYC.\nBlockchain to enhance data systems\nMany companies are trying to win this race, and always we have to remember the reason why Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain is important. It is created by mining procedure, not only by the transactions alone.\nAnother company offers a different path.\u00a0ChainReactor is a new startup company created by a former banking member\u00a0Jon Nelson. He is focused on using Blockchain technology to enhance data systems.\nJon Nelson explains his idea:\n \u201cChainReactor provides node support to all major database platforms, leading blockchain technologies, a decentralized exchange of assets and supports HFT with less than a second block times. ChainReactor can perform a billion transactions per second and can scale higher.\u201d \nIt will be a permissioned distributed ledger for enterprises only, with a strong digital identity, as they will pass AML/KYC. Miners and users have to comply or otherwise the system won\u2019t let them inside.\nHow to avoid problems related to national laws\nAccording to Nelson, a database shard is a horizontal partition of data in a database or search engine. Each individual partition is referred to as a shard or database shard. Each shard is held on a separate database server instance and to spread the load each of the shards becomes a mini blockchain allowing it to use the computing power more efficiently.\nA transaction in the case of cryptographic assets will involve two shards or more and a series of decentralized main reactors provides the core services, as name resolution, exchange, trust and configuration management.\nThe ability to use the Blockchain for what it is - a log of chained transactions in blocks - gives the ability to apply the methods and not keep the data after a certain period if the application requirements are not needed.\nNelson says to Cointelegraph:", "birthday": "2016-05-24T15:30:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-24 14:30:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 24}

In the Bitcoin world it is known that some exchanges don\u2019t charge fees on either side of trades.\nExchanges that manipulate volume of trade\nExchanges which do not charge fees are mostly omitted on the Bitcoin index. This is usually due to the suspicion of the \u201cfaking\u201d of the volumes traded.\nShaun Gilchrist, Founder and CEO at\u00a0BitcoinAverage, explains to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cA lack of fee means technically unlimited trading on a very tiny spread, and the short of this is hugely increased volume.\u201d \nWithout trading fees it\u2019s easy to bloat the volume, whether bots or some person sitting in a room manipulating figures at the push of a button or at the shout of a command, it\u2019s artificial, and noticeably so.

He points out that as far back as 1976, the idea of a CLOB (Consolidated Limited Order Book) was first proposed to the SEC by Professors Mendelson, Williams, Jr and Peake shortly after Congress told the SEC to create a National Market System.\nCorliss says that the idea of a CLOB is based on one very simple premise, \u201cthe best prices are attained when the orders of all potential buyers and sellers have the opportunity to interact\u201d.\nThe absence of such a central order book consisting of both private (limit) and public (market) orders leads to disparate liquidity pools enabling intermarket arbitrage.\nCorliss concludes:\n \u201cWe can debate which option is best, consolidation or competition, but if we ever plan to involve the masses in this activity, including institutional investors and broader society, then we must consider a structure which is fair, else risk others defining this for you.\u201d \nRegardless of one\u2019s opinion, a simple fact which we cannot overlook, says Corliss, is that consumers (not digital ccy traders) always expect pricing parity and thus are not going to bounce around between disparate exchanges to locate the best price.\nConsidering that global lawmakers and regulators primary focus is always \u201cconsumer protection\u201d, Corliss says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cI would strongly suggest that we all think about what this means to each of our businesses. By the way, I know the traditional markets have fought against a CLOB for years, and have won the debate thus far, but the competitive market structure has significant issues which are outside of this question.\u201d ", "birthday": "2016-05-24T14:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-24 13:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 24}

Has quantum computing finally arrived and what impact will it have on Bitcoin?\nQuantum computers\nQuantum computers represent a new paradigm in computing.\nWhile traditional digital computers store data in binary bits (zero or one), quantum computers store data in the form of qubits (where 2 data states can be superimposed.).\nThis enables large scale quantum computers to solve certain mathematical problems in a much more efficient way compared to traditional computers.\nAsymmetric cryptography - the key to Bitcoin\nThe Bitcoin \u00a0protocol uses asymmetric cryptography to ensure that bitcoins can only be spent by their rightful owner. Transactions signed by a private key can be verified using the corresponding public key.\nBrute forcing private keys corresponding to a given public key using currently available computers is infeasible. While bitcoins have been lost by users to hackers, it is mainly due to the unsafe security practices of users.\nHowever, asymmetric cryptography is one of the problems that can be solved efficiently by an effective quantum computer.\nEffective quantum computers not imminent\nThe power of quantum computers increases exponentially with the increase in number of qubits. The processor built by IBM is a 5-qubit processor, which is great to demonstrate the concept of quantum computing.\nThe real power of quantum computing can be unleashed only when the number of qubits increases.\nAccording to The Economist, a 300-qubit quantum computer can have more possible states than the number of atoms in this universe.

Could music artists benefit from this feature? Cointelegraph talked to a number of experts to learn how the music industry could adapt to the rules of the digital age.\nHow Blockchain can help the music industry\nGabe Higgins, Founder of CryptoEdge Solutions and Tampa Bay Bitcoineers, says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cBeing a musician for almost two decades I've experienced the dramatic decline of the music industry in the digital age. When I discovered Bitcoin and learned about Blockchain technology, it immediately struck me as something which could revolutionize the music industry. Artists have been using the Internet to create new business models to sustain music careers but that is getting increasingly difficult too.\u201d \n\nWith the advent of the Blockchain, Higgins can see artists building their fanbase by incentivizing them with a token asset which would gain value as the artists gained popularity. Feedback loops could be built, and many of the intermediaries could be removed, so that both the artists and the fan could benefit, rather than just the record companies. This would also build a stronger network of fans who would be more likely to stay with an artist throughout their career.\nHiggins looks forward to the day when there is a marketplace of artist\u2019s tokens being traded like commodities because that's what music is and should be valued in this way again.\nIntegrity and trust between strangers\n\u201cBlockchain technology is complex, but the idea is simple\u201d, say Don Tapscott and Alex Tapscott in their piece for the Harvard Business Review about the vast, global distributed ledger or database running on millions of devices and open to anyone where information and anything of value \u2013 money, titles, deeds, music, art, scientific discoveries, intellectual property, and even votes \u2013 can be moved and stored securely and privately.\nThey write in the review:\n \u201cOn the blockchain trust is established not by powerful intermediaries like banks, governments and technology companies but through mass collaboration and clever code. Blockchains ensure integrity and trust between strangers.\u201d \n\nTools to simplify licensing and paying loyalties\nAs a decentralized system with no single entity controlling it, the technology is transparent for everyone to see its anonymized data with every transaction automatically time-stamped and with a unique ID. No exchange rates apply either, because cryptocurrencies are oblivious to borders.\nPeerTrack, for example, uses an automated, Peer-to-Peer network specifically tailored for the music industry called MUSE. It is a membership organisation in the cloud specifically serving the music industry\u2019s new ecosystem as a global database for copyrights, a means of payment for all music-related transactions as well as a tool to simplify the licensing of musical works.\nThis provides artists with transparent accounting, automatically separates royalty payments and also has the capability to allow the creation of Notes (tradable VIP passes, perks and privileges) to engage their fan base. It is also a retail store where the content creator sets their own price on all creative works for a 5% administration fee.\nPeerTrack claims a good Apple\u2019s iTunes deal has artists losing 40% for a download.\nJeremy Gardner, Co-founder of the Chairman of the Board Blockchain Education Network, says to Cointelegraph:", "birthday": "2016-05-26T16:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-26 15:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 26}

Variable difficulty, a defining feature of the pool, adapts the difficulty to the power of a user\u2019s CPU/GPU, which allows for efficient mining even on some weaker equipment.\nMinergate was launched in 2014 by a team of cryptocurrency enthusiasts. It consists of more than 100,000 active users mining a number of cryptocurrencies - Monero, Bytecoin, Bitcoin, and now Ethereum.\nThe ins and outs of Ethereum mining\nSolo miners and pools alike have been mining Ethereum since the generation of its Genesis block on 30 July 2015. The ever-growing popularity of the coin has reached an unprecedented height, when it hit $1B market capitalization in March 2016.\nIt is no wonder that there are many people out there who would like to join in on the profits from the nascent industry: the total hashrate of Ethereum network is\u00a0estimated to be 2.4TH/s and growing, with most of that amount spread across\u00a0several major pools.\nAs it was with Bitcoin, the popularity of the cryptocurrency is creating nigh-impregnable barriers to entry for independent non-professional miners.\nEven now, the GeForce GTX 960, one of the most popular GPUs, would have to mine Ethereum for\u00a0about 5 months before it just breaks even, and the difficulty is only expected to increase.\nWhat that means is that the focus will gradually shift towards mining pools, which allow their members to join resources and thus increase the predictability of the gains, as opposed to relying on luck while mining solo.\nMaking mining accessible for amateur miners\nIt is for that reason that the pool\u2019s\u00a0GUI miner has been one of the most simple to use in the industry, with a single-click mining feature.\nThe pool\u2019s developers kept the same idea of accessibility in mind during the implementation of Ethereum mining.\nCointelegraph talked to Claude Lecomte, Minergate`s CEO, about the mining industry and Minergate\u2019s new features.\nAccording to Lecomte, Minergate has a 1-click GUI miner that eliminates the barriers for entering the mining world. Minergate software doesn\u2019t require configuring the system or studying tutorials. The user downloads the app and clicks \u201cstart mining\u201d.\nThis is important as many users don\u2019t know how to deal with console miners, but still potentially have significant mining power. In the case of Ethereum, they are often gamers that usually have powerful graphic cards. \u00a0\nLecomte considers Ethereum \u201cone of the most advanced technologies nowadays.\u201d He considers the secret to its success to be the fact that it isn\u2019t positioned as \u201cmodern cryptocurrency\u201d with some \u201ckiller features\u201d. It is a blockchain platform that allows for creating value added applications on top of it.\nHe explains to Cointelegraph: \u00a0\n \u201cWhile Bitcoin popularity is limited to the Nakamoto\u2019s genial idea of decentralized digital money, Ethereum is open to any other ideas that can be coded, which means there are no limits at all. Having such opportunities, Ethereum can constantly become more popular, and Ethers, being the basic network token, can grow in price infinitely.\u201d \nAlthough Minergate\u2019s Ethereum mining feature is targeted to amateur miners, professional miners can successfully connect and efficiently mine on the pool, using console miners, like ethminer, the official Ethereum mining client.", "birthday": "2016-05-27T14:36:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-27 13:36:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 27}

On the other hand, it predicts that notes and coins will drop to being used for just over one in four (27%) payments by 2025.\nThe report provides an overview of current and future payment behaviour in the UK. It revealed that over 72,000 payments were made every minute in the UK in 2015 by consumers and businesses - totaling more than 38 billion payments. By 2025 this will go up to 79,044 payments every minute (or 42 billion in the year), with increasing card usage playing a major part. 14.5 billion debit card payments are predicted as the most popular payment method by 2021 overtaking the forecast of 13.0 billion cash payments for the first time.", "birthday": "2016-05-26T14:50:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-26 13:50:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 26}

Fresh graduates litter the whole place seeking to be absorbed into a crashing labour market as the business environment presently reflects so much unfriendliness to operators within the sector.\nThe dismal gross domestic products (GDP) and job reports, besides the current high inflation levels (13.7 per cent) clearly show that the government\u2019s economic policies are not effective and require an urgent review to avoid further plunge in economic activities, analysts have warned.\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has released the nation\u2019s economic scorecard for the first quarter of the year \u2013 GDP and Unemployment Reports. The GDP report depicts that the nation\u2019s economy plunged into negative territory with a decline of 0.36 per cent year-on-year (y/y) in real terms. The growth rate is 2.47 per cent and 4.32 per cent lower than what was achieved in the last quarter of 2014 and corresponding period of 2015 respectively. In nominal terms, the total value of the nation\u2019s economy was put at N22.26 trillion in the first three months of the year.\nAssessing the Q1 GDP number, analysts at Eczellon Capital Limited stated that the first quarter figures have set the tone for the nation to enter into an economic recession by the end of the first half of the year as the weaknesses in the non-oil sector (Manufacturing & Financial services) are still inherent.\n\nCross-border opportunities\nThis bleak perspective confronting the Nation\u2019s dominant workforce has seen youths within the country seek greener pastures beyond the borders of Nigeria. Thanks to modern day technology, the world is now a global village. People are not particularly restricted by space and time anymore. Citizens do not need to be physically present to become employees of cross-border companies.\nA factor which plays an important role though is the cost of acquiring value for work inputs. Bank charges and charges from different methods of transfer have left beneficiaries unsatisfied when they know how much they may be losing over a given period of time.\nThe cost of money\nThe president of Bitwage, Jonathan Chester tells Cointelegraph that the average cost of sending a $200 payment to Nigeria from the US is over 5%. According to him, \u00a0for example, with Western Union, an online payment has a 3% hidden exchange rate fee on top of all the other flat fees.\nChester says:\n \u201cI unfortunately do not know the breakdown of high skilled vs low skilled workers who do offshoring work in Nigeria, but I do know that while engineers all have bank accounts, only about 33% of the adult population have bank accounts.\u201d ", "birthday": "2016-05-26T18:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-26 17:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 26}

How Blockchain Will Help Europe ", "content": "Can, in not too distant future, the European Central Bank become a decentralized autonomous organization?\nIn Part 1 of the article \u201cHow the European Parliament Views Blockchain\u201d we looked into how Euro Parliament has taken on cryptocurrencies in its latest report. Here, in Part 2, we continue to analyse it.\nThe European Parliament is looking at cryptocurrencies as a means to conduct transactions faster and cheaper, assuming that cryptocurrencies can help lower borders within the European market.\nDiminishing role of banks\nBut this assessment ignores how Bitcoin redesigns and diminishes the role of banks and central banks. The euro could draw inspiration from Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized approach.\nThe European Parliament, similarly to banks, sees in cryptocurrencies a new technology to run cross border transactions faster and cheaper. Next to this positive outlook a major point of concern, however. is the governance of cryptocurrencies. The \u2018Bitcoin Model\u2019 of a community-driven system with miners, users, developers and merchants deciding on future directions doesn\u2019t seem a satisfactory framework for Europe\u2019s citizens.\nThe report says:\n \u2018\u2026 \u00a0\u00a0Bitcoin ...creates uncertainty and consumer or \u2013 more broadly \u2013 user protection problems, especially in the event of challenges unforeseen by the original software designers.\u2019 \nBeyond central banks\nMany citizens and end users might, on the contrary, find an appealing concept in cryptocurrency being out of the control of banks and central banks. Especially in periods of inflation, cryptocurrencies offer an attractive alternative.\nThroughout the report of the European Parliament, there is little to find onvmacro-economic and monetary aspects of cryptocurrencies. Where it is mentioned clearly there is a concern as it assumes that cryptocurrencies could diminish the role of politics in the financial sector:\n \u2018the potential long-run future limitations on the effectiveness of monetary policy if private VC schemes were to be widely used as a substitute for official fiat currency;\u2019 \nSuch statements suggest, the \u2018old\u2019 way of doing things is after all \u2018quite good\u2019 \u2013 hence worth protecting. For many citizens whom the European Parliament wants to protect, this would not be a statement they necessarily subscribe to.\nEven many euro enthusiasts who look at a common European currency as an attempt to secure peace on a historically war-shattered continent will have doubts that the monetary union is sustainable as it is. And the immediate outcome many fear is that the European central bank will stimulate the economy by printing money, which in the long run will cause more financial bubbles, turmoil on the financial markets and inflation.\nEurope is not as uniform as the US\nThis is a pattern many \u00a0foremost powerful central banks like the U.S. Federation follow.\nThere is, however, an important difference for Europe. The continent is as diverse in mentality and economic strength as few other regions in the world, having independent and often conflicting governmental and financial strategies. \u00a0Yet still, there is one central bank which is responsible for the entire euro zone. The European Central Bank has to strike a balance between southern European countries\u2019 need for stimulating economy and lowering their debt service and northern countries with their concerns with inflation and financial instabilities.\nAs a result, we can \u00a0see entire countries and its populations getting stirred up against each other. Seemingly long overcome, yet lasting, stereotypes of \u2018lazy southern Europeans\u2019 and the puritan hard-working northern countries (or even worse, Germany taking Europe finally, after two lost world wars, onto its currency) are all over the media.\nNotwithstanding the fact that a significant part of the money, which was used to \u2018bail out Greece\u2019, actually goes back to European banks, which handed out loans too easily to southern Europe. How can cryptocurrencies help us in this dilemma?\nDecentralization of the \u00a0European Central Bank\nImagine, we could replace the concept of a central bank deciding on European Currency Policy \u2013 a board which is appointed by legislation but not directly elected - with a version of a decentralized autonomous organization, backed up by the mechanisms of a democracy.\nAt the core of the DAO would be an algorithm, about whose functioning different bodies would need to agree. Such a model would democratize monetary policy in a very direct way. Members of such a DAO would need to be voted in. This is obviously against today\u2019s practice, but with regards to the importance of central banks \u2013 one of the few really powerful European institutions - it\u2019s a logical step. Cryptocurrencies could be grounded much deeper in the principles of democracy than current super national currency policy in Europe allows.\nBitcoin will bring predictability", "birthday": "2016-05-27T16:26:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-27 15:26:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 27}

Either the whole downward movement is a correction toward the trend, which has started at $10, and it will be followed by a rebound and a continuation of the upward trend; or there will be a correction toward the upward trend, which has started at $7, and the minimal target for such a rebound will be around $11 in that case.\n\nLTC/USD\nLitecoin\u2019s price continues to move within a flat. After reaching the top limit of that flat at $4.1, Litecoin could not fortify at it, and rebounded towards the bottom limit at $3.8. If the bears don\u2019t win the advantage, the price will return to the area of $4.1.\n\nAn exit from this flat will indicate that the price is undergoing a \u00a0larger correction. If Litecoin fortifies below $4 and forms a turn to decline, there will be a chance of a larger correction to begin towards the upward trend, which has started at $3. In that case, the minimal target for such a rebound will be around $3.5.", "birthday": "2016-05-23T11:37:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-23 10:37:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 23}

Ever. No pizza chain in my city takes Bitcoin, so my idea was to buy a voucher with Bitcoin from either ZebPay or to credit a payments app called Mobikwik through Unocoin and buy pizza through that. Alas. This was not to be.\nThe\u00a0Zebpay voucher had ran out of validity and\u00a0Unocoin requires a long winded registration process that involves verifying your identification documents that couldn\u2019t be possibly completed, as today is a Sunday.\n      \nIf I have learnt anything it is this that Indian Bitcoin scene has yet to grow from its infancy. Not only does nearly no one accept Bitcoin directly at the counter, even Bitcoin exchanges are not providing transactional services on weekends.\nFurthermore even if I had purchased a voucher, it would not have worked today because\u00a0Domino\u2019s, the only Pizza company that accepts such a voucher is having technical difficulties on their website and would not let me log into my account.

Part 1: Benefits ", "content": "DAO is a new concept which has grabbed imagination, raising a record-breaking $150 million. What can it do?\u00a0What can\u2019t it do?\nWhile the world is just learning about the blockchain and barely getting their heads around Bitcoin or Ethereum, a new concept has grabbed imagination, raising almost $150 million, and shattering all records: The DAO.\nUnlike corporations or companies, the DAO has no CEO, no directors, no board, no employees and no shareholders. It is literally just a few lines of\u00a0open source code. That code, however, allows it to hold money, with no human involvement or control, in an Ethereum address visible to anyone.\nMachine-to-machine\nUnlike normal addresses, which require a private key to spend funds, the\u00a0DAO smart contract address has no private keys. Although machines cannot authenticate individuals without input, machines require no such input from other machines themselves. As they have already authenticated that the DAO address holds more than 11 million, and that a transaction is valid according to the smart contract\u2019s coded rules, no further authentication is required, thus no private keys.\nThe funds, therefore, cannot be lost or stolen and there is no hot wallet to hack. The smart contract address, instead, obeys only the rules of the code making the DAO autonomous in limited ways, such as automatically and perhaps incrementally sending funds or distributing returns on investments.\nA venture fund, kind of\nThe DAO, specifically, can be described as a venture fund. Anyone who wishes can send Ether to the DAO smart contract address and receive a DAO token for the next few days. Once the DAO token \u201ccreation\u201d period is over, entrepreneurs or inventors can put forward a proposal for a project they would like funded.\nThe proposal has two components: a business plan or prospectus for the DAO token holders, and the translation of that business plan into smart contract code. The proposal\u2019s smart contract code is analysed by a panel of Curators to determine whether the code does what the business plan says, whether it is safe and not malicious, and whether the proposing entity is genuine.\nToken holders matter\nOnce authenticity is verified, the proposal is then opened to the DAO token holders who can approve the offer, reject it, or, potentially, suggest modifications and re-submission. A minimum quorum of 20% of all tokens is required for a successful vote to pass. \u00a0\nThe most highly anticipated proposal is from slock.it which has already published a\u00a0whitepaper. According to Griff Green, a spokesman for slock.it, the proposal will not ask for more than \u201c50% of the DAO's ETH holdings\u201d with the actual figure not yet published. At the current ever-increasing rate, that would be no more than $75 million to fund an Ethereum computer, slocks, and a vision of a Universal Sharing Network.\nThat still leaves at least some $75 million, an incredible amount of funds, to be invested in other endeavours, such as a Ledger Ethereum Wallet which is estimated to cost \u201conly\u201d $140,000.", "birthday": "2016-05-18T17:15:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-18 16:15:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 18}

We hear it\u2019s decentralized, autonomous, with no CEOs or directors - but can it actually work?\nHope may turn around\nMany seem to think it will as they send 11 million ethers to the\u00a0DAO smart contract, but there are considerable risks. Voters may not participate, legal uncertainties may give protection to scammers, the crowd may become emotional and irrational, focus may be lost, hope may turn to hate.\nFor one of the most exciting experiments to flourish a new consciousness may need to arise, replacing the current attitude of \u2018speak first, ask questions later\u2019 with \u00a0worklike ethics requiring a shift from mere chatting to a collaborative common endeavour to bring forward shared goals with a focus on creating a\u00a0fourth industrial revolution.\nThis is a futuristic vision of machine to machine payments, with fridges becoming intelligent machines, inanimate matter coming to life through smart contracts. It\u2019s a steep mountain to climb with considerable risks and failure more likely than success. \u00a0\nWill Voters Participate?\nAccording to\u00a0Daniel Larimer, founder of Bitshares, voter participation may be minimal as it requires time and knowledge to analyse proposals. Moreover, approved projects would convert ether into fiat which may affect the price. Holders, therefore, might not approve any project.\nA potential solution is an incremental release, minimizing impact on price and addressing another potential risk: projects absconding. According to Mo Balaa, Systems Engineer at Stratford University and DAO Community Member:\n \u201cKickstarter projects often abscond with funds and there's no recourse. With projects funded by the DAO, funds are held by an intermediary (the proposal contract) and only paid out as milestones are reached (minus some initial funding). It\u2019s like a programmatic voter facilitated way of providing money to someone who promised you something in return for it.\u201d \nThe Wisdom of the Crowd\nHowever, funds released to projects are at risk with further risk added each time funds are released as the project may, at any point, simply give up, burning all the previously invested funds. It is here where the wisdom of the crowd may assist as a diverse array of individuals from different specialisations look at all aspects with a collective decision potentially more informed than a small number of executives.\nOn the downside, the time period for any such decision is only 14 days which may not be sufficient to carry out any due diligence or analysis. Most initial proposals, therefore, may be rejected, which, psychologically, may not be a good start of any relationship.\nWill the Wise Crowd Descend into an Irrational Mob?\nOf more concern may be the behaviour of the crowd. They may be unduly demanding, or not sufficiently demanding. They may make emotional decisions or, at times, turn aggressive. Some, especially if anonymity provides cover, may simply try and gain entertainment by disrupting or trolling.\nKeeping harmonious relations when thousands of individuals are involved may be difficult, if at all possible, but potentially achievable if a laser focus is retained on cool headed financial analysis, but any such coolness may break down at the second batch of funds or midway through the project.\nA professional attitude would need to prevail, with a businesslike laser focus, emphasis on politeness and constructive contribution to keep the risk of the crowd becoming a mob at bay. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nPotential Legal Complications\nBut what happens if, despite the odds, the token holders do give prevalence to rational thought over emotion, do behave politely, do retain a laser focus, and nonetheless a seemingly great project decides, for no apparent reason, to just give up, midway, burning all the invested funds, simply, perhaps, because they can?\nIn established financial relations, you sue them. The DAO, however, is a new invention which doesn\u2019t easily fit with established contractual laws. The smart contract itself can\u2019t act. Perhaps each individual can have legal standing, but that wouldn\u2019t recognize the decentralized, yet collective, nature of the DAO.\nAs this is a consensual and contractual (albeit written in code) civil relationship a legal system which wishes to keep up with innovation may take the view that, since the contract says, at minimum, 20% of token holders control the funds, standing and liability should likewise require that 20%, collectively and in unison, sue or are sued.", "birthday": "2016-05-19T15:35:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-19 14:35:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 19}

Stopping corruption before it happens. In other words, corruption should be fought with logic rather than emotion. \nA new way to fight corruption \nIn 2015 the former President of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan said that corruption could only be fought effectively with instruments of the law and strong institutions: \n \"You don't fight corruption with nerve. You fight it with the instruments of law. You fight it by strengthening institutions. Advanced countries don't use their nerve to fight corruption, it is not presidents or prime ministers who fight corruption in those countries. It is the system. That is why even the prime minister or president can be removed and tried for corruption.

As many worry that mining becomes less profitable, some experts take a different view.\nMost Bitcoin users believe that the pending halving in July will have an effect on the cryptocurrency\u2019s value. Speculations\u00a0are rife that Bitcoin mining activities will be less profitable afterwards especially for big miners which will extend to individuals who have mining contracts. Some say the small miners will also suffer.\nA debate about the topic appeared in a bitcointalk.org discussion thread which has two separate quotes from Genesis Mining. A first post by EBK1000 in response to a miner was the following:\n \"We know the halving will be a topic, but we cannot predict what will happen. We can\u2019t even predict the next difficulty change due to the nature of cryptocurrency and its daily changes. But just one thought, when the mining reward will halve, also the need for BTC will increase due to expanding companies and the value of BTC will increase, and this not on minor numbers. Best regards, Tom,\u00a0Genesis Mining\" \nIn his next post he says:\n \"If all else remains the same then mining would probably not be profitable anymore. But as said, nothing ever stays the same and effects of the (coming) halving are not known. Value can rise or drop, people can stop mining, making difficulty go down, more people could be mining it for value reasons, and so on.\" \nMining worries\n\u201cThis halving is different from the previous because when the first one happened,\u201d says Tim Akinbo, CEO of Nigeria-based TimbaObjects to Cointelegraph, \u201cmost people mining Bitcoins were hobbyists. Today we have people mining as a commercial operation with millions of dollars in investment.\u201d\nHe says that most mining operations are barely profitable now and if the Bitcoin price remains the same when the halving occurs, then a lot of mining operations will become unprofitable.\n \u201cFor them to remain in business,\u201d he adds, \u201cBitcoin's price will have to increase by 100% for the effect to be non-existent. I don't think that's going to happen.\u00a0When you have a barely profitable operation and then you take a 50% cut in revenue, most mining operations will shut down. That will not necessarily make Bitcoin less secure because it will lead to more decentralisation of the mining process.\u201d \nBincoin already priced it\u00a0\nOthers don\u2019t think any loss would be incurred as a result of the halving.\ngkv9 writes:\n \u201cLook, when the price of BTC was $200 and miners were mining, just think why did they mine...\u00a0It was just because mining was profitable with the reward of BTC25 when the price was $200, so if we see it correctly, the price is currently double the previous one, and so it can be said that BTC is already priced in before halving so that miners may actually profit in future too, though they are still accumulating for any further losses which might occur (possible) but I don't think that with this price, you might see any loss even with halved rewards\u2026\u201d \nLower power consumption an answer\nChina\u2019s Bitbank shares the same view. The mining company is confident that the halving will not change the industry\u2019s long-term growth outlook to affect its profit.\nThe Shenzhen-based company is even looking to raise 3500 BTC via crowdfunding to build a new mining factory with a promise of a 100% ROI plus interest for principal investors.\nIts head of international operations Virgilio Lizardo Jr\u00a0tells Cointelegraph that the halving has been factored into the company\u2019s business plan for over a year.", "birthday": "2016-05-21T15:59:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-21 14:59:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 21}

The first thing you would do after unpackaging it is start looking around for things to nail and nail you would: walls, your workbench, walls, boards, and walls. You have a new toy- a new technology- and you want to use it wherever you can justify using it.\nSeven years agoblockchainswere invented as part of Bitcoin. For year one, almost no one knew the project existed. In year two, people learned how to make use of the currency. During year three, people started using a different blockchain,Namecoin, to hold domain name information in a system which was academically interesting but not widely used. Since then people have started trying to hold all kinds of things in blockchains: deeds, contracts, and all sorts of documents. On the outside, it sounds sensible: a censor-proof fully distributed persistent data storage system.\nAn Organization Finds a Fun Power Tool\nLast week DARPA, the U.S. Defense Department\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency, put outa requestfor prototypes for a secure messaging platform. Potential participants are tasked with creation of a platform which uses \u201ca decentralized messaging backbone to allow anyone anywhere the ability to send a secure message or conduct other transactions across multiple channels traceable in a decentralized ledger.\u201d In particular, they want a blockchain. It\u2019s rare that DARPA demonstrates much misunderstanding of new technology but this RFP makes it clear that DARPA has jumped on the \u201cJust use a blockchain!\u201d bandwagon without regard to their huge downsides. DARPA has found a nail gun and by God, it wants to use it.\nThe problem is that blockchains are bad at storing data. They aren\u2019t even intended to be a data storage system- they\u2019re a consensus mechanism and that\u2019s it. A consensus mechanism is a way for a bunch of entities who don\u2019t trust each other to come to a consensus about the order of events. An event may be the transfer of money or the creation of a document. Everything else that DARPA wants, blockchains cannot do. They want a system where \u201cRegulators with access to the ledger [can] read the correspondence and thus easily verify that a transaction didn\u2019t violate Federal Acquisition Regulations,\u201d despite the fact that blockchains will not help with access control nor will they help to guarantee transparency. If officials and contractors don\u2019t want a contract to be stored where regulators will review it, blockchains will not help.\nDARPA wants a system to work such that \u201cTroops on the ground in denied communications environments would have a way to securely communicate back to HQ,\u201d despite the fact that blockchains by themselves aren\u2019t encrypted and do nothing to help you if you have no way to communicate already. Encryption and the other features DARPA wants could certainly be layered on top but then the blockchain only serves one purpose: decentralization. According to the document, decentralization comes with two benefits: security and cost.\nTwo problems: Blockchains don\u2019t secure data and they are very expensive.", "birthday": "2016-05-21T10:43:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-21 09:43:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 21}

But we have to develop, I think, a greater sense of urgency about the questions... about the value chain, whether there\u2019s value, then the distribution of the value. I think we also should ask about the complexity of the copyright system. How easy is it to comply? We have built up a very complex architecture behind the copyright system, with the authors, the publishers, the collecting societies; is there any way of simplifying that? Maybe some of the answers will come through technology. Some people suggest that blockchain, the technology that underlies Bitcoin, may be something that can be applied to mass licensing. Blockchain is a secure chain of title, so you have security between the operatives, between the parties to a transaction \u2013 security in relation to the subject matter of the transaction. That might be a very simplified explanation of the impact of the technology and the possible use it could have. Imogen Heap has released a recording using this.

Sewrjugin believes that SegWit will come to resolve two major problems; transaction malleability and blocksize.\nAccording to him, the problem of malleability is a very old problem and finding a solution to it will boost trust and confidence within the system, and the second would bring an end to the debate and political fight between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic.\nIn addition, Sewrjugin says that it could also support a deeper widespread adoption of Bitcoin technology, fulfilling the promise to take it into the mainstream, as happened with the Internet in the past. So certainly, it opens up new possibilities due to the ease with which new code upgrades can be provided in a seamless manner.\nSewrjugin says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cAnd as we know, technology adoption is fired up by the way it can be deployed and updated on a massive level - think about regular old software being installed on a client vs cloud usage.

He says:\n \u201cIn 2013 I took off on my adventure in the Bitcoin ecosystem following the Bitcoin Meetup in Rome, I have always looked for exciting opportunities. Very early in my life, I promoted and organized electronic music events. Later, I conducted multiple projects producing music. I began to have an interest in cryptocurrencies and started HolyTransaction because it strengthens the underprivileged in a quick, safe and independent way\u2019. \nA multicurrency wallet\nHolyTransaction is a universal wallet which allows users to store, spend, change and manage multiple cryptocurrenties and digital values \u200b\u200bas Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Omni Layer, Dash, Peercoin, Blackcoin, Ethereum, Gridcoin and more. Basically all the currencies based on the blockchain technology. \u00a0\nThe peer-to-peer method enables simple and fast transactions, and enables crypto-to-crypto instant exchanges in a single account.\nFighting competitors\nThe main difference between HolyTransaction and its competitors is that the first one admits not only Bitcoin but also many other cryptocurrencies, so it can be called a \u201cuniversal\u201d wallet. Additionally, HolyTransaction has a fixed-rate exchange. \u00a0\nUsers can switch from one to another cryptocurrencies in their personal account in a few clicks, with a simple interface.\nNormally, if you want to have ten different cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, peercoin, etc.) you need to have ten different wallets, which is difficult to manage. Instead, HolyTransaction platform solves this problem, unifying everything in a single account. It also provides you with a high level of security with crypto-to-crypto exchanges so you can easily turn from one cryptocurrency to another.\n\nAdding Multisignature for improving security\nBitcoin users are quite concerned about their privacy. \u00a0However, there are several ways that the accounts are protected: for example, regular safety inspections and 2-factor authentication: the first is the user name and password, and the second is the verification code you receive on your mobile.\nMoreover, HolyTransaction used the so-called \u201chot & cold storage backups\u201d, but they also decided to incorporate the MultiSignature (MultiSig) to improve the wallet security. MultiSignature gives users multiple access:: a cryptocurrencies wallet has a public key, which is shared; and a private one, which is kept secret.\nTransactions must be signed with the private key of the user to verify his authorship, and to validate the transaction.\nMultiSig requires more than one person to complete a transaction agreement. For example, a wallet Multisignature from seven users may need the validation of three of its members for the transaction. Or if two people open up a MultiSig wallet together (friends, partners etc), this wallet may only send transactions when two people have validated such a move. If not, the transaction cannot perform.\nIn fact, HolyTransaction wants to let people manage their money as they wish.\n\u201cBitcoin exists for that: to allow yourself be your own bank. By incorporating MultiSignature on our platform, we are trying to strengthen the autonomy of people with the right to fully control your money\u201d, explained Francesco Simonetti.\nFragmentation problem", "birthday": "2016-05-18T14:30:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-18 13:30:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 18}

The company launched on 4th July 2001, and allowed users to instantly transfer gold and silver between customer accounts, similar to competing systems such as e-gold and GoldMoney. Between its creation to 2008, e-Bullion gained over one million users, substantial transaction volume, and reserves of approximately 50,000 ounces of gold bullion, now worth $63,615,000.\nThe company\u2019s founders, Jim and Pamela Fayed, had a troubled marriage, and eventually divorced.

At 6:30pm, in broad daylight, on Monday 28th July 2008, Pamela Fayed was stabbed to death in a parking structure at 1875 E. Century Park in Century City, California.

The members of the expedition, held this year from February 26 to March 8, were journalists of the \u201cGovorit i Pokazyvaet\u201d production studio and BitNovosti web-site, who paid all their travel expenses only with cryptocurrency.\nThe tour started and finished in Moscow, and the team drove through Lithuania, Germany, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia, Poland, and Belarus. The farthermost point of the tour was the capital of Netherlands, Amsterdam. The goal of this project was to capture the current state of development of the Bitcoin infrastructure and to make a presentation at the Bitcoin Wednesday conference in Amsterdam. After that, we planned to create a new documentary film based on the travel observations of the team.\n\nJust to remind you that at the end of the last year the first Russian documentary \u201cCryptocurrency: The Gold of the Digital Age\u201d was shown. The film was created by the \u201cGovorit i Pokazyvaet\u201d production studio with the support of the\u00a0HashFlare cloud mining service. And the presentation of the authors of this film at the conference in Amsterdam was dedicated right to the first run of this film.\nIt is not a new idea to travel paying in bitcoins. For example, Felix Weiss has already visited more than 22 countries, only paying in cryptocurrency everywhere. But the European experiment of the film crew and the journalists was also the first of its kind since the events of the tour were meant to be put to the basis of a new film, and the people involved in the world of cryptocurrency who were met by the film crew on their way became the central characters of the film.\nIf we were a bit more fortunate, we could even boast that they drank from our souvenir\u00a0mugs all way long:\nWe were preparing our souvenir items on a very tight schedule because (as it always happens) we got started doing it at the very last moment. We spent a lot of time working with our designer until we found the solution which we were satisfied with. Then we got the print office to print everything for us within one day, and shipped a parcel with mugs, flash drives and T-shirts. But at the last second, it was detained by the customs and failed to be delivered to BitNovosti before the start of the tour. So, the expedition team started their travel having no chance to get the parcel on their way. And now we are waiting for a questionably long time when the parcel will be delivered back to us. We still haven\u2019t received it back, though the expedition has already returned from their European tour. That\u2019s why we can only see our mugs the way you do - on the picture :'-(\nTravel Observations\nWe have contacted Alexander Bezzubtsev, the producer of the \u201cGovorit i Pokazyvaet\u201d production studio, who directly took part in the organization and realization of the Bitcoin Tour, and interviewed him on his feelings and the lessons learned.\nAfter long preparations, a minivan stuffed with equipment and Bitcoin explorers hit the road to Belarus and Lithuania. In Minsk, the Bitcoin team was lucky to meet with the founder and CEO of SoftSwiss (www.softswiss.com) Ivan Montik. His company created the world\u2019s first platform for Bitcoin casinos and brought classic games (slots, roulettes, cards) to the world of Bitcoin.\nSearching for variants of accomodation in Belarus, the journalists and members of the film crew succeeded to find only one advertisement the author of which dared to lease the apartment for bitcoins. Except for a number of Bitcoin companies, including SoftSwiss which works for a foreign market, there is practically no Bitcoin movement in the country, and shortly the film crew moved towards the Belarusian-Lithuanian border.\nAs the members of the Bitcoin expedition told us later, Lithuanian border guards met them with great suspicion as the law requires everyone who enters the EU to have at least 40 Euro in cash per each day of stay, and border guards found the arguments of the journalists that they have e-wallets with bicoins in their pockets quite weak. After a long wait, our team was escorted for interrogation to the watch commander who thoroughly listened about the purpose of their journey, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Wednesday in Amsterdam for half an hour and was finally convinced by the arguments.\nUnlike Belarus, in Lithuania Bitcoin is not a novelty, people know and talk about it. Staff members of some venues, whom the participants of the Bitcoin expedition met, were aware of the possibility to accept payment in cryptocurrency and, in theory, they were ready to make such transaction.\n\nAs it turned out, the owner of the cozy youth hostel was ready to accept even Litecoin. As the members of the expedition noticed, all venues which accepted bitcoins were especially creative. The Bitcoin travelers used the\u00a0map of Bitcoin accepting venues for planning of their trip and land navigation, and according to their impressions this map is accurate for about 70%. In Vilnius, the Bitcoin team visited the barber shop Barzdaskuciai, owner of which likes Bitcoin. So, if you want to shave your beard and pay for it in cryptocurrency, nobody will be surprised there.\n\nThe next country of the Bitcoin tour was Germany. The first stop of the Bitcoin team in Germany was Hannover, where they met with Ricardo Ferret Rivero, the founder of the Pey company, which creates Bitcoin payment terminals and distributes them among city shops and cafes. This year, Pey is planning to launch more than 150 terminals around Hannover. And the participants of this trip informed us that now in Hannover you can quite often see the stickers \u201cBitcoin is accepted here\u201d in hairdresser\u2019s saloons, cafes and small shops.\nThen the Bitcoin expedition moved to Berlin, where they visited the fabulous burger shop Room 77 which hosts the meetings of the Bitcoin community from all over the world.\n\nBy the way, the wifi password in this shop is Allyourcoinsisbelongtous!.. It is a place of meeting for people who cannot imagine their life without Bitcoin. And it is the only place in Berlin which intentionally does not accept plastic cards. The hostess of this shop says that there is no need to monitor the Bitcoin exchange rate to be informed about the status of Bitcoin.

Some argue, however, that this time it may be different because for the first time in its history Bitcoin has a capped transaction capacity.\nTransaction volume and price\nThe relationship between price and transaction volume has been identified as early as 2013 with the following chart showing a remarkable correlation:\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Metcalf\u2019s Law \u2013 Source: Peter Rizun\nDue to Bitcoin\u2019s transaction cap, the price has recently seen what many commentators suggest is an unprecedented level of stability, inching towards the range of $470. It may yet break higher, especially as we get closer to the halving, but such breakouts are usually followed by an increased level of transactions, which causes increased delays, leading to complaints and a potential break on price advances.\nIf this pattern is repeated and the price does not compensate for the reduced supply, the least profitable miners may turn off their hashrate, leading to further mining centralization.\nConcerns\nConcerns have been raised that during the two-week period between miners turning off their hashrate and difficulty readjustment, confirmation delays may be exacerbated as blocks take longer to be found. This leads to an increase in fees and a reduction in price, making even more unprofitable miners turn off their hashrate in what may be a downward spiral.\nIn response to such concerns it is likely that huge mining farms have taken precautions to prevent any downward spiral. Moreover, according to recent analysis, some\u00a0pool\u2019s profitability\u00a0is as high as 135%, with most standing above 100%, but Kano pool, which currently has approximately 2% network wide hash-share is only 65% profitable.\nOnce supply is halved, they may be operating at a loss. Some other pools, such as Antpool, stand at only 105%, which would be reduced by the halving to a tight margin of 5%, assuming no further difficulty increases. At that margin, a profit could quickly turn to a loss.", "birthday": "2016-05-16T15:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-16 14:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 16}

Developing an application Sberbank considered both the time and energy which are usually spent searching for information about certain service or a product online. Thus, Sberbank Messenger saves users\u2019 time by granting an access to thousands of products and services, as well as information about them, which is available directly from providers, manufacturers and other users.\nSmart search\nAmong several functions Sberbank Messenger offers its users \u00a0to run a smart search. The function is grounded on two types of technologies. \u00a0The first one recognizes the interest area of the user\u2019s request by asking a few additional questions in a natural language, while another technology selects the most relevant service providers, based on the information about the user, mainly data about previous transactions.\nFor both of these technologies, solutions created by Rubbles\u00a0are being tested.\nMulti-layered security\nDeveloping mobile applications Sberbank prioritises safety and data security, thus Sberbank\u2019s crew of developers has introduced the first online banking mobile application with a built-in strong \u00a0antivirus component.\nSecurity checkpoints incorporated in Sberbank Messenger range from a thorough moderation process and careful feedback and rankings, to integration of blockchain technology, which secures the platform from any risks of scamming or fraud.\nSberbank Messenger was designed to leverage the fast growing area of conversational commerce, creating a space where consumers can interact with friends, family members, colleagues and business partners, as well as local service providers in one platform.\nParticipants and visitors of Finovate Spring which took place on 10-11 May were among the first to see the presentation of the app.\nFinovate showcases technology side of fintech\nFinovate is a conference series which focuses on financial technology. Topics covered at the events range from bit rewards, alternative payments, P2P lending, security solutions, mobile apps, and next-generation online banking platforms.\nFinovate showcases the best among new financial and banking technologies. \u00a0Competition among applicants is rather high. Therefore, novelty of the product, its originality and potential are put at the core in the selection process of the participants. Sberbank Messenger was chosen from 800 global banks and fintech companies offering their product applications to be presented at the Conference.\nVladimir Stasevich, the mobile products lead of Sberbank\u2019s Bank XXI, says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cSberbank has been actively working on the development of conversational commerce technologies before, however, we have not presented a completed product anywhere yet\u201d. \nThe audience at Finovate conferences consists of high-impact senior financial and banking executives, venture capitalists, press, industry analysts, bloggers, regulators, and entrepreneurs.\nVladimir Stasevich says:\n \u201cFinovate is a number 1 financial innovations platform. Unfortunately, at the moment no similar events take place in Russia, therefore it did not take long to make a decision about showcasing Sberbank Messenger at Finovate. We would like to get feedback from other fintech experts as it would allow us to re-evaluate and moderate our approach. We would not be able to get feedback from top-level fintech experts anywhere else.\u201d \nSberbank intends to test new modes of interaction with customers through Sberbank Messenger.\nIt is planning to explore more thoroughly people\u2019s behavioral patterns in messengers and chats, and apply these findings for the development of other Sberbank\u2019s products and services.\n", "birthday": "2016-05-16T17:10:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-16 16:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 16}

", "content": "Cryptocurrency allows immunity from interjections and the handling of central banks. It gives us freedom of our economic management. Cointelegraph talked to Pascal H. Hamonic, a core member of Nu (NuBits), decentralized startup in peer-to-peer banking, Petros Anagnostou, Chief Marketing Officer, and Mourad Ilyes Mlik, IT Engineer, of CreditBit, an open source software project released under the MIT/X11 license, about alternative cryptocurrencies and fintech innovations.\nCryptocurrency compared to fiat is neither stored nor checked by central banks or governments. \u00a0You possess all your money, and the system is secure thanks to the peer technology Peer2Peer. The counterfeiting is unfeasible.\nJulien Yuki Hamonic, core member of Nubits, says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cA new thought form to structure organizations is emerging: the Blockchain. Take a look at Nu, the DAO which is issuing the dollar pegged US-NBT. NuShareholders mirror holographically the whole blockchain, this pattern of blockchain is being found again in another scale of itself,\u00a0B&C exchange. Though its parts are not related by any hierarchical relationship, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and produce a meaningful business value. May the Blockchain be spread fractally, holographically and synergistically!\u201d \nProof of validation\nCT: The coin Nubits since it is a PoS, has a form of currency and NuShares is the solution for Proof of Validation, that way solves the problem that PoS have?\nPascal H. Hamonic: The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), called Nu is a DAC whose business is to issue stable crypto-currencies, called NuBits. Nu is a fork of Peershares which is a fork of peercoin.\nAs you may know, Peercoin is the first PoS coin. So Nu is indeed PoS. The way it works is that shareholders who hold NuShares vote. By voting they contribute to the business of the DAC (Nu). By doing so, they contribute to the security of the network by verifying blocks.\nThe probability of being able to verify a block depends on how much percentage you own. So let us say that you have 10% of Nu. In that case, 10% of the time you will be able to verify blocks. By the way, 1 block per minute with Nu (=NuBits + NuShares).\nInvestments and Visa/MasterCard payment option\nCT: Do you plan issuing new shares to get investment?\nPH: Shareholders of Nu hold shares called NuShares. With NuShares they vote for anything, including monetary policies. Nu would need to issue new NuShares in order to maintain the peg, if needed. We did that twice last year.\nCT: How do you get rewards, the wallet is a node?\nPH: Well when you verify blocks, you get a reward (a minting reward or a voting reward if you will), which is right 40 NuShares per block. Yes, the wallet is a node. Well if you want to verify blocks, you need to enable the minting function though.\nCT: The merchants if they want to accept Nubits, will this be implemented by Visa or MasterCard as other currencies have done?\nPH: \u00a0Right now the best way to pay with NuBits is to use NuDroid (android wallet). With it, you can pay any merchants with NuBits who accept Bitcoin. As for the credit card payment, we have only NanoCard of CCEDK right now. With NanoCard you can charge with NuBits.\nPrice and wallet\nCT: The price has to be kept steady at 1$ but at coin market I see ups and downs, how this could affect the Nubits?\nPH: It is a peg around 1USD -+ 0.2%. \u00a0The peg has been kept quite tightly overall since the inception.\nCT: \u00a0The Shareholders of NuShares, how they been informed for the voting system, and are they capable to be notified by the wallet?\nPH: Mainly we discuss everything inside the forum. But we have indicators of the liquidity such as inside the client or here. There are some plans to alert shareholders about certain things inside the wallets such as mandatory updates or any other urgent messages.\nCT: Do you monitor from which countries the users are more interested in the project?\nPH: We have some indicators. So it is pretty well spread over the Globe: US, Canada, Europe (Germany, UK, Spain, Greece, France), China, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, South America. With NuBits, you can remit US dollars for very cheap (1 cent) and instantly.\nNu is the first decentralized central bank in the world who issue NuBits, the first crypto-dollar with a stable prize 1NBT = 1USD. Value stability is highly desirable in a currency, and we expect more and more users will begin using NuBits for online purchases.\nWhat is CreditBit\nPetros Anagnostou: CreditBit is an open source digital currency protocol which is 10 times better than Bitcoin when it comes to the speed and rate of transactions. CreditBit prepares for mass adoption by offering a user-friendly and secure cryptocurrency easily accessible to users worldwide.\nCT: Are transactions traceable?\nMourad Ilyes Mlik: CreditBit was Asic resistant at the PoW stage, now the PoW stage has ended and we are a pure PoS coin so we don't have issues with ASICs or 51% attacks. Creditbit transactions are traceable, you can gain anonymity by using coin mixers.\nCT: Which platform wallets do CreditBit support?\nPA: CreditBit has wallets for all platforms (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux) and the wallet works as a peer. About 2700 wallets between Creditbit-QT and Electrum have been downloaded up until now .\nCreditbit is already in 7 exchanges: (Bittrex - Livecoin - YoBit - C-Cex - Cryptopia - Bloombit - Bitsquare).

Will the Empire of the Sun move ahead of all to completely embrace digital assets?\nJapan has recently overtaken the United States to become the world's second largest Bitcoin market. This development may come as a surprise to many considering the decline that the Japanese economy has had over the last two decades.\nBut will the Empire of the Sun move ahead of all to completely embrace digital assets?\nA Galapagos environment\nJapan is an unusual case even among developed nations. The insular nature of the country means that many Japanese think in the terms of Japan AND the world instead of Japan IN the world.\nHistorically Japan has always been delinked from most of the world by its own choice. It was only in the closing period of the Edo times, known as Bakumatsu, between 1853 and 1867 that Japan finally ended its isolationist foreign policy known as Sakoku.\nDuring the period of Sakoku no foreigner could enter Japan nor a Japanese leave the country as the penalty for doing so was death. This historic isolation has had an impact on modern Japan.\nWhat makes Japan different\nJapan is also a special case when it comes to Bitcoin. The growth of Bitcoin in Japan is more or less driven by the unique factors which affect the local economy. \u00a0These factors are a result of a deflationary trend which has now persisted for decades.\nA change in demography has resulted in a rapidly ageing population. Measures taken by the Bank of Japan as well as the Japanese government have led to years of zero and now sub zero interest rates.\nCointelegraph talked with Kagayaki Kawabata (Kaga), Business Development Lead at Coincheck.com\u00a0about what makes Japan different from other Bitcoin markets.\nKagayaki Kawabata says:\n \u201cCompared to other countries around the world there is no large gap between rich and poor in Japan where 96% of adults have a bank account. It seems that a wide-range of the \u00a0population are interested in investment. For example, at Coincheck, there are 60 year-old traders who buy and sell Bitcoin at our exchange. Also, Japan is one of the biggest Forex markets. We assume that some of the population of Forex traders are also investing in Bitcoin. Furthermore, the Bank of Japan recently adopted a negative interest rate policy. Due to this policy, keeping money in the bank might diminish one's assets. Because of such a change in the environment, we think people in Japan are finding a better place to invest their money and Bitcoin is one which has potential.\u201d \nZero Interest Rates Makes Bitcoin interesting\nZero interest rates are certainly a factor. Not only did Kaga of Coincheck echo sentiments about Zero and negative interest rates being a factor which are boosting Bitcoin in Japan but so did Ken Shishido, Co-organizer of Tokyo Bitcoin Meetup Group.\nKen Shishido says:\n \u201cMore and more people are becoming more concerned about the government policy especially after the announcement of BOJ\u2019s negative interest policy. However, very few people will be able understand Bitcoin and be able to buy Bitcoin as a long-term investment or ultimate hedge, in my opinion. For speculative purposes, the Bitcoin market is getting more attention from FX traders since the combined transaction volume of seven exchanges in Japan has now surpassed some 59,100,000,000 yen ($544M) as of April 2015.People love gambling, I guess.\u201d \nWe also talked with Takao Asayama, CEO of Tech Bureau Corp (Zaif Exchange).\nAsayama says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cBelieve it or not, Japan has the largest forex trade market in the world, which is like 40%, as I know of. I believe Japanese people would love bitcoin trade as high-volatility product. Japan is kinda \"late\" by a year or two, compared to US or Europe adopting cryptocoins, once we Japanese do, which I always say \"when it hits boiling point\", market here could outgrow US or Europe, or even Chinese market. As a payment method, numbers of retail store accepting bitcoins are growing but still, it is kind of slow. That will follows other countries when more people earn benefit from trade.\u201d \nThe Future of Bitcoin Shines Bright in Japan\nJapan has recently proposed new laws which would give Bitcoin a legal status in the country. We have covered this in detail in a previous article.\nShishido told us that some young programmers and developers as well as internet companies in Japan are realising the potential of Bitcoin and are working on various projects in Japan. He thinks that this will have a good outcome. He is also of the view that Japan has a huge token and coupon market and there is a culture of collecting points at shops. Indeed. the Japanese almost always carry with them a pointok\u0101do or a point card and use this sort of a card to collect points each time they make purchases. These points can later be redeemed for merchandise or other rewards. Shishido thinks that if Bitcoin can somehow find a break as a point card utility it will help it to go mainstream.\nIt is already very easy to buy and sell Bitcoin in Japan and all it takes is a smartphone according to Kaga. His own company Coincheck allows users to create an account instantly just by signing up with their Facebook account.\nAccording to Kaga, some exchanges in Japan allow users to purchase Bitcoins in convenience stores! This sort of ease of use will probably help Japan leap ahead of other nations when it comes to digital assets.\nPromoting Bitcoin awareness in Japan\nBringing Bitcoin to more people in Japan is something that is as much of a concern in Japan as elsewhere.", "birthday": "2016-05-13T14:13:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-13 13:13:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 13}

Some 80% of Africans don\u2019t have a bank account or a credit card, but they do have a phone, and most of those will soon be a smartphone.\nAlso, despite one in seven African (120 millions) receiving remittances from friends and family abroad totalling USD 60 billion, Africans pay the highest transaction fees in the world.\nAfrica\u2019s mobile wallets\u2019 fragmentation presents AMoney with the significant opportunity to unify the structure of a fragmented e-commerce backbone. It takes advantage of the strong local footholds built by carriers to improve the almost non-existent cross-border payments capability.\nBitPesa accepts Bitcoin\nBitPesa\u00a0has been offering a world-class platform to trade in digital currency. It is a localized solution for its users to participate directly in global finance with diversified financial tools.\nBitPesa allows individuals and businesses to send payments to and from Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, and Tanzania and accepts Bitcoin from nearly anywhere in the world and exchange it for local African currencies.\nIt enables recipients to receive local currency into mobile money wallets or bank accounts and also sells Bitcoin in its operational countries, except for Tanzania.\nIt recently closed a follow-on round of $1.1M in a second round of funding led by San Francisco-based Pantera Capital bringing its 2014 total equity to over $1.7M.", "birthday": "2016-05-13T17:10:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-13 16:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 13}

Craig Wright Is a Very Bad Satoshi Anyway ", "content": "Here is what we know about Wright for certain: he is a pathological liar, he has serious problems with the Australian tax service and he has been interested in Bitcoin for quite a while.\nIn truth, it\u2019s fairly easy to prove that you\u2019re Satoshi. One just has to sell or transfer bitcoins from any of the earliest blocks, which are known with almost complete certainty to have been generated by Nakamoto.\nResurrection of a hero\nThe IT industry is usually quite boring, when compared to, say, drug trafficking, and it\u2019s not even about the lack of rowdy people.\nOn the contrary, there are a lot of rowdy people in IT, it\u2019s just that when an introverted nerd riots, it usually ends up with them moving to another corner of the room and tapping on their keyboard louder than usual.\nEven Jobs and Zuckerberg turned out to be mediocre movie heroes. However, all that sea of IT tranquility was violently disrupted the other day, and the news came from an unexpected direction: a glorious detective plot, which makes \u201cThe Thomas Crown Affair\u201d look like a bedtime story in comparison. The story is about the resurrection of Satoshi Nakamoto.\nSatoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym used by a person (or a group of people), who developed Bitcoin and blockchain eight years ago.\nThey were also the ones who programmed the first version of Bitcoin source code and published it in the public domain. And it was Satoshi who said \u201cSo long and thanks for all the fish\u201d to the other developers back in 2010 and then mysteriously vanished.\nDon\u2019t touch the grandpa\nWho is (or who are) Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown to this day. In November 2013, when one bitcoin was worth more than $1000, Nakamoto\u2019s net worth exceeded one billion dollars. Naturally, that is a purely technical evaluation, as any attempt by Satoshi to sell any significant amount of their bitcoins would result in a collapse of the price rate. In any case, they have not sold a single cent\u2019s worth of bitcoins.\nThe fact is, Satoshi had not displayed any lifesigns up until 2014, when Newsweek reporters found an unfortunate old man with the same last name living in the US, deciding that he is none other than Bitcoin\u2019s maker.\nAbout that time the last message to date was sent by the supposedly actual Satoshi Nakamoto - \u201cleave the grandpa alone\u201d. Not everyone was convinced that that message was sent by Nakamoto himself, but the grandpa was left alone regardless.\nMedia-savvy God\nDuring the years of their absence, Satoshi turned into a myth, a quasi-religious symbol.\nAny argument about the future development of Bitcoin - and there are furious arguments aplenty - just has to include the phrase \u201cwhat would Satoshi say to that?\u201d at some point.\nNobody can truly know what would Satoshi say, because Satoshi was not very talkative when they were around; however, it\u2019s usually quite easy to finish the opinion of someone without their actual input, after they have been missing for several years.\nAnd now, that finely balanced system of hopes and beliefs has been violently disrupted by an Australian businessman Craig Wright, who says: \u201cguys, all I want is some peace and quiet, but the thing is, I\u2019m Satoshi. Dudes, it\u2019s me, your Old Testament god who has left the heavens for a couple of years, but I\u2019m back now!\u201d\nHowever, here comes the funny part: Craig Wright is a very bad Satoshi, in the sense that he\u2019s nothing like the Satoshi mythos.\nHere is what we know about Wright for certain: he is a pathological liar (up to his own LinkedIn profile containing completely false information about his scientific degrees), he has serious problems with the Australian tax service, he has been interested in Bitcoin for quite a while, and he also appears to have spent some tens of millions of dollars on buying supercomputers.\nIn truth, it\u2019s fairly easy to prove that you\u2019re Satoshi. One just has to sell or transfer bitcoins from any of the earliest blocks, which are known with almost complete certainty to have been generated by Nakamoto.\nBut Wright has chosen a different approach. Firstly, he has contacted The Economist, BBC and, for some reason, GQ (such a great plan, when all you need is peace and quiet). Secondly, he has personally met Gavin Andersen, one of the core developers of Bitcoin, who has been communicating with the actual Satoshi a lot via email. For the sake of the experiment\u2019s purity, one of Wright\u2019s assistants bought a new, clean laptop, which Wright then used to prove to Gavin, that he has access to Satoshi\u2019s private keys. Thirdly, he hasn\u2019t even touched Satoshi\u2019s blocks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s him,\u201d said Gavin.\n\u201cIt\u2019s him,\u201d said BBC.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really clear,\u201d said The Economist.\n\nBelieve me\nWright then goes on to publish another proof in his blog, but several hours later it is discovered that that proof doesn\u2019t prove anything; in fact, it\u2019s not proof at all, but rather sleight of hand.\n\u201cNo no,\u201d says Gavin, \u201cit\u2019s him, believe me!\u201d\nThe developers\u2019 community is at a loss. Gavin is either an accomplice of a con artist, a victim of some secret service, or an idiot. Any one of those options is not satisfactory. Gavin is quickly eliminated from the core devs of Bitcoin, with the sole exception of the right to read code. There was another factor at play here: Gavin has been bothering everyone in that team for a while now, but the excuse itself is nonetheless suiting.\nDan Kaminsky, who could not believe that Gavin is an idiot, sent him an email.\n\u201cGavin, what the hell?\u201d - wrote Dan.\n\u201cI\u2019ve no idea myself,\u201d answered Gavin, \u201cI had hoped that Satoshi would publish a good proof, but he has published some rubbish instead. I should probably have not said that he\u2019s Satoshi beforehand.\u201d But it\u2019s already too late.\nSet up\nIn the meanwhile, Wright-Satoshi who has successfully set Gavin up, publishes a new post.\n\u201cGuys,\u201d Wright wrote, \u201cI know that my previous proof does not prove anything, so I\u2019ll be publishing the proof one of these days. Maybe, I\u2019ll even move some of my bitcoins, so stay tuned.\u201d\nIt\u2019s completely unclear, as to why he did that, because moving some bitcoins is much faster than writing pointless blog posts, provided that Wright does have access to said coins.\nSo here\u2019s the bottom line: there are some Bitcoin old-timers who have confirmed that Wright is Satoshi (jeopardizing their reputations in the process). There is Wright himself - a rather shady figure, who has claimed several times over the past couple of days to have irrefutable proof, but has never provided it. And there are several millions of dollars worth of Satoshi\u2019s bitcoins.\nIt\u2019s not clear why Wright does what he does, if he\u2019s the real Satoshi. It\u2019s not really clear why he does it if he\u2019s not Satoshi - I mean, this can\u2019t go on forever, even Gavin has to become doubtful at some point.\nHowever, there are several elegant theories about Wright\u2019s reasons.\nThe first option is that Craig Wright is, in fact, Satoshi, and his behavior is explained simply by him being insane (and it\u2019s our fault for deifying the guy - you have to be simpler than that), or, alternatively, this is all a ruse to make everyone believe that he\u2019s actually not Satoshi.\nThe latter being less probable, because nobody would even guess that Wright is Satoshi, if not for Wright\u2019s own actions.\nGod is dead\nBut personally, I like a different theory. It\u2019s beautifully intriguing, albeit a quite fantastic one.\nAccording to that theory, the real Satoshi Nakamoto is a friend of Craig Wright, David Kleiman. He\u2019s a much more likely genius loner; additionally, he is already deceased (and the dates more or less match up - Kleiman got significantly worse at about the same time when Satoshi said their goodbye and went missing).\nStrictly speaking, it\u2019s irrelevant for this theory if Kleiman was actually Satoshi or not; what\u2019s important is that Craig believes that.\nSo, Kleiman dies, a billion dollars is left untouched, and the only person who knows about that is Craig Wright. He tricks Kleiman\u2019s relatives (father and brother) into giving up his private files (they were colleagues, after all), but the tricky part is that the files are encrypted.\nOK, says Craig, goes to investors to tell them that he\u2019s Satoshi, and takes several tens of millions of dollars to build a supercomputer, which will crack the code.\nA couple of years later, he manages to access parts of correspondence (that\u2019s how he tricked Gavin), but still can\u2019t reach the money.", "birthday": "2016-05-09T16:34:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-09 15:34:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 9}

Cointelegraph investigates the feasibility of such a suggestion.\nTraditional methods of hiding assets\nIn most cases, assets in divorce are hidden through relatively simple means with varying legality. That includes transferring money from joint accounts to private accounts; transferring assets to a friend prior to the divorce; undervaluing assets; or simply storing assets as cash in a hidden safety deposit box.\nHowever, there are other more complex methods including overpaying the IRS, or other relevant tax agency, and then collecting the tax refund after the divorce proceedings. You can also try taking regular cash withdrawals on debit cards; defer promotions, raises or commission payments until after the divorce, or claim memory loss regarding employer retirement accounts or stock options.\nIf you are a business owner, things become a whole lot easier for you. For example, you can defer invoicing clients, create fake business expenses, or use \u2018company\u2019 assets to buy expensive goods like art and furniture, which you can then sell later.\nHiding assets through Bitcoin\nBitcoin would seem to provide the best of both worlds if you want to hide assets in a divorce, but firstly, it goes without saying that you must ensure Bitcoin is legal in your country before your start investigating.\nIt\u2019s much easier to hold anonymously - all you need is the private key written in a hidden place, say the inner sole of your shoe, and you\u2019re set.\nIn addition, the government and law industry is lagging behind terribly when it comes to an understanding of cryptocurrencies, so it would likely not even cross a solicitor or judge\u2019s mind to consider looking for crypto-assets.", "birthday": "2016-05-11T14:46:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-11 13:46:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 11}

", "content": "Was the inventor of Bitcoin a man found dead in horribly tragic circumstances?\nA few days ago Cointelegraph carried an article by my colleague Cyril Gilson, which asked the question God is Dead? Craig Wright Is a Very Bad Satoshi Anyway.\nCyril proposed that David Kleiman may have been Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic inventor of Bitcoin, the world\u2019s most famous cryptocurrency. We have covered the topic of Satoshi Nakamoto extensively in the past and being a Cryptocurrency publication, I am sure that we will touch on this subject in the future as well.\nOne thing is for certain that anything you read online surrounding this topic will involve a certain amount of conjecture.\nWho is Satoshi Nakamoto is turning out to be a mystery that is a case fit for M. Hercule Poirot. Here is a theory that we must consider as well.\nA grisly end, a promising beginning and a bravely led life\nDavid Alan Kleiman is no longer with us, he died in April of 2013 after having been confined to a wheelchair for years following a motorcyle accident in 1995.\nHe was all of 46 years old. David died in abject poverty and was found in his Riviera Beach, Florida house which was facing foreclosure. According to Gizmodo his body was found in a state of decomposition, with wheelchair tracks of blood and fecal matter covering the room. A loaded gun and open bottles of alcohol were also discovered by his side.\nA bullet hole in the mattress suggested that a gun had been discharged in the room at some point but no casings were found. Keiman had been suffering years of ill health and had been infected with MRSA, which was the most likely reason for his demise.\nHowever things were not always so bad for David who was a US Army veteran and a deputy for Palm Beach County Sheriff. An obituary in Florida Weekly described him as being 6\u2019 tall and weighing over 200 lbs.\nAfter being rehabilitated from the effects of the motorcycle accident, he started getting more interested in computers and started a company called Computer Forensics LLC with two business partners Carter Conrad and Patrick Paige.\nDavid would not let his disability come in the way of his passion: Computers.\n\nThe Common Threads\nWhy would we consider David Kleiman as Satoshi Nakamoto. There are two reasons for that. One is the connection between Satoshi Nakamoto and David Kleiman and the second the connection between Craig Wright and David Kleiman.\nCraig Wright has attempted to come out as Satoshi Nakamoto recently with futile results. However, it can be that either Craig was aware of who the real Nakamoto was or he was part of a team or at least on the sidelines of a team that were or are Satoshi Nakamoto.\nDavid Kleiman was a contributor to computer security mailing lists in the early 2000s and these lists were maintained by securityfocus.com and metzdowd.com. It is thus a strange coincidence that we find that Satoshi Nakamoto also used metzdowd.com during the early times of Bitcoin.\nIn fact Satoshi\u2019s famous paper was released in a Metzdowd.com list in 2008. Now we come to the connection between Wright and Kleiman. Gizmodo claim that they have emails between both Wright and Kleiman. In fact, in the emails they have, Wright is asking for Kleiman\u2019s help.\nThe email reads:\n \u201cI need your help editing a paper I am going to release later this year. I have been working on a new form of electronic money. Bit cash, Bitcoin...You are always there for me Dave.

However, it and other cryptocurrencies still have a long road ahead of them. One major part of that effort is the integration of cryptocurrencies with the traditional money systems.\nAfter all, if the community wants Bitcoin and others to become as widespread and usable as the dollar or euro, the digital currencies have to become a natural part of that environment.\nCheap deposits and instant withdrawals\nCEX.io was one of the first to introduce the option to deposit funds to their exchange via traditional Visa and MasterCard cards. And just now, the company has reported that the total amount of funds deposited via bank cards has reached $40M, across 600,000 users registered at the exchange.\nOleksandr Lutskevych, CEO and Co-Founder of CEX.IO, says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cThe recent Money 20/20 Europe conference held in Copenhagen proved that blockchain technology and related businesses are in the spotlight of FinTech. We operate as a broad and reliable bridge between people who are willing to buy Bitcoin and the blockchain industry. As credit cards are still the most common thing in users\u2019 pockets, no matter what country they come from, we decided to direct our efforts to user-friendly, fast and cheap Bitcoin purchases using payment cards.\u201d \n\nMargin trading\nAnother major announcement coming from CEX.io is the addition of margin trading. One of the most essential features for professional traders, margin trading is already present on several major cryptocurrency exchanges.\nLutskevych explains:\n \u201cWe are preparing to launch beta testing of Bitcoin margin trading to satisfy the needs of traders. Margin trading on CEX.IO will imply several levels of leverage, and a special algorithm for calculating risks, and thus, a user will never be in the red, even in critical situations.\" \nA lot of major cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Bitfinex, Poloniex, Kraken and others, already offer the margin trading feature. However, Lutskevych says that margin trading on CEX.IO is advantageous because a user will never be in the red, even in most critical situations, thanks to a special algorithm for calculating risks.

The answer we want to give for the currently discussed Blockchain interpretation is \u2018so far, no\u2019 \u2013 contrary to\u00a0common opinion.\nThe reason being is that for none of the Blockchain technology specifica is there is a clear path to attract users to the platform.\nThey are just like banks\nWhat is it that triggers the communities fantasy on disrupting data monopolists such as Facebook, Uber, Airbnb and ebay?\nForemost, there is an obvious analogy to banks. There are two parties, who want to work together (send money, chat, have a ride, rent a flat, trade an item) but need a middleman to facilitate this. Usually, this entity takes too much of a slice of the cake. In the case of banks, it is even worse.\nHow Blockchain could disrupt data monopolists\nBlockchains can be extended beyond the database paradigm towards a general application platform. These platforms work very differently. For example, they have shared virtualized databases, micropayments and consensus mechanisms, from common on-premise or on-cloud platforms that they have the potential to re-implement the named examples while not allowing one party to monopolize the platform.\nThe main Blockchains like Bitcoin are an example for a distributed autonomous organization.\nThese are organizations centered around code as their \u2018constitution\u2019 and have as its main players users, developers, miners (those that render the infrastructure) and evangelists. They are rewarded by tokens (e.g. Bitcoin) and sometimes in softer currencies such as reputation, career opportunities and even fame.\nUsually there is a board and a foundation at the heart of the organization, who can also grant permanent salaries for a small core team. Decisions on directions of the system have to be made in a democratic way between all parties involved, even though there may not be a formalized consensus.\nEthereum and smart contracts\nOne example for the first paradigm would be Ethereum, other similar examples would be\u00a0tendermint or\u00a0fermat.\nThe most prominent Blockchain application platform Ethereum has at its core the idea to extend the Bitcoin model to a turing complete application platform, on which so-called smart contracts in languages such as solidity, a javascript dialect, could be defined.\nSmart Contracts are an interesting concept with use cases, which so far are not common use cases in the industry. They often incorporate payments, here in ether, and usually they are paid based on the fulfilment of certain conditions. If such conditions can be determined inside the Blockchain (someone else paid or transferred a digital asset) the concept is straightforward.\nIf one needs an external datastream (stock values on day xyz), the challenge is to incorporate the data stream in order for it to be trusted by all sites.\nRe-doing the middleman\nNow, how could such Blockchain application platforms serve to \u2018re-do\u2019 the above listed \u2018middleman\u2019. Possible answers are often a combination of the following:\n There is a shared, virtual infrastructure which cannot be dominated by one central vendor, rendered by Miners. Data in the underlying Blockchain is publicly shared (secured by cryptography) and cannot be changed because of Blockchain immutability features. The application code running on such platforms is publicly available and execution cannot be tempered with based on Blockchain immutability features. The distributed autonomous organization running the platform cannot be dominated by one vendor as its nature is that of a decentralized organization arranged around code with checks and balances between individuals, organizations and roles (users, miners, merchants, developers etc. \u2026 ) Ownerships & Incentives to contribute to such a platform can naturally be rewarded in tokens of the system expressed in a virtual currency. One advantage here is that payments can be executed peer2peer, directly between the two parties without a \u2018man in the middle\u2019. \nPlus Technology, minus Marketing\nSometimes one can see what one might euphemistically call a \u2018metaphorical argumentation\u2019 \u00a0which uses concepts like consensus (associating democratic votings), shared and distributed (implying there is no central monopolist) and community or movement, referring to the network of individuals, communities around a technology like Bitcoin.\nFor our purposes, we want to simply discard such metaphors as marketing.\nAll layers of this technology stack (Infrastructure, Database, Application Server, Organization, Incentive structure) clearly differ from on-premise or cloud traditional models, which tend to be dominated by a few technology vendors. This promises some exciting possibilities and interesting opportunities to write applications.\nFor the case of a \u2018man in the middle\u2019 \u00a0facilitating data exchange between two parties who want to engage in business conversations \u2013 our claim is that none of this matters. Hence, if that is so, there should be no expectation that a Blockchain-Facebook, Blockchain-Uber, Blockchain-Airbnb or Blockchain-eBay would per se, just based on technology, be a serious competitor.\nHow about professionality?\nUndoubtedly, one can build such systems. Potentially there are benefits in such systems for parties and the position of the middleman might be weaker if we move more towards a DAO running of such a system. However, distributed autonomous organizations or net-communities exist but we don\u2019t see them maturing to the level of professionality that would be necessary to compete.\nThe different incentive structure, payments by cryptocurrency could let serious and professional efforts grow \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen it so far, which doesn\u2019t imply that it is impossible. But so far it seems for most developers conventional payment forms like fixed salaries or fees in the store of a large dominating vendor, seem more attractive.\nSome might hope that verifiable code could attract clients as the platforms inherently might be more apt at creating trust. Many, including the author, would doubt the technical implementation layer matters for a user.\nMaking Blockchain successful\nIf none of these points matters, what would matter to make Blockchain technology successful in that space ?\nIt is the same ingredient that makes such platforms successful for any Technology. It\u2019s the data shared by users, the amount and type of users engaging in conversations or trade over the platforms.\nUsers go where users are, this is a given fact, and Blockchains won\u2019t change that.", "birthday": "2016-05-11T17:48:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-11 16:48:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 11}

A simple transaction made with a credit card by a customer at a retail store could attract transaction fees of up to 2%. Bitcoin can reduce transaction fees to negligible amounts because it is decentralized and it removes the role of the intermediary.\nSpeaking at the Museum of American Finance on Wall Street, Larry Summers says:\n \u201cIf the day ever comes where Bitcoin counts for an appreciable fraction of commerce which takes place in the world economy, on that day it will be because that commerce is regulated and subject to safeguards and people believe that something other than a mathematical algorithm is ensuring that their money will not be stolen.\u201d \n\nDiffering Views from the Financial Sector", "birthday": "2016-05-08T16:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-08 15:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 8}

His investment very much paid off.\nWhen he was 15, only a year and a half later, he liquidated his Bitcoins, making a cool $100,000. He\u2019s now crowdfunding his very own VR headset. He has been featured in Time Magazine, Mashable, CBS News, Business Insider, The Times, BBC, and more.\nFrom Bitcoin investment to Marvel VR headset\nAfter Bitcoin\u2019s price skyrocketed past the $1000 per bitcoin mark in 2014, Erik Finman, having presumably bought in at the sub-$100 per bitcoin mark in 2013, sold for monumental profits.\nIn his TEDxTeen talk, he says about this experience:\n \u201cI was competitive with my brother. And he was going on and on about this thing called Bitcoin, which, he said, was going to replace the dollar, was the currency of the future. I didn\u2019t really care but I wanted him to shut up. Using all the money that I saved up, I decided to buy more coins than he had. That turned out really well for the future.\u201d \nErik then used these newly acquired funds to start up an online tutoring service called Botangle. He wanted to address some of the negative experiences he had with the educational system and provide learning that was focused on the student.\n\u201cHigh School dropout that made 100k & started Botangle\u201d, as he put it in his LinkedIn profile, Erik seems to have moved on, at least temporarily, from the world of online education, and has made plans to launch his own virtual reality headset, The Marvel.\nThe Marvel is a VR headset that is designed to work exclusively with a large array of Android smartphones.\n\nThe device differs from other competitors in the market in that its purpose is not solely to view 360\u00b0 VR content. The user plugs in their Android phone and the headset presents all open applications in a semi-circle around you, hovering in the air.\nMoving your head around will have the expected effect, allowing you to view all your open apps. You can view multiple windows at once, and connecting a keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth is also possible.\nWhen a virtual reality app is opened on the phone, it is recognised by the Marvel, which inserts you into the app\u2019s 360\u00b0 environment.\nThe headset looks very much the same to other headsets on the market, like the Samsung Gear VR, Oculus Rift, and HTC Vive, but like Samsung\u2019s headset, the visor is larger to accommodate a phone. All Android phones running Lollipop OS or higher will be able to use the headset.\n\nThe Marvel Team\nDespite seeming to have overlooked a huge opportunity to call their development team \u2018The Avengers\u2019, the team chose the path or least lawsuits, and, with seven or eight people working on the project, with various experience in manufacturing and shipping electronics, Finman assures potential buyers of their purchase.\nHe says to Mashable:\n \u201cAlthough I am new to manufacturing, these people are not\u2026 For me, I'm glad that I've hired people that have a lot of experience in shipping and a lot of experience with third-party logistics providers, and a lot of manufacturing and developing experience.

Will halving be a boon to Bitcoin or an absolute curse that will lead to a spectacular crash?\nMoney needs to be printed to be used, it has to be brought into circulation. Whether it is paper based or virtual, someone has to decide how much of it is going to be brought to life and when.\nFiat currency and Bitcoin mining\nUsually fiat currencies are printed by central banks to control inflation or as a part of a wider monetary policy of a nation-state.\nIn case of virtual currencies, since there is no national government involved or fixed borders, other means need to be deployed to manage money supply.\nBitcoin is supplied by \u2018mining\u2019 a process which involves doing complicated mathematical calculations using special software and hardware.\nThe creator of Bitcoin ensured that only a limited amount of Bitcoin could ever be brought into circulation and that number is pegged at 21 million.\nHe or She also ensured that mining becomes progressively difficult as time goes along and more Bitcoin are mined.\nWe know from Blockchain.info that as of April 2016, there are about 15 million plus Bitcoin in circulation.\n\nSource: Blockchain.info\nThe halving and what it is all about\nThe Bitcoin system was so designed that from time to time mining value is halved.\nThe next time this is supposed to happen is on July 11, 2016. Halving will have a dramatic effect on miners as their income will drop significantly.\nThe difficulty level of mining Bitcoin will also ensure that smaller miners will no longer find it viable to mine the cryptocurrency leaving the mining space to large operators or pooled mining companies.\nThis trend has already been observed with the Chinese taking up mining on a large scale and mining more than half of the Bitcoin mining that happens today.\nSo what effect will halving have on Bitcoin? Will it lead to an increase in Bitcoin prices or is it time for a massive crash? We talked with a few industry experts.\nThe long and short of it\nExperts are definitely split into two when it comes to Bitcoin price after halving and those that are bullish on halving have their own reasons.\nHowever we tried to get both a short term and long term view of the halving situation.\nAleksandar Matanovic, CEO of ECD.rs, a Bitcoin exchange, says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cShort term, I think price will go down. A lot of people are expecting the price to rise after the halving and those who want to take advantage of that will buy before the halving, hoping to sell at the higher price after the halving. It will push the price up prior to the halving.\u201d \nMatanovic thinks that according to the Efficient Market Hypothesis prices already reflect all information that is available to them and have factored in the halving.\nHe thinks that the current prices have taken the phenomenon into account and that is why prices of Bitcoin won\u2019t rise immediately after halving contrary to what many speculators believe.\nHe is of the view that long term Bitcoin prices should rise.\nMatanovic adds:\n \u201cWe will have 75 new bitcoins each hour compared to 150 we have now. So, if the demand keeps rising at the similar rate it has been rising lately, the new supply rate won't be enough to keep the balance and it will push the price up.\u201d \nPrice increase with sharp falls\nDavid Duccini, Strength in Numbers Foundation, says to Cointelegraph:", "birthday": "2016-05-05T12:50:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-05 11:50:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 5}

It is from the word \u2018emergence\u2019 \u2014 signifying the emergence of new properties in the system, more than the sum of its components. This is fusion, synthesis, evolution.\u201d \nAs a leader in blockchain-based network security solutions, and worldwide Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Emercoin has focused on three areas they feel they can add the most value: the workings of the Internet, online advertising and legal verification practices.\n\nMaking distributed Internet possible\nIn a centralized world, Domain Name System (DNS), Secure Shell (SSH) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) services are often offered by default by domain name registries or hosting companies. They all offer pretty much the same features and weaknesses. Despite many hosting and domain companies being well-guarded from an IT perspective, they are still subject to DDOS attacks and even governmental influence. For a company operating within a region of the world which might be subject to censorship or attack from hackers, a decentralized platform for a DNS, SSH and SSL is a saving grace.\nThe company HashCoins uses Emer\u2019s emcSSL/emcSSH technologies to manage their distributed mining pools. Even websites blocked by regional governments are able to operate without interruption using the distributed Emercoin DNS systems.\nBlockchain for Legal records and verification\nThe Emer platform claims to offer Digital proof-of-ownership to merchants who are looking for both scalably and to transparently store records of both digital and physical assets on the blockchain.\nFrom a resolution of land title disputes between law offices to licensing associated with anything from streaming video services to anti-virus software subscription, the Emer platform claims the ability to manage these processes. In addition, the verification of these records is much simpler to access and complete using the Emer platform as all records are kept securely and accurately on the blockchain. This can lower costs and the time spent both from a customer perspective and from a lawyer\u2019s perspective, removing the need to deal with physical documents to complete routine transactions.\nBlockchain for advertising\nOne problem for several websites is online advertising, a key source of revenue, and managing payment models with advertisers.\nBoth ContextOne and Advendor use emcLNX as basic technology for their ad-tech businesses which allow them to more efficiently manage contracts between advertisers and publishers and the delivery of traffic or clicks between them. Using decentralized blockchain ledger technology through Emer, the often mysterious space between publisher, advertisers and the middleman has been bridged.\nWith an eye towards innovation, Emer and Emercoin are also looking to use their blockchain technology to move into the area of streaming content online.

They raised several questions about the inconsistencies in his background and story.\nAlarmingly the FT wrote:\n \u201cSteven Wright says that he just wants to be \u201cleft alone\u201d, but reliable sources say that a man using the same name and answering to a very similar physical description hired a team of public relations gurus to stage manage his revelation.\u201d \nTherefore, I think the first good question to ask would be whether the man claiming to be Craig Steven Wright or Craig Wright is even Craig Wright!\nThe pie in the sky\nAs recently as May 2, 2016, Craig Wright revealed himself as Satoshi Nakamoto in a blog post. The BBC, The Economist and GQ Magazine had access to Craig Wright before the blog was published and they claim that they interviewed him and reviewed the documents he presented. Supporting the claims of Craig Wright were Jon Matonis and Gavin Andersen both of whom are members of the Bitcoin Foundation. Jon and Gavin each supported the claims of Dr. Wright as being Satoshi Nakamoto in their blog posts.\nHere is an excerpt from Jon\u2019s blog:\n \u201cDuring the London proof sessions, I had the opportunity to review the relevant data along three distinct lines: cryptographic, social, and technical. Based on what I witnessed, it is my firm belief that Craig Steven Wright satisfies all three categories. For cryptographic proof in my presence, Craig signed and verified a message using the private key from block #1 newly-generated coins and from block #9 newly-generated coins (the first transaction to Hal Finney). The social evidence, including his unique personality, early emails that I received, and early drafts of the Bitcoin white paper, points to Craig as the creator.\u201d \nHere is one from Gavin\u2019s blog:\n \u201cI was flown to London to meet Dr. Wright a couple of weeks ago, after an initial email conversation convinced me that there was a very good chance he was the same person I\u2019d communicated with in 2010 and early 2011.

Now it is way ahead of its category in terms of merchant adoption, thanks to an aggressively development strategy.\nAs a result, the relatively unknown cryptocurrency, ranked #76 on coinmarketcap.com, is able to claim an impressive 55 merchants that accept it as payment. Additionally, because of the Nocks\u00a0mobile payment system\u2019s seamless transfers, users are able to spend Gulden anywhere Bitcoin is accepted.\nCointelegraph spoke to Rijk Plasman, founder of Gulden, about the cryptocurrency\u2019s ease-of-use-first approach to development.\nCommon man\u2019s currency\nCointelegraph: What prompted the creation of Gulden? What great need were you seeking to fill?\nRijk Plasman: Bitcoin is not used by the common man, at least here in the Netherlands it isn't. I believe that's because it's too complicated to use. We change that. Also Gulden is something people know and miss, by using that name we make crypto friendlier. \u201cHey, Gulden, I know that. Oh is it digital now? Cool.\u201d We received a lot of responses like that. And the unexpected effect in other countries is that is sounds like Golden. We started with a focus on just the Netherlands but soon that changed because we got users from all over the world.\nCT: How does the currency itself, and its distribution method, differ from Bitcoin?\nRP: We have a lot more supply and our block reward doesn't halve. We did that to reach 1 euro = 1 Gulden in a few years. Of course we can't predict that but Bitcoins supply wouldn't be enough for the Netherlands. Technically there are many differences. We developed our own diff algo called DELTA. It smoothens the block times and makes mining fairer. We've introduced PRIME, a system that allows 0 confirms and 51% attack prevention. PRIME is currently being developed and funded by our community. PRIME is very important for our merchants and adoption. We need to be realistic about getting more merchants. We can't tell bigger companies to wait for 5/10 confirmations. So 0 confirms is a must.\nUser experience a priority\nCT: How is it less complicated to use than Bitcoin?\nRP: The user experience is very important to us, we focus a lot on that. Our recently launched iOS and Android apps are very simplistic and anyone can use it without a manual, but that's just the first step. In the coming months it will be even simpler. All the stuff that raises questions when people are introduced with crypto we will make easier. Our competition is not crypto, it\u2019s fiat. And if you look at fiat apps, we have to be better than that. For example, we have our own takeway.com in the netherlands called thuisbezorgd. They accept Bitcoin and not yet Gulden, but because we added the Bitcoin payment functionality, people can pay with Gulden at Thuisbezorgd in a seamless way. And people like it, they tweet about it \u201cHey I ordered my food at thuisbezorgd and paid with Gulden.\u201d Make payments easy and fun, people want to use it, tell their friends about it, without having to know the technical details. At this moment with crypto it all starts with the technical details, stuff most people don't understand and scares them away.\nCT: So is it fair to say you went for a more human approach rather than catering to \"nerds\"?\nRP: Absolutely, but with our development we are still interesting for the\u201dnerds.\u201d We have \u201cnerds\u201d in our team, but I am a UX designer. Still a nerd though, haha. But yeah, human approach, but more importantly a realistic approach. We've spend a lot of time talking with our merchants about the tools they need to accept Gulden.\n\nCT: You mentioned being able to use Gulden where Bitcoin is accepted. How is that possible?\nRP: Through Nocks.co. We work closely with Nocks and they are the first Gulden blockchain based company. They instantly convert Bitcoin/euro to Gulden. We integrated that functionality into our mobile apps (iOS/Android), but seamlessly, so users won't even know they use Nocks for Bitcoin payments. Nocks is extremely fast growing and getting a lot of attention here in the Netherlands in the fintech scene.

This is due to several factors.\nPower problems\n\u201cI don't think anyone's doing any mining,\u201d says Tim Akinbo, CEO of Nigeria-based TimbaObjects to Cointelegraph. \u201cNot with the power situation in the country.

Some have bought mining shares on cloud mining services, or giga hashpowers on CEX.io. That's some of the feedback I've received.

Robert Genito of Wall of Coins thinks peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchanges could revolutionize the cross-border remittance industry.\nCross-border remittances to friends and family account for a significant chunk of economic activity, especially among undocumented immigrants.\nThe undocumented living in the United States sent an estimated $26 billion in 2014 to Mexico alone, underscoring the high demand for a method of transferring wealth internationally with as little paperwork involved as possible.\nWhat is Wall of Coins\nWall of Coins, a service for the peer-to-peer private trading of Bitcoin, has the ability to provide an extremely cheap and simple form of remittances.\nThe functionality of Wall of Coins involves matching Bitcoin buyers and sellers securely and anonymously.\nA seller signs up with their bank and account number (or even MoneyGram account), as well as an SMS-capable phone. The seller then sets a rate and sends Bitcoin into an escrow account.\nA buyers can then deposit money into the seller\u2019s bank account. Once the deposit is confirmed, the Bitcoin is released to the buyer. All this is done privately, with individual buyers and sellers never directly interacting or identified.\nWhat this effectively means is anyone with a mobile phone and a bank/MoneyGram account can receive Bitcoin from anywhere in the world and have it show up as local currency in their account.\nWall of Coins recently expanded support the United Kingdom and Mexico, the latter of which profits enormously from remittances.\nCryptocurrency and remittances in Latin America\nCointelegraph spoke with Robert Genito, CEO of Genitrust and owner of Wall of Coins, about the potential for peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading to act as a revolutionary remittance method, as well as cryptocurrency\u2019s usefulness in cross-border transactions\nCointelegraph: How big are remittances in Latin America?\nRobert Genito: Good question...I don't know about Latin America itself. Apparently the remittance industry itself is a $500 billion industry. Half a trillion! \u201cMoney\u201d is one of the top tools in our society.\nCT: Why does cryptocurrency make sense from a remittance angle? As in, why do it through cryptocurrency, and not just services like Western Union?\nRG: Crypto is direct, it doesn't have store hours, and it's private. The privacy is good if you're concerned about getting robbed with cash on you, or if you or a friend has ever been a victim of police profiling to civil asset forfeiture. Crypto cuts out a lot of work for one sending money and the one receiving money.\nWasn't there a story of a Mexican guy who saved up all of his money in the USA, and when he went back to Mexico, all of his money was confiscated? That's a huge bummer. When you're using cryptocurrency as a tool, you can effortlessly eliminate that possibility.\n\nFees and transaction times\nCT: Wall of Coins recently started functionality in Mexico. If I understand that correctly, does that mean anyone can sell Bitcoin and have the funds show up in a Mexican bank account?\nRG: And anyone anywhere (just like the nature of Bitcoin itself) can send Bitcoin to their relatives' advertisement, which basically sends cash to their bank account, cash account, store credit account, whichever.\nCT: That sounds seamless compared with traditional remittance services like Western Union. How do the fees and transaction times match up?\nRG: There's no clear cut answer yet, I'll be honest. only our data will tell over time, where we can say, \"If 10% of these lowest priced sales were for remittance purposes\", etc. Keep in mind: Wall of Coins does NOT market itself as a remittance company.\nHowever, that only inspires the entrepreneur [reader] who wants to market their own website and leverage our business by using our business interface for the entrepreneur's developers (our \"API\").\nWhat I'm saying is here are the possibilities when using Wall of Coins as a remittance:\n The person you send money to could end up with more value than they started The person you send money to can willingly receive more value than the original amount. If you get paid in Bitcoin for your work, you already have 0 fees. \n\"How do transaction times match up?\" I will bet that one day the transaction times will be just as fast.

He said the continent of over a billion people has been underserved by financial institutions for such a long time.\nFactors for Bitcoin use growth in Africa\nSome of the factors he cited in this regard are the high cost of financial infrastructure, high fees compared to the average earnings, high cost of having a physical presence like ATMs, bank branches and remittance offices.\nTo cap it all, he noted that there's been a lot of talk in finance of \"the next billion\" and a big part of this next billion will come out of Africa.\nToday, Africa has continued to wake up to some of the reality of using the digital currency particularly with the high mobile phone penetration already in place to enable more users in Africa to download a Bitcoin wallet on their devices.\nThree other components which have also assisted Bitcoin use in Africa: growing number of exchange companies like BitX which have been working to engage with the public and government regulators to increase adaption; increase in developers to build more innovative products and uses for Bitcoin (like integration with physical and online stores); and getting more people to start using it as a means of transacting.\u00a0\n\nBitcoin use cases in Africa\nBut in which ways has Bitcoin use manifested across the continent to be a sought-after currency among the people? Here are four of them:\n1. Remittance\nTop of the list of what Bitcoin is primarily used for in Africa is for remittance purposes.\nThough the African remittances which flow to and within the continent are officially pegged at $40 billion per year by the International\u00a0Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD), industry insiders say this figure amounts to just a third or fourth of the actual amount transacted as most transfers are conducted via informal means.\nCoupled with high remittance charges \u2013 the World Bank says Sub-Saharan Africa remains the highest cost region with an average cost of 9.5 percent - these have created inconveniences which discourage the movement of funds through known official means such as financial institutions.\nThis is due partly to the blockades created by the lack of adequate facilities in parts of Africa to enhance the transfer and exchange of funds across borders without any form of restriction on such transactions.\nIt also helps solve import and export payment challenges and overcome currency liquidity constraints in Nigeria.\nNow, Africans are reaching out to Bitcoin, particularly for its low value payments since there isn't a fixed minimum fee which gets charged to send money for a transaction either to the person sitting next to them, to a business or to a peer-to-peer on the other side of the world.\u00a0\n2. Crowdfunding\u00a0\nDue to its anonymous nature the next main use of Bitcoin in Africa is to source funds to support humanitarian efforts .\nTo help ensure that safe and reliable water is provided across Kenya, for example, The Water Project launched a new initiative which last year sought Bitcoin donations to fund new sensor-enabled water projects in the country. \u00a0An appeal was launched for Bitcoin donations to Botswana's SOS Children's Villages in 2014.\nGlobally, the charity sector has been touted to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the financial services sector\u2019s investigation into the new technology.\nWith the experimental phases being conducted by international organizations such as Unicef with its unicoin donations, and African crowdfunding platforms such as Bankymoon and Usuzi which accept Bitcoin, the appeal now is for global support for a cause based on its potential convenience to a wider audience.\u00a0\nSouth African startup, The Sun Exchange, for example, seeks to scale up its marketplace which crowdfunds small-scale solar projects using digital currencies such as Bitcoin.\nAs with remittances, it appears that these two uses will remain at the top of Bitcoin use in Africa. The freedom, openness and ease of use which Bitcoin provides are yet unrivaled and are not likely to go away soon.\nAs such, it shows that Bitcoin use is gaining acceptance and venturing into new aspects of life across a mobile phone-led African context.\u00a0\u00a0\n3. Tech startups adaptation\nIn the tech sector in Kenya, coupled with East Africa's powerhouse economy and a developed ICT hub for the region, the digital currency BitPesa startup has cashed in on the growing success of the mobile money sector in the country.\nM-pesa recorded a huge success which has stretched beyond Africa, thus highlighting an opportunity which made Bitpesa become the first Bitcoin startup based in Africa to receive VC funding. Other Bitcoin enthusiasts are also pushing for its adoption and trying to create more awareness of the need to adopt policies around digital currencies.\nThen along comes Bitsoko with its Android mobile wallet. What this shows is that the exponential growth in startups across Africa has been fuelling the integration of Bitcoin as a form of payment by online markets to avoid damaging financial security issues.", "birthday": "2016-04-30T15:15:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-30 14:15:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 30}

Yet, as simple as that goal may appear, creating an index for a decentralized, globally used and traded cryptocurrency, involves substantial forethought and ingenuity, especially to travel from selfless dedication to an unparalleled index architecture.\nIt also looks as if BitcoinAverage is poised to sustain itself as the industry frontrunner and secure the status as the de facto index choice for Bitcoin users, traders, investors and more.\n\nEvolving system\nBitcoinAverage as an aggregated Bitcoin price index was launched in August 2013.\nGilchrist explained that he initially wanted to know the difference in markets to better gauge potential profits for off-exchange trading and the brokering of trades, which was taking off in the U.K. around that time.\nAfter successfully creating a simple script in 2012 to compare the premium of the British Pound market to the US dollar, Gilchrist recognized the data may be well received by others.\nThe price index was soon released as an open source and the journey of BitcoinAverage began, with thousands of monthly users soon taking to the earliest iteration of the system.\nIn his claims, Gilchrist says that the company\u2019s data extends as far back as 2010, encompassing a volume that surpasses key competitors.\nBut it\u2019s not just breadth and back-end programming. The index is also highly approachable, as it is comprehensive, from a front-end user perspective.\nGilchrist says:\n \u201cThe layout has grown into a less clunky interface than other indices. The display contains legible data with an adequate colour contrast important for those that spend hours researching and analyzing data in single sittings.\u201d \nFiat and cryptocurrency\nFurthermore, the currency and commodity options abound. Including USD, EUR, CNY, GBP and CAD options, the global index consists of over 165 currencies to Gilchrist\u2019s estimation.\nThe wide accessibility to fiat currencies and commodities provides an additional layer of relevance on a global scale, especially important for a cryptocurrency that extends beyond any one set of borders.\nThere were some initial pains, however, and to some extent those same inflictions remain today.\nGilchrist says:\n \u201cIn the early days [we] were coping with the frequent issues with exchanges, their API\u2019s uptimes, and the fact that one could just disappear overnight.\u201d \nThough his experience of the volatile nature of the industry, Gilchrist labelled as necessary learning curves and asserts adaptation to market conditions as continuous endeavours for the London-based index.\nBitcoinAverage fees\nThe current BitcoinAverage system does not address 0% fee exchanges. Gilchrist claims that the company is working on it.\nHe attaches the reason for the current situation to the fact that users can trade on the exchange for free with an unlimited base on a very tiny spread.\nThe increased volume, sometimes exponentially, can skew the average on a weighted average price which is what BitcoinAverage currently supplies.\n \u201cWe have rewritten our whole backend from scratch,\u201d said Gilchrist. \u201cA major decision for any software provider.\u201d \nComprehensive Bitcoin price index\nKostinuk observes that the upcoming launch of the BitcoinAverage latest API, which has recently been released in a closed beta to allow testing and feedback before product finalization, means BitcoinAverage is closing in on its next evolutionary step: Scalability for the needs of enterprise.\nThe claim is that the new interface will be bundled with an updated front-end, offering customization and tailored programming to provide real-time, by-the-second updates, data points from exchanges all over the world, and the capability to adapt and adjust those indices to even the most idiosyncratic needs.\nThe changes underway are expected to usher in the most advanced, comprehensive Bitcoin price index to date with pioneering features that push the system well beyond capabilities of competitor indices.\u00a0\nHooked on potential\nPotential is the key word. It speaks to the core necessity of a pricing index, for Bitcoin or any other commodity.\nGilchrist says:\n \u201cI have been a \u2018bitcoiner\u2019 myself since 2010. It was mentioned to me by a developer, and from the first few weeks of research, toying with mining, et cetera, I was hooked on its potential.\u201d \nThe cryptocurrency, while commanding over USD $6 billion in market capitalization today, is a young asset class.\nAnd granted stability in price has existed in recent months, since January, the cryptocurrency remains subject to volatility for a myriad of factors, in particular, the gradual rate of adoption and its perceived store of value, which is tantamount to its consideration over gold-backed fiat currencies.\nFees, rates and policies\nFurther complicating the asset class is the range of exchanges worldwide, which involves a unique array of fees, rates and policies \u2014 perhaps shaped by the country the exchange is based in \u2014 that, in the end, can affect the bottom-line for users, traders or investors.\nThis is where the core value of a system like BitcoinAverage\u2019s shines through.\nSupplying a weighted average that incorporates over four dozen of the world\u2019s exchanges, with 0% fee exchanges soon to be included, access to the widest variety of currency markets available among indices, there\u2019s no better method of gauging the potential swings of the prone-to-volatility cryptocurrency.\nAnd with billions of dollars at stake, such a system is invaluable.", "birthday": "2016-04-30T17:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-30 16:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 30}

Is that an accurate sentiment?\nAlexander Vityaz: Yes, that is correct - because of compliance, KYC, AML. PrivatBank doesn't work with Bitcoin directly. We use blockchain technology (Bitcoin digital signature - \u00a0public and private keys) to sign financial documents, transactions, and even for encrypting traffic in mobile app.\nCT: What prompted PrivatBank to be different in that regard?\nAV: What prompted us? We wanted to spearhead this movement. Curiosity prompted us. We always wanted to be #1. For example, the first p2p card to card transaction we did in 2003 (!) in partnership with Visa.\nCT: Many in the cryptocurrency community think that Bitcoin and blockchain technology will be the end of banks as we know them today. Do you share that sentiment?\nAV: In brief, we don't share this sentiment. These two technologies will coexist. Banks will become credit brokers, and Visa will deeply learn how to use Bitcoin and blockchain.\nAs I\u2019ve said before, Bitcoin is not a competitor for VISA, as VISA now isn\u2019t the same as VISA back when PayPal emerged. It will research, integrate, and keep its finger on the pulse. In fact, it will most likely be a kind of co-evolution rather than confrontation.\u201d\n\nRole of banks will diminish\nCT: The use of cryptocurrency allows many of the unbanked to receive the same benefits as using a bank, without the cost or difficult setup. Do you think that would reduce the role of banking for the everyday citizen? Or would it have no serious effect? Or, will the role of traditional banks diminish, but for a different reason?\nAV: We will not have a situation: \u201ceither Bitcoin or banking.\u201d It'll be \u201cboth.\u201d The role of banks as technology companies will diminish, they will concentrate on money brokerage - as they were doing this hundreds years ago.\nBitcoin as it is today is rather hard for common citizens to use. Plastic card is much more simple product. What will really happen is that banking functions (from the point of view of technology) will gravitate away from banks towards global payment systems, such as Visa, MasterCard and towards Bitcoin technology.\nAs I\u2019ve said: \u201cTheoretically, defragmentation of a super-fragmented system (there are 30,000 banks in the world) is possible with two systems only, vertical or horizontal, namely payment systems or Bitcoin respectively.\u201d\nBeing decentralized Bitcoin irritates a lot of banks\nCT: Do you see any banks unwilling to accept this new, more limited role in the world financial system?\nAV: All the banks are not willing to accept this. But it's temporary, because they don't understand what's going on. As soon as they realize that they don't have to become IT-companies, banks will accept their new role.", "birthday": "2016-05-01T11:52:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-01 10:52:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 1}

She also mentioned that establishment of the partnership similar to R3 would allow Russian financial institutions to work around the technology more efficiently and with lower costs.\nTaking maximum of blockchain technology\nSeveral examples of the application of blockchain technology were demonstrated at the Forum.\nThe major Russian Bank, Sberbank Rossii, launched a pilot project in December 2015, which implied testing the potential of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain in issuance of power of attorney, its revision, evaluation and the processing of invoices.\nEkaterina Frolovicheva, Chief Executive of the Center for Technological Innovation of Sberbank, says:\n \u201cWe will be able to draw conclusions about the long-term potential of the project in about a year.\u201d \nWhile working on this project, several other possible options for the application of blockchain were identified, which need more studying.\nThe National Settlement Depository (NSD) which offers a wide range of services, from clearance and custody service, ex-pit transactions registering (repository), informational services, to collateral management, \u00a0has also been working on a pilot project in cooperation with DSX Technologies. They have announced that they have successfully finished developing and testing an e-proxy voting system running on a distributed ledger (blockchain technology). The prototype is based on the NXT distributed cryptographic platform and uses ISO 20022 international standard for messaging. The project\u2019s open source code can be found on GitHub.\nAs Artyom Duvanov, Chief Architect at NDS, says:\n \u201cWe have finalised development and successfully tested blockchain-based E-proxy voting electronic voting system prototype. However, it is still too early to talk about its application in practice, even though it is totally operationable. Implementation of E-proxy voting would require certain changes in legislation.\u201d \nWhat is E-proxy voting?\nE-proxy voting is an innovative technology for corporate actions processing that provides for electronic interaction between securities holders and issuers for the purpose of exchanging information and documents. The system was first implemented at the NSD in August 2014. In April 2015, NSD significantly improved the technology bringing it into compliance with ISO standards. In April 2016, an e-proxy voting system prototype was tested for bondholder meetings.\nEddie Astanin, Chairman of the Executive Board at NSD, says:\n \"Over the past 10 years, the global financial infrastructure has faced the challenges which make us review the approaches to reliability, security and performance of information systems. It is obvious for us that ignoring the rapid development of FinTech and upgrading the outdated platforms could hinder the stable development of the Russian financial system. Fortunately, Russian specialists are among the most experienced in the global FinTech industry, and we have proven this fact by implementing a fully functional prototype of an e-proxy voting system based on blockchain. After testing blockchain for bondholder meetings, we can extend the use of this technology to other business areas of NSD.\" \n", "birthday": "2016-05-02T13:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-02 12:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 2}

Alternative Cryptocurrencies Make Gains Against Bitcoin ", "content": "Bitcoin has long held a firm lead in the cryptocurrency world. However, this advantage has become diminished over the years as more altcoins have made gains in distribution, value, and adoption. Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization percentage, well over 90% for 2013, has since declined to 82% after having reached an all-time low of 74% in March. Altcoins\u2019 percentage of trading volume is also at an all-time high.\nHowever, market capitalization and trading volume only tell half the story, ignoring adoption and acceptance by merchants. Cointelegraph spoke to several developers and representatives of alternative cryptocurrencies about the changing landscape of cryptocurrency adoption.\nBitcoin\u2019s limitations\nWhile Bitcoin has earned its place at the head of the cryptocurrency movement, it has reached certain limitations, according to Dash developer Moocowmoo.\n \u201cBitcoin is amazing technology and has an extremely powerful network securing it, but because of it's social and financial inertia it cannot incorporate some of the technologies created since its inception. The resistance to adopting more modern techniques is a complex social issue, as recently illustrated by the block size debate.\u201d \nMoocowmoo noted Bitcoin\u2019s mining issues due to hashrate changes, \u201crecently, blocks 401410 and 402456 took 90 minutes to discover.\u201d Hlynur \u00de\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rnsson, board member of the Auroracoin Foundation, notes Bitcoin\u2019s place in the cryptocurrency world, but underscores the need for alternatives.\n \u201cI believe that we will always have Bitcoin as the backbone of the crypto market, something like USD works for the global economy and gold was before the USD. For crypto to become the standard, I'm sure we will need many altcoins and not just Bitcoin to cover and service small or large economies. Each economy will have to have the flexibility to devalue or appreciate if there are changes in the local economy.\u201d \nDash\nRecently, Dash has made inroads into merchant adoption, debuting a WooCommerce plugin, as well as a functioning vending machine to showcase InstantX instant zero-confirmation transactions. Currently, a reported 52 merchants worldwide accept payments in Dash.\nAs an example of other cryptocurrencies\u2019 potential competitive advantage over Bitcoin, Moocowmoo mentions how Dash solved a declining node count issue.\n \u201cLast summer there were concerns about the declining Bitcoin node count. Dash's collateralized nodes create incentive to support network health by financially rewarding participants which provide well maintained, highly available nodes. While it is technically possible for Bitcoin to adopt a similar model, the Bitcoin mining community would likely reject splitting their block rewards to support it.\u201d \nMoocowmoo underscored the ability of alternative cryptocurrencies to rise above niche functionality to stand on their own.\n \u201cAs users discover the limitations of the Bitcoin network that apply to their particular use cases, they will look for alternatives that address their needs. Over time, I'm sure the utility of these ecosystems will stand on their own merits.\u201d \nAuroracoin\nIcelandic cryptocurrency Auroracoin, already in the hands of 10% of Iceland\u2019s population, is making a comeback, debuting bus stop advertisements across the island nation while preparing an Auroracoin/kr\u00f3na exchange as well as integration with merchant point-of-sale systems.\nGudmundur Loeve, member of the Aurar\u00e1\u00f0 Foundation, rejects the idea of Bitcoin maintaining and strengthening its dominance.\n \u201cIt\u2019s contrary the very nature of the free flow of information and technology to assume that the monetary world will somehow stagnate into a centralized, standardized marketplace dominated by a single currency.\u201d ", "birthday": "2016-05-02T16:50:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-02 15:50:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 2}

Has Bitcoin finally come of age in the land of the rising sun?\nOn March 4, 2016, The Japan Times\u00a0reported that the Cabinet in Japan had approved a series of bills which would help the banking sector expand their reach when it comes to Information Technology businesses. This intertwining of banking and IT are called \u2018FinTech\u2019 in emerging parlance.\nInterestingly, the cabinet also takes into stock the rising importance of virtual currencies and the new bills will recognize them as a means of making payments and having the potential to be digitally transferred.\nJapan has just given virtual currencies legitimacy, something that many other nations are still struggling to come to terms with.\nSo Saito, Attorney at Law who specialises in Virtual Currencies, says to Cointelegraph:\n \"I think that new law will advance an acceptance of Bitcoin and other VC. Some of major financial institutions, investors, and advertising agencies etc. have hesitated being relevant with Bitcoin. The reasons are that Bitcoin is not regulated, the nature of it has been uncertain and some still have a bad impression on Bitcoin.\" \nSunrise for Bitcoin in the land of the rising sun?\nThe government in Japan is attempting to bring virtual currencies under the purview of the Financial Services Agency (FSA), the same Japanese agency which manages transactions that take place in Japan\u2019s own currency, the Yen. This will also mean that there would registeration of exchanges which handle virtual currencies aimed at preventing money laundering and extending more protection to the people who use Bitcoin and other such currencies.\nKagayaki (Kaga) Kawabata, Business Development Lead at Coincheck.com, says to Cointelegraph about these developments:\n \u201cWe believe this movement is positive for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies communities. Since the Mt. Gox incident, the majority of people in Japan didn't trust Bitcoin thinking that Mt. Gox was Bitcoin. People thought Bitcoin was money used for fraudulent activities. Legally accepting Bitcoin as similar to fiat money will change how people perceive Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. This government's move has a huge impact in helping Bitcoin to be acknowledged by the general public and will speed up an integration of Bitcoin by other businesses. Also, since Japan is one of the first countries to treat the Bitcoin as fiat money it is of major importance. It will be a great opportunity for Japan to show that they are actively pursuing innovative technology \u00a0throughout the country.\u201d \nHowever, Takao Asayama, CEO of Tech Bureau Corp (Zaif Exchange), strikes a cautious note and says:\n \u201cJapan considers whole virtual currencies, including cryptos, as \"circulation\". \u00a0It's an extension of payment method. \u00a0The law requires certain capitalization and registration at the FSA, and forces segregated management of deposits to exchanges. However, it is not fully pictured how cryptocurrencies can be segregated and audited. \u00a0The good part of this new law is that we can wipe off most of the fraudulent \"HYIP coin schemes\" but I am afraid that it will also eliminate small tech startups benefiting from crypto technologies.\u201d \n\nBringing Information Technology to Banking\nThe banking sector in Japan would benefit the most from the proposed laws. Already the banks in Japan are more open-minded about Bitcoin than their European peers who seem to shut the doors to people who are active participants in the crypto world.\nJeremy Wood, Co-founder and CSO of Input Output, a company which operates in Hong Kong and Japan, says:\n \u201cI think in some respects, the banks have already accepted Bitcoin. Japan doesn\u2019t have the bank closings that happen to Bitcoin companies.\u201d \nSo are the Japanese banks ready to take a huge leap of faith and start embracing Bitcoin?\nTakao Asayama of Tech Bureau Corp (Zaif Exchange) thinks so and told us that things started changing in January 2016 because before that in 2015 virtual currencies were, in his words, \u201cVoldemort\u201d to the banks in Japan. He says that in January 2016, Japanese banks started running experiments and started talking about cryptocurrencies with \u201csmiles\u201d to the media. Takao is of the view that they are getting ready to adopt it as a part of business when the law comes into force next year.\nKaga of Coincheck.jp also chimes in with his view that since the announcement banks are showing an interest in Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. He thinks this would mean more opportunities for established Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges. However, he feels that due to increased regulations startups might face more difficulty in entering the market.\nWomen may play a key role in Bitcoin adoption in Japan\nJapan is unique in the world of personal finance since many financial decisions are taken by the women of the household. It is well known that many men receive a fixed allowance from their wives, who are mostly homemakers. This allowance is known as okozukai and while men can entertain themselves with this money, they mostly have little say in the household finances. Japanese women are considered the money managers and investment wizards. In an environment where interest rates are zero and sub-zero, the Japanese housewife is on the look-out for new and interesting investment options.\nIn fact, Jeremy Wood\u2019s, Co-founder of Input Output, Japanese wife\u2019s inquisitiveness about Bitcoin took him by surprise.\nHe says to Cointelegraph:", "birthday": "2016-05-02T11:30:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-02 10:30:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 2}

But Cointelegraph\u2019s Andrew Quenston doesn\u2019t buy that, and claims to have \u00a0evidence to the contrary.\nWhen the community has learned that Craig Wright, an entrepreneur from Australia claims he was Satoshi Nakamoto, the legendary author of Bitcoin\u2019s whitepaper and protocol, people started taking sides on the issue. Many believe the evidence provided by Wright. The claim was made stronger by Gavin Andersen, one of the core Bitcoin developers, who commented:\n \u201cI was flown to London to meet Dr. Wright a couple of weeks ago, after an initial email conversation convinced me that there was a very good chance he was the same person I\u2019d communicated with in 2010 and early 2011. After spending time with him I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt: Craig Wright is Satoshi.\u201d \nHowever, others, Cointelegraph\u2019s Andrew Quenston included, have provided evidence to support the contrary point of view, that Wright is not Satoshi.\nToday, Cointelegraph has decided to reduce speculation to the minimum and take a look at hard facts. We have thoroughly analyzed the evidence which, as Wright alleges, proves him to be Satoshi, and here are the results of that analysis:\n1. Craig took the number 9 block from Bitcoin blockchain, which was mined on January 9, 2009.\n2. Then he took its coinbase transaction, i.e. the mining transaction which created 50 new bitcoins and credited it to the adress\n 12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S \nThe hash of that transaction is\n 0437cd7f8525ceed2324359c2d0ba26006d92d856a9c20fa0241106ee5a597c9 \n3. That transaction was sent to the following address:\n12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S which corresponds to the following public key:\n 0411db93e1dcdb8a016b49840f8c53bc1eb68a382e97b1482ecad7b148a6909a5cb2e0eaddfb84ccf9744464f82e160bfa9b8b64f9d4c03f999b8643f656b412a3 \n4. Thus we have the public key starting with 0411.. which has to have a specific corresponding private key. The latter should only be known by the owner of that wallet - namely, Satoshi, because it\u2019s one of the very first wallets in the Bitcoin network.\n5. Now let\u2019s find any single case of use of that private key. Obviously, that would be any transaction which spends the outputs of the wallet starting with 12cb\u2026 Check the output script here.\nWe can see every transaction which was sent from that wallet here.\n6. Among them, Craig has picked a transaction with the following hash -\u00a0\n 828ef3b079f9c23829c56fe86e85b4a69d9e06e5b54ea597eef5fb3ffef509fe. \n7. In that transaction we can see that out of the 28btc worth of outputs, 10btc was sent to the following address:\n 1ByLSV2gLRcuqUmfdYcpPQH8Npm8cccsFg. \nAnd 18btc worth of change was returned to the 12cb\u2026 wallet\nIn that transaction, we can see the following signature\n 3045022100c12a7d54972f26d14cb311339b5122f8c187417dde1e8efb6841f55c34220ae0022066632c5cd4161efa3a2837764eee9eb84975dd54c2de2865e9752585c53e7cce01 \n8. According to the Bitcoin protocol, this signature 3045\u2026 is derived from the algorithm specified here.\nAccording to the algorithm, we have to take the transaction\u00a0, modify it slightly (extracting the transaction body as a result), apply the hashing procedure twice and use the resulting data as an input for the signature algorithm.\n9. Thus, the signature 3045\u2026 = ECDSA(sha(sha(transaction body))\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that the transaction body is known by everyone, or, rather, it is derived from public data. Roughly, it contains the address to which sender transfers money to.\n10. Then Craig follows the algorithm mentioned in stage 8 (except for the last step when the data is signed) applying it to transaction\u00a0828ef...\u00a0The steps are the following:\n10.1. Request the raw transaction 828e...\n bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction 828ef3b079f9c23829c56fe86e85b4a69d9e06e5b54ea597eef5fb3ffef509fe  \nThe result:\n 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 \n10.2. The transaction 828ef3b079f9c23829c56fe86e85b4a69d9e06e5b54ea597eef5fb3ffef509fe spends the first output of this transaction:\n 12b5633bad1f9c167d523ad1aa1947b2732a865bf5414eab2f9e5ae5d5c191ba. \nThen we take the script for this output:\u00a0\n 0411db93e1dcdb8a016b49840f8c53bc1eb68a382e97b1482ecad7b148a6909a5cb2e0eaddfb84ccf9744464f82e160bfa9b8b64f9d4c03f999b8643f656b412a3 \n10.3.

Then we attach the hashcode (in our case it\u2019s 01000000) to the end of that data\nThe result:\n 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 \nThat string is the body of our transaction, ready to be signed.\n11. After that, Craig took the transaction body we\u2019ve got after the stage #10 and ran it through SHA one time, instead of two.\u00a0He got this:\u00a0\n 479f9dff0155c045da78402177855fdb4f0f396dc0d2c24f7376dd56e2e68b05 \nWhich he has posted on his website.\nAfter that it\u2019s all smoke and mirrors:\n12. Craig has put the body of the transaction derived above into a new file named sn7-message.txt and posted it in his article. Naturally, if we calculate the hashsum of that file, it will be the same:\n 479f9dff0155c045da78402177855fdb4f0f396dc0d2c24f7376dd56e2e68b05 \n13. And, seemingly to prove the fact that he owns the private key we\u2019ve mentioned under point #5, he mentions the fact that 3045...\n = ECDSA(sha(479f9dff0155c045da78402177855fdb4f0f396dc0d2c24f7376dd56e2e68b05)) \nWhich is indeed the key, at least judging by its structure. However, it has nothing to do with the original 12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S address and doesn't prove that Craig owns the private keys of that address.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the following string:\n MEUCIQDBKn1Uly8m0UyzETObUSL4wYdBfd4ejvtoQfVcNCIK4AIgZmMsXNQWHvo6KDd2Tu6euEl13VTC3ihl6XUlhcU+fM4= \nIs actually another string, encoded via Base64:\n 3045022100c12a7d54972f26d14cb311339b5122f8c187417dde1e8efb6841f55c34220ae0022066632c5cd4161efa3a2837764eee9eb84975dd54c2de2865e9752585c53e7cce \nThus, even though Craig\u2019s article contained certain technical data, which could mislead the readers, it does not prove that Craig owns Satoshi\u2019s private keys. What\u2019s more, we could apply the very same process to another transaction to generate a similar \u201cproof\u201d. Let\u2019s apply the logic above to a completely different transaction:\n1. Take the 286 block.\n2. Take its coinbase transaction\n 00ff9e64c9a2e7793e6f8c2b04072b4b22648cdedd46cd1c3ae3d6a23c8ec1eb. \n3. That transaction sends the reward to the following address: 1Jhk2DHosaaZx1E4CbnTGcKM7FC88YHYv9.\nThat address has the following public key:\n 048b48e109f432a490522f8d0e9e833443809f65b8aa2558b94c1c15eb0fd3e24f32d58a088a2b0e5e694d05e7b981e5c9750827646eb81debc816c3c667eea5fd \nWhich can be checked here.\n4. Take all transactions for the following address\n 1Jhk2DHosaaZx1E4CbnTGcKM7FC88YHYv9. \n5. There is just one transaction which spends money from that address:\n d71fd2f64c0b34465b7518d240c00e83f6a5b10138a7079d1252858fe7e6b577. \nHence, that transaction is signed by a private key, corresponding to that same address:\n 1Jhk2DHosaaZx1E4CbnTGcKM7FC88YHYv9. \n6.

One such person is Evan Duffield.\u201d \nThe importance of anonymity\nWith a background in both software development and finance, Duffield was captivated by Bitcoin from its earliest days. He was particularly intrigued by the idea of digital cash: a technology which could replicate the features of physical cash but without the drawbacks inherent to conventional currency.\nDuffield says:\n \u201cI started tinkering with Bitcoin in 2011, really early in its development. I decided I wanted to dive into cryptographic currency and like all things, and the best way for me to learn something new is to either sink or swim.\u201d \nAs he studied Bitcoin more deeply, however, he discovered a weakness in its design: a lack of true anonymity. According to Sammons, some might argue anonymity is only essential for those who wish to engage in illegal activities. But this is not the case. Anonymity is necessary for cash for two reasons.\nFirstly, it gives each transaction privacy, so that no one can pry into the financial transactions of others. Imagine giving public access to everyone\u2019s credit card transactions. Such information, aside from just violating individuals\u2019 privacy, could be used to manipulate people in many ways.\nSecondly, anonymity makes the currency \u201cfungible,\u201d meaning every unit of the currency is worth the same as any other unit. Why is this true? \u00a0If people could track coins to specific people and transactions, efforts could be made to \u201ctaint\u201d coins, for example, if they were previously involved in illegal activities, making them worth less than others.\n\nBitcoin and anonymity\nUnfortunately, Bitcoin does not supply true anonymity; each transaction is broadcast on a public blockchain for anyone to study. True, those transactions are not publicly linked to specific individuals, but with enough forensic research one can draw connections between transactions and individuals.\nDuffield at first wanted to improve anonymity in Bitcoin itself, but he found that his suggestions were not accepted by the core Bitcoin developers. So, in the grand tradition of open source technology, he decided to fork the project and create his own digital coin. He called it \u201cDarkcoin,\u201d reflecting the anonymity of the currency, and released it on January 18, 2014. Calling Darkcoin a \u201cmore private blockchain,\u201d Duffield marketed it as a \u201cprivacy-centric\u201d currency. Thus, a new coin was born.\nThe initial reception was nothing short of remarkable. People quickly realized that Darkcoin solved a real-world digital currency problem, and the price reflected that realization. Users flocked to the coin, and soon its market capitalization was one of the highest of any digital currency. \u00a0\nIn its first year Darkcoin overcame a number of technical hurdles \u2013 inventing a whole new way of implementing money isn\u2019t for the fainthearted \u2013 and became one of the top digital currencies on the market.\nFrom Darkcoin to Dash\nThat\u2019s only the beginning of the story, however. From these humble origins something greater was introduced to the world, perhaps even greater than Duffield himself realized. For the technical solution to implementing an anonymous currency held the seeds to much more.\nDuffield created an incentivized 2nd-tier of nodes (called \u201cMasternodes\u201d), more powerful than regular Bitcoin nodes, which would be the foundation for a whole host of future features, many of which weren\u2019t even considered when Darkcoin was first created. Sammons points out that anyone who has worked in software development knows how important the initial foundation of a project is. Without a robust infrastructure, there are limitations as to what can be accomplished as the project matures.\nSammons says:\n \u201cThis Masternode network became the robust foundation to which more and more features could be added \u2013 features which are not possible for Bitcoin or other coins without a 2nd-tier network of nodes.\u201d \nBy creating a Masternode network, Duffield gave his coin a leg-up in building future features into the coin. Unlike Bitcoin nodes, Masternodes receive payments for their service to the network. Because they are incentivized, more can be demanded of them: more powerful hardware, required software upgrades, etc.\nDuffield notes:\n \u201cI first discovered a way to make a decentralized anonymity engine, something that had never been done before, then I continued to find other new concepts such as decentralized funding, decentralized governance and a decentralized storage engine.\u201d \nAs the project began to include more features, however, the Darkcoin name became a liability instead of a strength. It emphasized only the one aspect of the project \u2013 anonymity \u2013 and not everything it had the potential to become. Further, public perception was that the Darkcoin name referred to its use in illegal activities, which was never the intention of the project.\nAs Duffield noted, \u201cIt became apparent that the Darkcoin branding was getting in our way, so in order to accomplish our greater mission, we decided rebranding was necessary.\u201d \u00a0So the name was changed from Darkcoin to \u201cDash.\u201d \u00a0A shortened form of \u201cdigital cash,\u201d the revised name is a reflection of Duffield\u2019s original vision for the project.\nLooking into the future\nSince its creation, the Dash Masternode network has shown itself capable of handling new features. Over the past two years, the following Dash features have been added:\nInstantX: To solve the problem of lag time in transactions, Masternodes are able to instantly lock transactions.", "birthday": "2016-05-03T10:55:00+01:00", "date": "2016-05-03 09:55:00", "year": 2016, "month": 5, "day": 3}

You would be ecstatic right? Now imagine if someone had a similar fortune stashed in Bitcoin but was never heard from again. It would be a tragedy of epic proportions.\nSatoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic father of Bitcoin has disappeared and his disappearance is an elephant in the room. His last words to the world being \u201cI\u2019ve moved on to other things\u2026\u201d.\nIs Nakamoto San still alive?\nIs he Japanese?\nWhy can\u2019t he spend his massive fortune?\nLet us try to deconstruct one of the most mysterious people in the world.\nWhat\u2019s in a name?\nIf we were to judge a book by the cover, and take his word for what it is, he is a Japanese man.\nSo what about the name Satoshi Nakamoto, which is spelt \u4e2d\u672c\u54f2\u53f2 (Nakamoto Satoshi) in Japanese? We talked with Takaaki Kagawa, BA Literature (Waseda University, Tokyo) and he had this to say about the name our father of Bitcoin has chosen for himself:\n \u201cFirst of all, it sounds like a fairly valid Japanese name. Satoshi is a common male name, and I had a couple of classmates called Satoshi even though the Japanese spellings were different. Nakamoto is a surname which is not everywhere, but it is not uncommon. According to Myoji-Yurai(browsed on the 27th of April, 2016), there are approx. 39,200 people with this surname spelt in this particular way in Japanese.\u201d \nIf indeed Satoshi Nakamoto spells Nakamoto in this particular manner then and is a Japanese living in Japan then we can narrow down the number of people to a smaller pool.\nIf we assume that he told the truth about his age, then we have even a smaller band of people. However we should keep in mind that Nakamoto can also be spelt with other Chinese characters in different ways, namely \u4e2d\u5143, \u4ef2\u672c, or \u4ef2\u5143. So in essence this may just be a wild goose chase if we were to try to locate him with the name alone.\nThe Mysterious Bitcoin Paper\nOn November 1, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto released a paper titled \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u201d. In this paper, he talks about \u201celectronic cash\u201d and the whole framework surrounding the functioning of Bitcoin.\nNakamoto released this paper on a mailing list and included these words, \u201cI've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.\u201d An interesting feature of this paper is the usage of the English plural \u201cwe\u201d. As an example consider this excerpt, \u201cWe define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures.\u201d In old fashioned academic writing it was perfectly acceptable to use the plural to take a distance to what was being written.\nSo we can assume that Satoshi Nakamoto was either trained to write in a particular way or Satoshi Nakamoto was a team of more than one person. Another interesting anomaly in the paper is the usage of the contraction \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d. Here is an example, \u201cHe can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.\u201d\nThis usage of can\u2019t stands out because in academic writing, the usage of contractions is usually frowned upon. The usage of this can\u2019t is in contrast with the usage of we in the paper, which would suggest having some academic training.\nIt would appear Satoshi Nakamoto was perhaps trying to cover up who or whatever they were.", "birthday": "2016-04-27T15:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-27 14:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 27}

The differences, surprisingly, seem minimal.\nA question of \u201ctiming and priority\u201d, says Gavin Andresen, who is of the opinion that Bitcoin should primarily scale on-chain in the short term.\nGregory Maxwell disagrees, stating in a post that \u201cthe decentralized Bitcoin blockchain is probably the most insanely inefficient mode of communication ever devised by man.\u201d\nSome suggest that this may be a narrow view, looking at the code only, rather than its wider effects, such as potentially replacing bank branches or employees. Nonetheless, every node has to store and communicate every transaction.\n\nThe use of layer two systems\nThe idea is to slow down demand on nodes by the use of layer two systems, such as Lightning.\nAccording to Maxwell, from its very beginning Bitcoin was design to incorporate layers in secure ways through its smart contracting capability.\nIn effect we will use the Bitcoin system as a highly accessible and perfectly trustworthy robotic judge and conduct most of our business outside of the court room.\nHe continues by saying that this is possible precisely because of the core properties of Bitcoin.\nA censorable or reversible base system is not very suitable to build powerful upper layer transaction processing on top of and if the underlying asset isn't sound, there is little point in transacting with it at all.\nThings that need fixing\nEric Lombrozo, the main developer of segwit, an important component for Lightning, states in reply to a number of our questions:\n \u201c[W]e don't want to keep transaction capacity small - the problem here is that block space costs resources and adds load to the network. We'd prefer to move as much offchain as possible but we would also like to increase on-chain capacity as much as the network can bear without sacrificing security, privacy, decentralization, etc...and there are things that need fixing so we can really do this well.\u201d \nLombrozo concludes that on-chain capacity determines how many users can join the network whereas offchain protocols allow these same users to transact without costing the network almost anything.\nSlowing down the blockchain growth\nBitcoin\u2019s blockchain currently stands at around 70GB, increasing by 5GB a month. As capacity will increase in the next few months, in the short term it may grow by 100GB a year.

Think Privacy was founded by Hanff as a response to \u2018continuing encroachment of Big Data on Privacy\u2019.\nIt came to Hanff\u2019s notice about 14 months ago that some publishers were circumventing adblocking tools in order to display ads. He decided to take upon himself to do something to remedy the situation.\nHanff has been involved in the public consultation that led to changes in the ePrivacy Directive in 2009 and has been involved in the issue for a very long time.\nHe tells Cointelegraph:\n \u201cIt is my belief (now reinforced by the EU Commission opinion) that a user installing an adblocker is facilitating the recommendations of Recital 66 of 2009/136/EC which states that a citizen may use settings of a web browser or other applications as a means to indicate whether or not they consent to web sites storing and/or accessing stored information on their devices.\u201d \nAccording to Hanff, this recital was the result of very heavy lobbying, which he witnessed first hand during the public consultation, by the adtech industry. They knew that very few people ever change their default settings.\nAs such they would be able to continue to track and profile citizens on the basis that if a user doesn\u2019t change the 3rd party cookie settings in their browser it could be implied that they were not objecting to such behaviour.\n\nAdvertisements cuts both ways\nIf we talk with specificity to the European Union, it is clear that the specific action taken by an individual to block advertisements online is a desire to not be bothered.\u00a0\nAccording to Alexander Hanff should be seen as a \u201cclear and comprehensive indication that said citizen does NOT consent to such activities.\u201d\nThe specific action we are talking about here is of course the addition of ad blocking software by individuals who want to block advertising.\nHowever there are some web publishers that are still keen on displaying advertisements for the reason of garnering revenue or otherwise. They have been lately using special software to sniff out ad-blockers.\nThis has led to quite a lot of conflict of interests between people who want to protect their privacy by installing ad blockers and content publishers who want to continue to stream advertisements.\nAs recently as March 2016, Digiday.com reports that Forbes, the popular financial magazine, and Adblock Plus exchanged heated discussions in Austin, Texas over how and which advertisements are streamed on the web.\nForbes is notably famous now for denying readers access to its content if they are found to be using adblocking software. Ironically though Adblock Plus itself is streaming what it calls acceptable advertisements now.\nThe Impact of the European Union Letter\nIn light of the letter received by Alexander Hanff, we can be certain that things are about to change with respect to how advertisements are served online.\nWe put the question to Hanff himself and asked him what impact would the letter have in EU and beyond.\nHe told us that he had written to the President of the European Commission in February 2016 asking for a formal written opinion even though he had received verbal opinion in a meeting with them a year earlier.\nHanff is of the view that a written opinion would strengthen his legal cases.\nAs for what impact this written confirmation will have, he says:", "birthday": "2016-04-28T17:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-28 16:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 28}

Ether, a crypto token used for transactions on the platform, has seen a drastic increase in value lately, making it the second largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin.\nWith more and more people making investments in Ether, many exchanges catering to bitcoin traders have started including Ethereum trading services.\nInterestingly, some of the lesser-known digital currency regions are among the first ones to add Ethereum to the list of their exchange services. After Korbit in Korea and Coincheck in Japan, BitBay is the very first exchange company to offer trading for Ethereum in Poland.\nBitBay Mission\nFounded in 2014, BitBay offers online exchange services similar to other companies. However, BitBay stands out from the crowd. Developing its services, founders strived to make them fast, and as secure and trustworthy as possible.\nBitBay puts the ensuring of the safety of transactions at the top of \u00a0their priorities. It utilizes powerful redundant dedicated servers and keeps all of its customers\u2019 funds in encrypted cold wallets. BitBay offers 2-factor authentication provided by Rublon and a number of additional security options, including Google Authenticator and email notifications.\nIn addition, BitBay aims to provide timely customer support, as time is money and BitBay does not want their users to experience any difficulties and delays in transactions. Besides offering contact via email, hotline, live chat and through their website, the company\u2019s office in Katowice welcomes its customers during weekdays.\nThis certainly contributes to trust building, especially in the current situation where security failures, scams and thefts in bitcoin businesses seem to be commonplace.\n\nDedication and ambitious plans\nBitBay is ambitious in their plans and aspirations. One of their main objectives is to become noticeable on the global market. Adjusting exchange services to the preferences of foreign users was the first step, which was successfully achieved.\nTo be successful in the global arena, a company should fit the expectations of new and potential customers.\nTherefore, BitBay is constantly expanding their offers to online payment operators, establishing partnerships and cooperations with payment services, alongside introducing new services, Ethereum trading being one of them.\nFuture of cryptocurrency in Poland\nCointelegraph had a chance to chat with Justyna Laskowska Witek from BitBay to discuss the company\u2019s latest updates to their services.\nJustyna Laskowska says:\n \u201cThis month we have introduced Ethereum trading. There are not so many Ethereum trading platforms worldwide, and BitBay is the first one of such kind in Poland. We offer our users a possibility to trade ETH against PLN, BTC, EUR, and USD\u201d. \nJustyna also shares her view on the current climate for digital currencies in Poland and prospects of its development.\nShe characterizes the overall trends as quite positive:\n \u201cBitcoin is gaining a massive interest, and you can see it from latest reports, which shows the daily trading volume of Bitcoin being over 2000 BTC and growing. Indicators for Ethereum look good as well with volume in ETH being around 500 - 1000 ETH per day.\u201d \nThe number of people who understand how cryptocurrencies work, and especially of those who actually use them, is still very limited in Poland.", "birthday": "2016-04-25T15:10:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-25 14:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 25}

The two major reasons for failure cited by\u00a0CB Insights are not establishing a real market need (42%) and \u00a0running out of cash (29%).\nEvery day, a new blockchain startup is born as more and more entrepreneurs connect the dots as to the significance of this emergent technology to affect almost every industry.\nInvestors\u2019 Angel was founded in 2015 specifically to help startups prepare themselves to raise investment including companies like Vaultoro (Bitcoin/gold trading platform), BioSSL (a biometric security company) and BraveNewCoin.\nWhat is Investors\u2019 Angel?\nInvestors\u2019 Angel has helped startups raise more than half a million dollars worth of funding and this number is growing every day.\nAccording to Addy Crezee, the CEO of Investors\u2019 Angel, the most significant problem that the company has to face is the low survivability of blockchain startups.\n \u201cI've been working in the Blockchain industry for more than 2 years and have seen a lot of brilliant startups appear on the scene with many disappearing just as quickly.

These projects have no strong competitors in the market and could attract a lot of new cryptocurrency owners.\nAngels, funds and private investors will willingly invest their money in such projects. We offer to choose more simple, profitable and less risky way.\nThe market of cryptocurrency projects is rapidly changing, and the products which were up-to-date a few years ago, are not interesting for the target audience any more.\nStrong leaders settled in the most profitable segments of the market (mining, trading, e-commerce), and nobody can move them unless they have a budget of more than one million, genius idea and a great deal of luck.\nWe all know how difficult it is to find a good idea for a startup and to configure the product which meets requirements of clients and corresponds to ideas of investors about what a profitable investment is.\nFrom the general to the special: solutions for local markets\nNon-competitive conditions and interested local investors are very attractive factors for a startup. The main thing is that you do not need to reinvent the wheel. Just take a successful global product, adapt it to a certain local market and proceed with its expansion.\nA good example of such product is the Indonesian cryptocurrency exchange market Bitcoin.co.id. The currency pair BTC/IDR (Indonesian Rupiah) is actively traded on this exchange market, and pay-in/pay-out of fiat money is available via popular local payment systems and banks.\nThe project is fairly successful which is proved by the number of users and daily turnover. Also, Bitcoin.co.id gains extra profit from currency exchange offices and ATMs which it opened in Indonesia. There one can convert cryptocurrency into cash or buy bitcoins.\nWhile the Indonesian market has already been captured (let\u2019s wish good luck and prosperity to the owners of Bitcoin.co.id) and is not attractive to those who want to launch their own exchange market, the other local markets are still available.\nFor example, in the UAE, there is only a currency exchange office opened in 2014, but no exchange market.\nAs judged by the activity of Asian and Arab investors in various startups and resources like\u00a0Angel.co, their interest in cryptocurrency projects is very high. The most active investors are from China and Singapore.\nRepresentatives of these countries are happy to invest substantial sums of money to Bitcoin projects.\nWe are talking not only about products for traders. Any global solution adapted for the local market can draw their attention.\nBringing Bitcoin into the masses: cryptocurrency promotion projects\nThe world where bitcoins are commonly used by American housewives, souvenir sellers from India and workers of German factories is a dream of all companies in Bitcoin industry.\nIn such circumstances, the Bitcoin exchange rate will increase rapidly causing the growth of Bitcoin owners\u2019 capital, and cryptocurrency projects will gain hordes of new users which will result in a substantial growth of profits.\nBig companies and funds are ready to invest millions of dollars into a product which can turn Bitcoin into a popular payment instrument. And what is left to do is to invent a good idea for popularization of cryptocurrency and bring it to life.\nThe field of activity is fairly wide. Here are some areas to think about:\n Libraries of knowledge, User Guides and Manuals, or training programs which can easily explain to a common person what Bitcoin is, what is it required for and how to use it. Technology and hardware solutions which make transactions and payments in bitcoins handy, easy and profitable for people. Popular services for remote work, marketing of goods and services paid in bitcoins, and solutions for integration of Bitcoin payments into current major products which work with micropayments (such as Uber). Cryptocurrency transfer services with favorable fees. \nThese are just a few obvious areas. But if you can find an unusual solution for popularization of cryptocurrency, you have all chances to earn millions and to cooperate with major investors.\nBlockchain scalability challenge\nDespite the potential of and prospects of blockchain, at this stage the network cannot meet the demand of global commerce.\nFor example, 47,000 transactions per second are conducted through VISA payment network, whereas Bitcoin blockchain supports only 7 transactions with a block limited to 1 MB in size.\nIt is possible to increase the number of transactions by removing a limit on the block size. But in this case, we will face another problem: if 300 bytes (on average) are used to conduct 1 transaction (without any block size limits) and the bandwidth load is equivalent to VISA\u2019s (47,000 transactions per second), the average block size will be about 8 Gb.\nSuch block must be sent in the network approximately each 10 minutes. It turns to more than 400 terabytes of data per year.\nSo, increase of the number of transactions within the network up to the scale of VISA\u2019s network will cause collapse or strong centralization of the network, since no home PC of a common user can provide network capacity and storage of such volume of data.\nThere is no doubt, that a person or a group of people who can solve the problem of scalability will receive support from investors. In fact, this task is directly related to popularization of Bitcoin and its use as a global payment instrument.\nNow the world\u2019s best minds are trying to solve this challenge. Not so long ago American developers offered the Lightning technology, but Lightning Bitcoin Network is still in the process of implementation and, as per rumors, the developers have faced a number of serious problems.\nSolution to the problems of mining\nThe difficulty of the network grows, Chinese manufacturers of chips get bigger and better and mining payoffs decrease.\nTop-managers of the companies engaged in Bitcoin mining and production of miners lose their sleep while dreaming of a talented engineer who will come and bring them a new chip prototype which would substantially outperform all existing products.\nProjects and solutions aimed at reducing maintenance costs (miners\u2019 power consumption, maintenance and replacement of equipment) also attract a great interest.\nIf you are a guru of hardware startups capable to solve the above challenges, there will be no end of people wanting to buy your solution. And then you will only need to choose an investor and a villa in California.\nTools for traders", "birthday": "2016-04-26T10:20:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-26 09:20:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 26}

Cointelegraph talked to blockchain modernizers about the application of a \u201cfrictionless\u201d loyalty ecosystem.\nThe key payment and fraud-related topics will also be discussed at the 10th annual\u00a0Airline & Travel Payments Summit (ATPS), co-hosted with UATP. This event will take place in Barcelona on April 26-27 and will offer three conference tracks:\n Payments Track, Fraud Track, Travel Agency & OTA Track. \nMain sectors of Blockchain application in the tourism industry\nGregory Simon, CEO and co-founder at\u00a0Ribbit.me, identifies four main sectors that Blockchain could be applied in: money, passports, reservations and insurance.\nMoney: Blockchain travel application is about money. Bitcoin payment from a smartphone to a foreign currency exchange is an expensive procedure. If it is not possible to pay with Bitcoin, another cryptocurrency application is more beneficial through worldwide Bitcoin ATMs or converting fiat money from Bitcoin to local currency through a crypto exchange. Another crypto application is Loyalty Network at Ribbit.\nPassports: On the blockchain we could be storing important documents such as passports, visas, permits, identification cards, and driving licenses.\nReservations: Travel DAC (distributed autonomous corporation) like Ethereum blockchain shows the way. By this, a traveler could be more efficiently organized.\nInsurance: Travel insurance through decentralized peer-to-peer are viable alternatives, as it is cheaper and offers more transparency.\n\nBitcoin is a borderless technology\nChristopher Franko, Blockchain scientist at Ribbit.me, notes that bitcoin is a borderless technology. That\u2019s what makes it so powerful for the travel industry. \u00a0\nFranko explains to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cI can have one dollar or one million dollars in my pocket and travel to any other country in the world with very little risk of it being extorted from me. Try that with a suitcase of $100 bills and you will probably be the proud owner of an empty suitcase pretty swiftly. Whether Expedia takes it or not is irrelevant, it's whether you can take it with you and trade it for goods and services or not.\u201d \nWhether we need a special blockchain back up by a new cryptocurrency, Franko says that he doesn\u2019t see why it would be needed.\nHe tells Cointelegraph:\n \u201cIf they feel they can do it better than any other blockchain that exists then go for it! I mean, a blockchain is essentially a decentralized, fault tolerant, incorruptible, transparent database and if you feel those qualities are what you need for your project, then by all means, make one.\u201d \nOnline travel agency\nKalpesh Patel, Owner of\u00a0Green Country Inn and\u00a0BookwithBit.com, explains that there is a need for an online travel agency. His website, bookwithbit.com, only accepts Bitcoin while Expedia does offer it as a payment method, with limited success.\nPatel explains to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cThe experience people have had from Expedia by booking with Bitcoin has been very negative. Also there are no booking promotions for using Bitconi. For example, while many sites offer special rates or other benefits, Expedia offers nothing. There are also no offers to hotels or their guests so why would they use Bitcoin to book a hotel when they know Bitcoin will be worth more in future?\u201d \nThere are a lot of problems that the Bitcoin community should solve. Patel underlines that it has to create fast working services for Bitcoin. For example, if a hotel receives Bitcoin, it should be able to buy something or pay bills with Bitcoin. \u00a0\nPatel continues that when someone pays using Bitcoin, a merchant converts Bitcoins into dollars. As the value of Bitcoin goes up and down, it is necessary to create an economy solely for Bitcoin. It therefore needs funding from VC or support from the Bitcoin community to do so.\n\nNo real benefit for a traveler yet\nLee Gibson Grant, Developer of Drachmae Travel Club at bitcointalk.org, explains that it is necessary to take into consideration why Bitcoin or the Blockchain has not disrupted the travel sector even with that particular sector being very slow to innovate.\nGrant believes that travellers and businesses alike need to see more benefits other than transparency and cheaper methods of payment.\nHe says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cCurrently, there is no real benefit for a traveler to go and buy bitcoin. Also many people in the cryptosphere have an illusion that Bitcoin is widespread and readily available. If the traveler does not have access to the Internet or online banking and there is no Bitcoin ATM in the location, they are left with the predicament of Bitcoin holding its value but with no means of exchanging it into an local acceptable currency.\u201d \nAccording to Grant, currently Bitcoin doesn't offer enough incentives to be adopted or to have market demand. Bitcoin therefore fails to service the 4 horizontals required by the travelers and travel sector.", "birthday": "2016-04-25T16:35:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-25 15:35:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 25}

However, rather than having many corresponding nodes and miners verifying transactions, it is centralized. Access to a Swift server, therefore, allows for manipulation of the data and potentially theft in a grand scale.\nIn this case, analysis of code repository uploaded from Bangladesh showed that the malware allowed the hackers to delete records and intercept incoming messages.\nMoreover, they were able to intercept confirming messages sent for printing as a security measure.

This revolutionary technology will reduce if not completely remove some of the boundaries that currently exist within a purchase process that occurs between national borders.\u201d \nMarco Montes Neri, founder of mobile payments platform Saldo.mx, has seen Bitcoin and blockchain technology surpass borders to a great degree, calling it a \u201cregulatory agnostic.\u201d\nNeri explains to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cWithin the store of value aspect of Bitcoin it is the first universal \u201cnostro account\u201d (for those who are familiar with correspondent banking) which creates an opportunity to connect payment networks. In reality is hard to integrate with those networks due to the state of the legacy systems, but it is matter of time (as payment networks evolve) that cross border settlement will occur there, either for securities or other forms of value. It just works.\u201d \nA tale of a truly global economy\nMartin Jansen, a member of the Auroracoin development team, recounted a story of employing a programmer in India using Bitcoin.\nJansen tells Cointelegraph:\n \u201cThen we became more acquainted and it seemed he was extremely good at programing websites and learning new stuff. So I asked him, can you port this Hive stuff? He said he would look into it and after two days he already had a working beta version that actually looked more like an end product to me! I was so amazed with his skills and devotion, I decided to ask for his BTC address so I could send him some appreciation. After transferring 0.5 BTC he immediately responded asking if I lost my mind. It seems I just transferred the equivalent of his monthly salary (and he has a good job as a programmer).\u201d Thanks to blockchain technology, this business partnership resulted in, as Jansen puts it, \u201ca Stargate-like bridge between our two monetary dimensions, and we seem to profit from it both!\u201d \nJansen continues:\n \u201cThis immediately made me realize we had found an absolute win-win situation based on blockchain tech. We found a timeless bridge between two different dimensions of wealth. Here I was, paying at least \u20ac 1300 a month for my mortgage and another \u20ac 1100 for my car while he was living in a neat house for \u20ac 75 and drove a nice car for \u20ac 90. The product he delivered though, would cost me at least 20x the price if I would order it in my dimension. Still, he was the luckiest guy around, because he found an idiot on another dimension paying a month salary, for only two days work.\u201d \nThe end of borders?\nFor Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, founder of Bitnation, Bitcoin\u2019s borderless aspects represent something much greater than simply easier international transactions.", "birthday": "2016-04-26T16:07:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-26 15:07:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 26}

However, as most moved from mining Bitcoin to buying, systemic entry points, or exchanges, sprang up.\nAs a ledger history was created, known addresses, often those belonging to Bitcoin exchanges, became, in effect, de-anonymising tools.\nFinancial regulation of Bitcoin exchanges\nWhen Bitcoin became more prominent and popular,\u00a0regulators\u00a0took enforcement action.\nThe community\u2019s pushback secured no regulation of the protocol itself, but Bitcoin exchanges were forced to comply with numerous financial regulations.\nAlthough Bitcoin addresses are made of random letters and numbers, each address is unique. Once ownership of the address is revealed, everyone can see all the transactions it performed.\nIf, therefore, that address received or deposited to a known illegal or even undesirable (as regulators deem it) service provider, exchanges may freeze the account or deny service as well as perhaps or rather likely share data with third parties.\nIf all exchanges or service providers share their data with a central entity, then it may be possible to track most transactions with reasonable confidence as the centralized points (exchanges or service providers) shed light on what likely occurred when the transaction is onchain.\nRetaining privacy\nOne method to retain privacy is to use a new address every time a new transaction is made.\nHowever, one could easily assume such action was performed, especially if subsequent transactions re-inforce the assumption in one way or another.\nThere are mixing services, like coinjoin, which pools different amounts, mixes them all together and sends them off to different addresses, as well as other methods.\nHowever, would non-technical users be able or willing to spend time and effort into employing such methods?\nShould they, therefore, be incorporated in the protocol itself and if they are, how would regulators, which are currently engaged in an intense fight with Apple in the so-called crypto wars 2.0, react?\nMany companies, including Apple, are now employing end to end encryption and other cryptographic methods which provide full privacy for the masses.\nSending transactions off-chain\nFor Bitcoin, the answer is slightly more complex.

Being introduced in seemingly the right place and in the right time, it was the second largest cryptocurrency before it even launched, valued at half a billion dollars.\nIceland\u2019s major default\nFor decades, Iceland has had a stable and rich economy that was built on fishing, tourism, and aluminium smelting.\nOver time, however, it turned into an Arctic backwater specializing in global finance.\nThen was the year 2008 when Iceland experienced one of the most harsh economic and political events.\nAll three of the country\u2019s major privately owned commercial banks, Landsbanki, Kaupthing and Glitnir, collapsed, having amassed assets worth 10 times more than Iceland\u2019s annual economic output. Offering interest rates higher than anywhere else, they steadily grew their accumulations.\nLoaded with the cash, Iceland\u2019s bankers went on a purchasing binge, buying foreign companies, foreign real estate, even foreign soccer teams. However, they were paying high prices for questionable assets.\nCapital controls\nIceland\u2019s government could not afford to bail out its banks that had gotten so much bigger than the country\u2019s economy. Therefore, the only choice was to let them go under.\nThat would mean that only foreigners lost their money, but would guarantee its own people\u2019s deposits.\nIn November 2008, Iceland imposed measures to fix the broken financial system.\nThe introduced capital controls slowed capital flight; investors that invested fortunes in Icelandic assets were prevented from selling them, converting the earnings into foreign currency and transferring them out of the country.\nIn addition, the controls prevented krona-denominated assets from being brought back to Iceland and sold for krona, which then might have been readily exchanged for other currencies.\nThese limits kept the krona from devaluing as much as it otherwise would have done.\nAn attempt to fix a broken economy\nSince the collapse of 2008, everyone has been looking for ways to exit the Icelandic krona.\nHlynur \u00de\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rnsson, board member of the Aurar\u00e1\u00f0 foundation, says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cAuroracoin came into the picture in 2014 with a fresh idea. Replace the Icelandic krona with a cryptocurrency.\u201d \nAuroracoin was designed to break the shackles of the fiat currency financial system in the country.\nCryptocurrency was seen as an opportunity for Icelanders to free themselves from currency controls and government debasement of the currency.\nShine of Auroracoin\nAuroracoin is an experimental cryptocurrency based on the Litecoin protocol. The general objective of Auroracoin was to provide the people of Iceland with a digital option over the country\u2019s fiat denomination.\nThe distribution of Auroracoins started with an airdrop of premined Auroracoins to the Icelandic nation in March 2014.\nIt was meant to be a one-time event to create the conditions for Icelanders to start using the currency through providing them with start capital and making them aware of the currency and its possibilities. 50% of the total number of Auroracoins were sent to the country\u2019s citizens.\nEntering their permanent resident ID on Auroracoin\u2019s official website, every citizen would get 31,8 AUR just for being Icelandic. After the airdrop, the only way to acquire Auroracoins would be through mining and transacting. \u00a0\nAuroracoin is often considered not to be just another novelty currency, but more as a political statement. Even before the airdrop, Auroracoin quickly rose to prominence amongst the myriads of new digital currencies mainly because of its unique approach to community building.\nThe idea of digital currency being a liberating force quickly spread, and Auroracoin has spawned a wave of imitators, including scotcoin and spaincoin.\n\nSignificant flaws\nAuroracoin was an intriguing phenomenon to many, mostly in terms of the possibilities to begin a new precedent for digital currency dispersion and marketing. There had been many theories on how Auroracoin would perform.\nAuroracoin\u2019s creator was smart about the timing: people who are exhausted by one system are far more willing and open for an experiment. Unfortunately, that assumption was too ambitious.\nGiven that the general public in Iceland is not that aware of Auroracoin, much less digital currencies, some were quite skeptical.\nWithin a month of the launch, less than 10% of Icelanders had picked up their free money, and the price fell and flatlined. It is now worth $0.330647, down from over $30 at its highest.\nAuroracoin\u2019s brief rise was intense and ephemeral, just like the northern lights it was named after. Many claim that it will remain a likely unrepeatable phenomenon.\nAuroracoin Airdrop\nA number of factors have contributed to Auroracoin\u2019s whiffing away. First of all, even though the airdropping ensured a built-in group of users, it did not give them any place to spend the money, as it did not have any strong retail support.\nBesides, many users experienced technical issues. Thus, Icelanders living abroad had problems claiming their shares.\nDue to heavy traffic, the Auroracoin website crashed many times, significantly slowing down confirmation times for receiving coins, which made trading almost impossible. If Auroracoin users had a place to spend Auroracoins, those spending confirmations would have been slow too.", "birthday": "2016-04-19T14:55:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-19 13:55:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 19}

In an email that we have which originated from her official account at the domain trusteuaffairs.com on January 27, 2016, she lays the groundwork for a second meeting on February 10, 2016 at Science 14 Atrium, rue de la Science 14b in Brussels.\nThe recipients of this mail include people like Marcel Roelants of bitpay.com, Laurent Kratz of neofacto.com and Michael Gronager of chainanlysis.com and several others.\nThe meeting was supposedly to be held between her clients that include the recipients and a delegation from the European Parliament, which included the shadow rapporteurs.\nShe claims in her email that a detailed agenda was to be circulated a week before the meeting on February 10 and asks the recipients about who all would be participating.\nThe mail has a MS Word document as an attachment, which contains inputs, which were sent to the European Parliament by her and were constructed on the advice of her \u2018working group\u2019.\nMs.\u00a0Monaco is pushing the idea that somehow getting virtual currencies in a regulatory framework would legitimise their operation and allow players to be accepted by their peers in the financial services industry.\nHer inputs to the European Parliament are quite specific and we quote:\n \u201cAML/Consumer Protection laws should be applied to the activities/functions being played out in this industry may prove more beneficial to the virtual currencies industry.\u00a0This would incentivise early ecosystem participants to build out such controls and practices, as most of the industry players are already doing and continue to strengthen.\u201d \nThe Terrorist Bogeyman and Coffee with Brussels\nThe terror attacks in Paris and Brussels could not have come at a better time for these champions of Bitcoin regulations.\nIn a later email dated February 1, Ms. Monaco indulges in a bit of namedropping and goes on to say to her \u2018workgroup\u2019, \u201cOn a different note, I just had coffee with\u00a0a contact from the European Commission DG FISMA. I understand they are going to publish this week \u2013very likely tomorrow, the 2nd of February- an Action Plan on anti terrorism, following the Council announcement in December after the 13th of November terrorists attacks in Paris\u201d.\nThis email also has an attachment that includes her summary of the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affair\u2019s Public Hearing on Virtual Currencies that was held on January 25, 2016 between 1500-1630 hrs. This hearing was held for preparing an upcoming own-initiative (INI) report from the European Parliament (Rapporteur: Jakob von Weizsaecker, S&D/DE). The panellists included representatives from the European Commission (DG FISMA) and the ECB as well as academia and stakeholders from the private sector.\nUS style Bitcoin control for Europe\nIn submissions to Mr Jakob von Weizsaecker MEP (S&D, Germany), Rapporteur for the European Parliament - INI Report on digital currencies, Ms. Monaco explains in great detail about how the US deals with suspicions financial dealings and how they are reported to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), an agency of the Department of Treasury.\nHere is an excerpt in her own words, \u201cAll money services business (MSB) - businesses that transmit or convert money, hence both banks and non-banks financial institutions - need to monitor and report suspicious activity.\u201d \u00a0\nWhat is alarming though is that Ms. Monica and her friends instead of being constructive and creating an European solution for Europe want to impose a US system on a whole continent full of different countries and cultures. She advises the MEP under the header Desirable outcome of the Report, \u201cSome minimum reporting compliance elements \u2013such for example the system in place in the USA \u2013 could prove helpful.\u201d", "birthday": "2016-04-20T14:30:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-20 13:30:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 20}

However, considering his high position and the usual lack of publicity from the Russian officials of his ranking, the article may potentially be a signal of the government taking a more defined stance.\nSome people have claimed that this may be an attempt at testing ground before going ahead with the actual legislation, which would mean that things are looking grim for Bitcoin in Russia.\nOther suggestions of Bastrykin\nBesides proposing the ban on cryptocurrencies, Bastrykin has suggested other measures in his article, that some may see as radical: introducing a uniform state-level ideology, applying Internet control practices similar to those of China, blocking websites without due court process and many others.\nBastrykin\u2019s article opened with him mentioning the recent increase in statistics of crimes of terrorist and extremist nature.

", "content": "Today\u2019s infrastructure cannot accommodate on a global level for the technology of tomorrow, says our expert Brandon Kostinuk of Vanbex. However, progressive policies supported by global economic players can rapidly change that.\nLisa Cheng, Vanbex Group CEO, who has years of experience dealing with Bitcoin and blockchain technology, says:\n \u201cTo begin usurping traditional models of banking and finance we have to move society beyond our current understanding of currency and see that it exists today as digital value. Paper currency is on its way out and will be replaced entirely by digital forms.\u201d \nAccording Brandon Kostinuk, we are already in a globalized economy with digital assets floating everywhere. Even traditional banks, as it\u2019s well known, store money electronically as financial information in databases.\nFrom fintech to the Internet-based economy\nCountries like Barbados, Peru and Ecuador have already leaped passed conjecture, concurrently offering a digital variation alongside their physical currency. Citizens there use digital currency for everyday items like groceries and fuel for their car, facilitated by smartphone technology.\nGovernments worldwide from the U.K. to China, Australia to Canada, are all looking at ways to develop, adopt and adapt to disruptive financial technology (fintech) to progressively move with the shifting sands pressed on society by the Internet-based economy.\nAt its most reductive core, intangible assets need a physical carrier and that\u2019s where the discussion of hardware wallets \u2014 devices that store a part of a user's wallet for digital currency securely in mostly-offline hardware \u2014 enters the fray.\nBen Broadbent, Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy at the Bank of England, says:\n \u201cCurrently, deposits are backed mainly by illiquid loans, assets that can\u2019t be sold on open markets; if we all tried simultaneously to close our accounts, banks wouldn\u2019t have the liquid resources to meet the demand.\u201d \n\nA Digital Economy\nJust a decade ago, it\u2019s safe to say most of mankind didn\u2019t even know a thing like cryptocurrency existed, which, even before Bitcoin, it did.\nThere was E-gold, which launched in 1996 and, as the name suggests, was a digital currency backed by gold. Ten years later, Liberty Reserve, a Costa Rica-based centralized digital currency, was founded as an exchange.\nHowever, both enterprises went down the path of criminal activity, specifically money laundering.\nThe digital currency - a cryptocurrency - created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 reshaped the conversation. It changed the way money, the way a currency, was thought of and its underlying Blockchain technology, a decentralized virtual clearinghouse and asset registry, as described by Broadbent last month, is gearing up to change the very financial structure of the globalized economy.\nBitcoin represents, in market cap today, over USD $6 billion. It has spawned an industry, from exchanges and financial services to infrastructure, gambling, news media and more. Much more.\nThe nucleus of any currency is trust\nThe now infamous Mt. Gox \u201chack,\u201d an episode that came to light in April 2014, showed the world security against malicious intent was of paramount concern when it came to digital currency (and that could be said of any form of money).\nLaunched in 2010, the Tokyo-based exchange, the largest at the time, eventually handled around 70 percent of all Bitcoin transactions at the height of operations in 2013.\nThe total amount said to have been stolen hovered around $450 million (around 850,000 bitcoins).\nAccording to WizSec lead investigator, Kim Nilsson, \"most or all of the missing bitcoins were stolen straight out of the MtGox hot wallet over time, beginning in late 2011.\"\nThe need for secure, offline storage was apparent then and that need is no less great today.\nBlockchain security\n\u201cBlockchain security has advanced much quicker than you would see in traditional banking,\u201d Darin Stanchfield told CNBC\u2019s On the Money.\nThe KeepKey CEO was commenting on the Bangladesh bank hack that occurred at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York where $100 million was reportedly stolen from the government\u2019s account.\nStanchfield explained, with a device like the hardware wallet (or a vault), credentials are presented to the Federal Reserve in order to move money. These credentials would be presented when the device is first initialized and those credentials don\u2019t ever leave the device.\nThis is in contrast to any \u2018hot wallet\u2019 and is the most effective standard to safeguard against hackers in the cryptographic age of computer security. Something offline can\u2019t be invaded by external elements.\nMost vibrant fintech hubs\nBut nations and their laws and regulations move at different speeds, especially when it comes to adoption of emerging technology.\nOne of the most vibrant fintech hubs in the world exists in the U.K. with London\u2019s ecosystem of startups and companies generating \u00a36.6 billion ($9.4 billion) in revenue and attracted \u00a3524 million (over $700 million) in investment in 2015, according to accounting firm Ernst & Young.\nThe study occurred because it was commissioned by the U.K. government. The British government is a leading example of progressive policy-making within the fintech sector and is the primary reason it is home to the fast-growing sector in the country.\nErnst & Young further reported that the sector employs 61,000 people (5% of the total financial services workforce). More people are working in the U.K. fintech scene than in New York, or in the combined FinTech workforce of Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia.\nGovernmental regulations\nIn March 2015, HM Treasury \u2014 the government arm responsible for developing and executing public finance policy and economic policy in Britain \u2014 also published a report, stating, in response to the emerging fintech sector \u201cthe government intends to apply anti-money laundering regulation to digital currency exchanges, to support innovation and prevent criminal use.\u201d\nFurther, the government has been discussing the possibility and implications of issuing central bank digital currency (CBDC).\nDeputy Governor Broadbent states:\n \u201cIt seems very unlikely that, to any significant extent, we\u2019ll ever be paying for things in bitcoins, rather than pounds, dollars or euros. The more important issue for central banks considering such a move [to issue digital currency] will be what it might mean for the funding of banks and the supply of credit.\u201d \nThe government in the UK, at least those in control of the nation\u2019s monetary policy, is already thinking about implications, structural and otherwise, of appropriating digital currency.\nThe conversation has leaped from opposition into adoption and it very much has to do with the underlying backbone of Nakamoto\u2019s creation, touted as the next evolutionary step to the Internet.\nUbiquitous as Smartphones\nPart and parcel of the talked of and trialed evolution of the financial layer of industrialized societies is blockchain technology. This is where transactions are created, recorded and preserved in a secure, decentralized structure.\nThe Internet economy has sprung the need to advance financial interactions the same way it has developed new ways of considering technology and conducting business altogether.\nThe most practical concern, that of safely securing and using digital currency, is a phenomenon which is itself being worked and re-worked in regard to the implications outlined by Broadbent and others, like Financial Stability Board chairman and Bank of England governor, Mark Carney.\nBut amid the pursuit, by Microsoft and IBM, to bring blockchain tools and enterprise access to \u00a0the market, along with the corporate race to build the blockchain of all blockchains for the financial services and banking industry, among other interested parties, it\u2019s clear: digital currency is here and hardware wallets will be as ubiquitous to everyday life as smartphones.\nAnd as digital currency becomes commonplace, granted the technological and regulatory environment catches up, hardware wallets will be a vital instrument, used daily by individuals.\nOffline bank account for digital currency\nDoug Miller, head of business development at KeepKey, the Washington-based maker of one of the few premium hardware wallets on the market today, explained, security and user-friendliness were core factors in their device\u2019s design.\nMiller says:\n \u201cIt has to be simple and it can\u2019t be complicated. What we wanted to do was streamline the process for use in an everyday aspect.\" \nWith KeepKey, a typical transaction doesn\u2019t involve the computer client storing private keys and signing transactions. The computer client will pass transactions to KeepKey, request they be signed and the user signs for it on their end, following the on-screen demands legible on the a 3.12\u201d OLED.\nIt is, ostensibly, a private, offline bank account for digital currency.\n\nSetup and installation is conducted online, using Chrome extensions, and can be completed within a matter of seconds.\nSearching for the right wallet\nJordan Tuwiner, 21, who founded the site BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com, a resource for topics related to Bitcoin, has been involved in using digital currency and hardware wallets for the past two years.", "birthday": "2016-04-21T14:30:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-21 13:30:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 21}

It is easy to lose sight of the core, perhaps altruistic, driving force of creating technology, which is advancement.\nMobile money accounts can drive financial inclusion in Africa\nBrandon Kostinuk makes reference to President and CEO of the San Francisco Federal Reserve John C. Williams\u2019 comment during a presentation he gave to the Lendit USA 2016 conference.\nWilliams says:\n \u201cGlobally, we\u2019re seeing the emergence of payment systems via mobile phones in places where the vast majority of people are unbanked or underbanked, but have cell phones. Instead of paying huge fees for bank-like services, it\u2019s all done through text or the touch of a few buttons. This has made its mark in some areas, is starting to gain a foothold in others, and even has potential here.\u201d \n\nThe World Bank\u2019s Global Findex, a comprehensive database on financial inclusion, launched in 2014, listed around 2.5 billion adults as being unbanked consumers, that is, those without access to even basic financial services.\nTwo-thirds of adults cited in a 2014 World Bank study listed lack of money as the single biggest obstacle. The other third cited the cost of opening and maintaining an account or access to a bank (too far to be accessible) as other reasons for not owning a conventional account.\nBut digital currency and related fintech innovations, from automated teller services to the smartphone technology that facilitates payment and reception of money, are helping buck traditional impediments to accessing financial services and the horizon is already widening more than imagination ever thought 15, 20 years ago.\nThe Sub-Saharan African region, according to a report released by the European Investment Bank (EIB) last July, \u201cleads the world in mobile money accounts: while just 2 percent of adults worldwide have a mobile money account, 12 percent [64 million adults] in SSA have one.\u201d\nOf that 64 million, 45 percent listed their mobile money account as the only account they possessed.\nThe evidence in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), as stated by the World Bank, is that \u201cmobile money accounts can drive financial inclusion,\u201d even in a region where the financial systems are underdeveloped, where the banking sectors are typically concentrated and are generally inefficient at financial intermediation, according to the EIB.\nThey are constrained by their small size. Competition is still limited.\nThe banks are becoming neglected\nMbwana Alliy, managing partner at African technology venture firm the Savannah Fund, says:\n \u201cYou have a headwind from Silicon Valley and Europe blowing into Africa now around the disruption in fintech. The banks are really nervous and they want to get ahead of this.\u201d \nA fintech hub and accelerator program were recently established in Cape Town with the latter just launching in March with a cast of 10 startups.\nThe fintech fervor in the SSA region is built on an expectation of capitalizing on the market-ready conditions. On the other hand, fintech innovation has a place in the SSA region because it\u2019s helping advance the societies there.\nThe movement of digital assets (physical currency represented in digital information), or, in the case of Kenya, South Africa and elsewhere, digital currency (the M-pesa), allows users to deposit, withdraw and transfer money to pay for goods and services with ease using a mobile device.\nThese transaction accounts, as explained by Gloria M. Grandolini, a senior director at World Bank Group and chair of the Global Remittances Working Group, open up access, \u201cproviding a basic entry point, or pathway, to broader financial inclusion.\u201d\nCitizens of lower economic level are able to save and secure money. They can accept and direct government benefits and, in rural areas, can connect and access financial services all facilitated by smartphone technology and related applications.\nThere is deliberate and systematic education and awareness\nFrom Nigeria to Mozambique positive benefits to broader financial access is a reality because barriers to access have been eased by financial technological progression.\nIn the West African republic, Nigerian students were encouraged and motivated to open their own (transaction) accounts where they were taught how to use an online account properly to save money, safely and securely, pay bills and more.\nIn Mozambique, mobile-money has been used to increase remittances in rural areas, taking the position of informal practices that once dominated the nation\u2019s countryside.\nThese are stepping stones toward achieving even broader financial goals, as according to the World Bank, which is leading the initiative.\nMobile devices are gateways, they facilitate access, expandable beyond currency alone, to insurance, clean water and solar energy.\nCoverage, regulatory and market structures remain a challenge\nBut there are particular difficulties in offering digital services. In August 2014, in a report titled Opportunities of Digitizing Payments, the World Bank stated:\nProviding physical access to financial services or cash-in/out points and ensuring sufficient liquidity at access points, including in rural areas, remain the core challenges in moving toward digital payments.\nThe World Bank Group, parent organization of the World Bank, slated 2020 as the target year to achieve Universal Financial Access (UFA), an initiative that calls for adults everywhere to have access to a transaction account to store money, send and receive payments.\nAnd despite current progress, oversight, accessibility and proper development also remain pivotal obstacles.", "birthday": "2016-04-22T09:45:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-22 08:45:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 22}

And I'd say that approach continues to drive what we're doing in the crypto space with t0.com today: we're doing this as both a good entrepreneurial business decision and because we're moving civilization forward a few steps.\n\nBleeding edge of progress\nCT: How far has Byrne's passion for crypto sifted down through the corporate culture? Is it a shared interest across the whole company, or more \"the boss's thing\"?\nJB: In our company, as with society as a whole, the number of people who really get the blockchain is pretty small. Most of those at Overstock.com who do get it, and express an interest in getting involved, seem to gravitate toward t0 and are now part of that corner of the organization.\nSo crypto itself hasn't really permeated the company much. But what it has done is underscore the reputation we want to foster of Overstock.com as a center of really interesting technological development. In this sense it's been great.\nThere's a thriving tech culture here in Salt Lake City, Utah, and plenty of competition for talent. Having the reputation of being on the bleeding edge of progress in this particular space has bolstered our reputation as an interesting place to work generally.\nCT: So it's not something that most people have to deal with at all?", "birthday": "2016-04-21T17:29:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-21 16:29:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 21}

National Security: Debate Over Encryption Ban Takes a New Turn in the US ", "content": "Active discussions over Encryption ban take a new turn as the US Intelligence Committee Leaders released Discussion draft of Encryption bill. Bitcoin community members ring alarm bells.\nDecryption of data to fight terrorism\nEncryption is not a new nor a radical discussion topic. It has been hitting the headlines even more for the last couple of months.\nGovernment officials around the world are proposing bills to have encryption weakened with the only intention to protect citizens from criminals and terrorists.\nA little while ago, the US state lawmakers proposed a new bill to weaken smartphone encryption by default, to avoid its use cases for terrorism. Then, California Assemblymember Jim Cooper proposed a very similar bill with a slightly different reason behind it. Rather than justifying it with the need to fight terrorism, he proposed to bring an end to human trafficking on a global scale.\nNo matter what reasons government officials are using to justify their suggestions, the bills are always looking to achieve the same goal: weaken data encryption on a large scale to decrypt and unlock stored information by the manufacturer or operating system provider.\nA New Encryption Draft Bill\nWhile many keep questioning how accessing users\u2019 encrypted data can help governments fight terrorism, let's turn to this month\u2019s backlash caused by the release of Encryption Draft Bill by the US Intelligence Committee.\nThe bill states that everyone must comply with the law to protect America from criminals and terrorists. A great intention, but at what cost? The bill establishes that Providers of communication services and products should protect US people\u2019s privacy introducing strong data protection measures while still complying with court orders and other legal requirements. Simply put, all device manufacturers, software manufacturers, electronic communications services, remote communication services, or any provider of a product or a method to facilitate communication or to process or store data must provide information or data to the government if received a court order. The Draft bill states that no one is above the law and everyone must comply with court orders to ensure protection from criminals and terrorists. Doesn\u2019t sound like anything new, but the draft bill still raises some concerns.\nSimply put, there is a limit to our privacy and all data can be handed to authorities by their request.\nThe bill establishes that providers of services or products that facilitate communication or storing and processing data should protect US persons\u2019 privacy with strong data security while still complying with court orders and other legal requirements. Is it even possible to achieve both?\nDivided opinions\nGovernment authorities behind the draft bill justify it with the fact that this is one of the ways to protect the lives and wellbeing of the US citizens.\nCommittee on Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr says:\n \u201cI have long believed that data is too insecure, and feel strongly that consumers have a right to seek solutions that protect their information \u2013 which involves strong encryption. I do not believe, however, that those solutions should be above the law.\u201d \nBurr hopes that this draft will start a meaningful and inclusive debate on the role of encryption and its place within the rule of law. \u00a0\nBoth users and manufacturers have always been strongly pro-encryption, with the latter expressing their intentions to even build additional layers to protect the data. In their view, proposed legislation to weaken encryption will only cause immense harm.\nKevin Bankston, Director of the Open Technology Institute at New America, a Washington think tank says:\n \"It is hard to overstate how disastrous for the security of all of our data as well as the economic security of our tech sector this would be.\" \nFrom his perspective, lawmakers working on this kind of legislation just do not understand the implications of forcing companies to provide digital back doors to technology that is supposed to be secure.\nBankston continues:\n \"It's not possible to build some special access capability for the government into our most secure data without also making it vulnerable to other bad actors. And yet this bill says, 'We don't care. Do magic, find a way to secure all of our data while also making it available on demand to the government at any time.' And that's simply not possible.\" \n\nOther security experts are unanimously criticizing the Encryption bill draft.\nSecurity researcher Jonathan Zdziarski says the entire bill is dangerous - it will weaken the security of America's technology infrastructure. This will affect everything from the iPhone you hold in your pocket to how data is transmitted over the Internet, allowing the government to effectively break all electronic commerce and Internet security.\nZdziarski notes:\n \u201cThis is bad legislation in every way, and it very subtly allows for unconstitutional government control of private industry.\u201d \nWhat about digital currency sector?\nThe attempt of government officials who are not approving of any social network and internet service that is 100% secret to make them abandon their claimed privacy policies will certainly have an impact on the cryptocurrency sector.\nWould this kind of legislation make it impossible for bitcoin businesses to function further if such secrecy were banned? Or would that give a new direction for them to develop further?\nReddit Community members are resenting:\n \u201cHow do they plan on stopping terrorists from using PGP and other open source encryption tools? If passed, this law will limit our privacy and be as successful as the war on drugs.\u201d \u201cIn fact, the only people I've met who actually SUPPORT this bullshit are conservatives who are too old to understand how the internet works.\u201d \u201cYou can't have both. The real security you can offer customers and clients is the same security that the government wants you to weaken or even disable strictly for them. They want it both ways.\u201d \nThreats to our privacy\nThe threats to our data are numerous, it might be targeted by rogue hackers for many reasons ranging from nefarious to advantageous or just absurd. When it comes to money, we all certainly want our savings to be stored and transferred safely and securely.\nAny regulatory burden, especially of this kind, would certainly influence businesses that are running digital currency services. Governments taking further steps on limiting encryption would shift their businesses overseas with more encryption-friendly policies.", "birthday": "2016-04-22T11:15:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-22 10:15:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 22}

Besides making it faster and easier, Bitcoin could help India save up to $7 billion in fees paid to international remittance companies and add this amount to the country's wealth.\nAccording to India\u2019s Economic Times, foreigners living in Gulf countries, most of which are Indians, sent about US$100 billion in remittances. A lot of these Gulf-based Indians are working as blue collar workers and have families that are dependant on them back home.\nHowever, there is not only money being sent back to India. In fact, a lot of money is also flowing out. Ibtimes.co.in reports that in FY 16, Indians sent US$4 billion alone to students studying outside the country.\nTraditionally, all this money is sent by parents who are supporting the higher education of their children. Most Indian people tend to either use wire transfer services like Western Union or Moneygram or banking channels like SWIFT.\nWestern Union in India has a partnership with India Post, the Indian post office that allows them access to nearly 10,000 post offices throughout India. The Western Union network is well recognized in India and they have over 110,000 agents in the country.\nThe Indian remittance scene\nWe wanted to better understand how the Indian remittance market is structured so we talked with some players who operate in India.\nZebPay Co-founder and COO, Sandeep Goenka says, \u201cIndia is the world's biggest remittance market at more than $70 billion.\u201d\nHe points out that the majority of the remittance is small amounts of around $200. For small amounts especially, users end up paying up to 15% in fees to companies like PayPal, Western Union or to banks through transfer and exchange rate fees. Bitcoin makes it extremely easy to send a small remittance back home.\nBesides making it faster and easier, it could help save India up to $7 billion in fees paid to international remittance companies and add this amount to \u00a0country's wealth.\nZebPay\u2019s focus is on creating bitcoin infrastructure and a reliable bitcoin exchange in India and they have a partnership with BitWage. They also offer services which allow their users to buy Amazon India and Flipkart shopping coupons. ZebPay also offers a mobile phone top up service for prepaid cellular phones in India.\nKamesh Mupparaju, CEO of BTCXIndia, agrees about the size of remittances to India and the potential that bitcoin has in this area:\n \u201cBitcoin has a huge potential to make remittances cheaper, and for India especially. The absolute majority of remittances to India are sums under $500, and for transfers of this size fees quickly become a very high percentage of the total sums sent.\u201d \nKamesh thinks that \u00a0Bitcoin offers a very cheap and effective solution for small remittances and can cut total fees of 1-2% for transfers of say $50 and in many instances other remittances services charge as high as above 10%.\nBanking the unbanked\nIndia is a nation of 1 billion people and a lot of them do not have access to basics that are taken for granted by many people in other countries. Banking is just one of those primary needs.\nHowever progress is being made in that area. After the Hindu nationalist right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the 2014 election and Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, he initiated the Jan Dhan Yojana (Public Wealth Scheme) scheme aimed at giving the unbanked access to bank accounts.\nAccording to PwC, India\u2019s unbanked population has fallen from 557 million in 2011 to 233 million in 2014. However, a great deal of people still remain underserved or unserved by financial services sector.\nSimon Dixon, CEO BnkToTheFuture.com and Fund Manager Bitcoin Capital, says:\n \u201cWe feel it is a long term play, but we recently invested in UnoCoin - the largest Bitcoin exchange in India as we saw potential in creating financial services for the unbanked in India, a very large and active remittance market that could benefit from some cost savings, as well as one of the largest consumers of Gold where a a Bitcoin to Gold market may offer some end benefits to those in the Gold business.\u201d \n", "birthday": "2016-04-23T09:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-23 08:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 23}

He explains that in the financial world the realization of a decentralized system, one without a central clearing house or authority to act as the intermediary between transactions, is an ideal proposition for anonymity and personal privacy.\nKostinuk argues that the above described arrangement is not a practical approach to financial governance in the 21st century, not with data already present on money laundering and other illicit financial activity.\nTop 10 highest risk countries\nIn its 2015 Anti-Money Laundering Index, the Basel Institute on Governance, an independent not-for-profit competence centre that specializes in corruption prevention, public governance, anti-money laundering and more, reported on the the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing of countries worldwide.\nThe Basel Institute used 14 different indicators that deal with Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations, corruption, financial standards, political disclosure and rule of law to aggregate an overall score, which is then used to compile an index rated from highest risk to the lowest.\nIn examination of the top 10 on their list, the Basel Institute concludes:\n \u201cThe majority of high-risk countries are characterized by intrinsic weaknesses in both preventing and enforcing multiple aspects of the AML/CFT framework.\u201d \n      \nReasons raised refer to structural and functional vulnerabilities such as high rates of perceived corruption, lack of judicial strength, but also, and most relevant to the subject here, a lack of resources to control the financial system, and lack of public and financial transparency.\nBitcoin must be regulated and overseen in order to survive\nKostinuk points out that to enable the kind of security, trust and level playing field a public-use financial system requires, it must be accessible to overseers.\nFurther, that process, along with the system itself, must be as open and transparent as necessary to regulate and enforce against illicit activity.\nTo push further his argument, Kostinuk makes reference to R3CEV\u2019s announcement, which he describes as \u201can announcement in the waiting, the logical progression for the financial sector.\u201d\nIn this announcement contains the opinion that to make the step toward adopting next generation technology, that technology can\u2019t mean a fatal disruption of such a prominent pillar within the global system.\nFurther, it\u2019s the technology, not the semantics attached and associated, that is most important.\n\nBuilding trust and viability\nR3 is reverse-engineering, tackling the problem of adapting blockchain technology to fit to current constraints and frameworks.\nRichard G. Brown, chief technology officer at R3, writes:\n \"We are not building a blockchain. Unlike other designs in this space, our starting point is\u00a0individual agreements between firms. We reject the notion that all data should be copied to all participants, even if it is encrypted.\" \nMaintaining a decentralized structure, R3\u2019s latest technology helps adapt blockchain technology to long-established regulatory and supervisory frameworks.\nKey focuses of Corda that that help build trust and mainstream viability, include:\n A design that directly enables regulatory and supervisory observation of nodes; Support of a variety of consensus mechanisms; It is built on industry-standard tools and has no native cryptocurrency.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/privacy-enhancing-techniques-to-use-within-the-crypto-ecosystem", "title": " Privacy Enhancing Techniques To Use Within The Crypto Ecosystem ", "content": "Preventive measures must be employed by internet users, especially within the crypto ecosystem, to conquer existing threats to personal privacy. Cointelegraph has collected the most important ones.\nAdequate protection and abstinence\nMost internet users who complain about privacy invasion and security breaches admit to certain careless actions on their side. Such actions range between acts of negligence and curiosity.\nInadequate and out of date security setups on devices usually leave users exposed. Visiting untrusted sites and clicking on links that you are not sure of are also careless acts that can expose devices to bugs that may become harmful in the long run.\nKen Heutmaker, Senior Software Engineer at Keepkey, says that while it is possible to set up a general purpose computer that is secure and not subject to any known vulnerabilities, it is difficult to do it so that you are not potentially vulnerable to unknown attack vectors.\nThere will always be new vulnerabilities discovered in iOS, Android, Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. They are vulnerable because they are large, complex chunks of code. Mistakes are bound to happen and attack scenarios are bound to be overlooked.\nHeutmaker explains to Cointelegraph how to guard against this:\n \u201cSmall security devices are becoming essential to protecting personal security and privacy. Devices that are relatively simple are much less vulnerable because the attack surface is smaller. This approach allows you to lock down the most sensitive data in a highly controlled environment that is very difficult to attack examples of such device include YubiKey, and bitcoin wallet devices like KeepKey.\u201d \n\nNeed for raising the game\nDoug Miller, Head of Business Development & Strategic Alliances at Keepkey, points out that the elements which are responsible for security and privacy breaches change with time.\nIn order to fight this trend, more companies are getting back to secure hardware that can be managed and upgraded as needed, while adding policies and procedures such as dual authentication for signing many sorts of transactions.\nCommon sense and technical strategies\nDana L. Coe, Director of BitLox Ltd. (HK), says that with the increased use of the Internet in our daily life, people face serious threats to their personal privacy. Thus, special technologies come into action to protect our essential right. However, according to Coe, privacy can mean different things to different people.\nWhat many people used to consider \u201cprivate\u201d is now shared quite freely with the entire world. The question is more then, How can I keep the things I truly want private isolated from the things I want to share?\nThe options range from basic common sense up to elaborate isolation strategies.\nCoe explains to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cBasic measures would be to not use common login names for different services, not using major hub services for logins (Facebook, Google, Disqus, Twitter etc.), using ad blockers to prevent tracking and profile building (including denying most cookies) and various browser extensions designed to stop websites from setting tracking codes to follow you around.\u201d \n\nIntermediate and advanced measures\nCoe continues by saying that intermediate measures are somewhat more involved. This includes checking your browsers for their \u201cfingerprint\u201d - which may be much more distinctive than most people realize, as it may include not only the OS and browser you are using, but all the fonts installed on your system (plus any other plugins you have installed) and many more data points.\nDisabling JavaScript and removing all plugins goes a long way to \u201canonymizing\u201d your footprint on the Internet. The trade off is that most modern websites are of course heavily dependent on JavaScript. Activating these features can be done on a case-by-case basis if JavaScript is truly needed.\nAdvanced measures bring us to fully cloaking your identity. The Tor browser is the most popular method for this. However, just using Tor browser alone will not truly mask you properly. One must \u201cTorify\u201d the other apps that may be running and enable them to use the proxy Tor provides to the system.\nAdditionally, installing a very strict firewall/filter program (such as Little Snitch for Mac) will go a long way to suppressing extraneous communications that may publish your IP address or other data.\nThe Ultimate systems are \u201clive os\u201d images that are essentially single-use images. TailsOS is the best known of these. Every time it is booted, it is a fresh copy of the OS running plus all data is only sent over the Tor network.\nSecurity within crypto ecosystem", "birthday": "2016-04-18T11:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-18 10:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 18}

It is the world's largest manufacturer of ATMs with divisions in North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America.\nDevon Watson, Diebolds VP of Global Software Research and Development, is an owner of bitcoin and a big fan of the Blockchain with an insight into the whole ecosystem and protocol.\nBridging a mobile based world\nCointelegraph: I see in Copenhagen at Money2020 Diebold showcased one of its newest mobile driven banking concepts, a mobile driven ATM. Can you explain your reasons for bringing such an advanced concept to market?\nDevon Watson:\u00a0The more we see digital payments take off, the more cash actually gets used in society which is sort of an inverse phenomenon to most people's line of thinking and the simple reason is when there is a new digital payments innovation for your average consumer, it's now more and more convenient to move their payment types, whether that is physical cash or some sort of a digital transaction, back and forth from fiat to digital currency.\nThese new terminal designs and the new software that we\u2019ve been building helps to bridge a mobile based world. You know we will see this more and more over the next several years the cards in your wallet will be dematerialised into your phone and now that phone has to be the bridge for the consumer between their digital payment types, their banking experience and the need to deposit or withdraw their cash and other types of tenders.\n\nConditions for using Bitcoin\nCT: It says on your website, Diebold continues to shape the future of the mobile banking landscape by bridging the physical and digital worlds of cash in unprecedented ways. Have you any future plans to incorporate digital currencies such as bitcoin into this landscape?\nDW: That\u2019s a great question, I think it will probably happen. The question is when, so we are a provider to banks and retailers and others that want to deploy ATMs and software solutions to connect to their consumers and i think it\u2019s unclear to me at least market by market when bitcoin will join that ecosystem.\nI think if you look around the world you're starting to see the early signs of that being a payment option that providers want to adopt. When I\u2019m looking at certain countries in Latin America the usage of bitcoin there seems to have skyrocketed and that's going to lead in my opinion to more adoption by the incumbents.\nIf the government's support the usage of this payment type that\u2019s a good thing for its usage and if other providers within the ecosystem support it and make it easier that\u2019s a good thing for its usage and then we of course are ready to immediately follow along and make sure consumers can transact between those two mediums.\nBlockchain is no fit for a regular payment type\nCT: From researching your company it is obvious it has stood the test of time and is future proof being nearly 150 years old and still the biggest supplier of ATMs in the world. What are your views on Blockchain technology and have you plans to implement it into the Diebold platform in the future?\nDW: So when I look into my crystal ball, I came to Diebold previously from software start-ups and a venture capitalist background before that so you know I'm tasked with looking at how the world is changing over the next several years, making sure that we are proactively bringing the right solutions to the marketplace and to meet those opportunities and challenges.\nFor me when i look at Blockchain I actually see more promise in the technology for streamlining and adding security to inefficient processes right now. Do I think old payment types are going to run on a Blockchain? Probably not in the nearterm.\nBlockchain is a brilliant way to manage and orchestrate cryptocurrency. But when I try to shoehorn it into a regular existing payment type - probably not. You have trusted parties and scale issues and real-time problems etc, it\u2019s probably not the right fit.\nBut we are very bullish for medium and long term use against streamlining and securing document intensive processes. Whether that is capturing timestamping, securing the viewership of identity credentials, mortgage documentation or income proofs and things like that. Whether it\u2019s automation of notary services all of these heavy paper based things that we still do for government reasons or for banking reasons. I think those are prime candidates to be moved to automation which is great for me.

As the interest in the term \u2018blockchain\u2019 has been quite vivid lately, it is of the highest importance to provide a clear explanation of the concept to all interested out there. Wikipedia provides information on what the blockchain actually is.\nThe community nature of the platform means that all of the information that is stored there is contributed by volunteers, who have the rights to add and edit articles.\nWhen editors disagree about the content of a page repeatedly, they can override each other\u2019s contributions, sometimes making dubious and often constant additions and edits.\nPermissionless vs. permissioned\nThe disagreement between editors this time concerned the use of terms \u2018permissioned\u2019 and \u2018permissionless\u2019 and their application to the concept of blockchain.\nThe incident caught the attention of Jon Matonis, one of the most prominent members of the Bitcoin and blockchain community.\nMatonis expresses his concern on Twitter:\n \u201cThere\u2019s a Wikipedia edit war now going on to remove terms \u2018permissionless\u2019 and \u2018bitcoin\u2019 from the blockchain entry.\u201d \nPermissionless, or public accessibility, stands at the core of blockchain technology and is used to power the Bitcoin network, and most digital currency enthusiasts seem to be aware of this fact, therefore they see little to no sense to remove this type of information from its Wikipedia entry.\n\nWikipedia editing policy\nAccording to Wikipedia\u2019s editing policy, any edit warring can lead to certain sanctions.\nThe platform uses a bright-line rule called the three-revert rule (3RR). It states that an editor cannot perform more than three reverts on a single page within a 24-hour period, whether it involves adding the same or different material.\nAn edit or a series of edits that undo other editors\u2019 actions wholly or partially is considered a revert, which is often followed by a block of an edit warrior.\nIf the edit war develops, participants are invited to discuss the issue on the talk page and try to come to a consensus, which, however, did not happen in this particular case.\nSanctions were imposed against the user behind the incident, registered as Satoshilong. He was blocked from Wikipedia shortly after he started edit warring.\nThere is information that earlier this year he was trying to advertise his own products on the blockchain page on Wikipedia.\nOne drop creates a rainstorm\nSeveral debates spurred over the issue whether permissioned designs can be classified as \u2018blockchain designs\u2019.\nBitcoin community member Dooglus says:\n \u201cSorry to say it, but I tend to agree with the current version of the page.

Also irrelevant in the opinion of the court was the fact that Bitcoin was created much later than Estonian laws treating the \u201calternative means of payment\u201d.\nIntelligence asked owner to give info on customers\nIt all began in March 2014, when Dutch citizen resident in Estonia, Otto Albert de Voogd launched BTC.ee, a web based service that helped people buy and sell Bitcoin.\nHowever, over the course of time the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) became interested in the operations of de Voogd\u2019s bitcoin exchange service and asked him several oral and written questions.\nFIU asked to be given information on BTC.ee customers: their bank account numbers and the destination of where the money was being sent.\nThe Postimees Estonian News reports that Otto Albert decided to contest the FIU\u2019s competence to supervise Bitcoin transactions. We asked Otto Albert de Voogd of BTC.ee about exactly what happened and he said:\n \u201cBack in February 2014 I received a threatening e-mail from Estonian policeman Urmas Pai, that suggested they could start a criminal investigation against me. Subsequently he demanded that I provide them with information. I was not inclined to cooperate with an investigation against myself, so I declined to answer. I was told that if I did not answer I should file an appeal to the courts, which I did. The Supreme Court now ruled that I do not have the right to silence (similar to the US 5th amendment), because in their words, the risk of self-incrimination is either \"distant\" or \"theoretical\". I obviously disagree with that.\u201d \nOtto de Voogd: Estonia Violated AML Laws\nOtto is of the view that Estonia has violated EU Anti Money Laundering (AML) laws by unilaterally extending the EU AML law without giving a proper justification and registering the extension of the law with the EU.\nHe argues that proper procedures were not followed in enforcement of the law. He also says that he is \u2018irked\u2019 by the fact that Estonian police did not reveal its interpretation of the law till they contacted him. Instead of making their position clear, he says, the police went on to look for people \u201cto make an example off (sic)\u201d.\nRay Youssef, CEO at Paxful Inc, a company that operated from Estonia, doesn\u2019t agree with de Voogd\u2019s stand. \u201cWe don't have a crystal ball but this usually happens when businesses have a standoffish attitude towards the police, - says Youssef. - The police then take measures to enforce their right to police the situation, especially in such a small state like Estonia. We at Paxful left New York State for Estonian when the Bit License essentially out lawed a bitcoin startup's agility. We at Paxful have zero tolerance for anything that would stifle innovation and we can say with confidence that we feel safe operating in Estonia.\u201d\nEstonia wants to extend its Bitcoin policy EU-wide\nWhat effect the regulation of Bitcoin by Estonia will have on the cryptocurrency in Estonia is also a matter of perspective and interpretation, depending on who you ask.\nAccording to Otto de Voogd, restrictions imposed by Estonia mean that customers that trade more than 1,000 Euros worth of Bitcoins should be met literally face-to-face by representatives of exchanges and other parties involved.\nDe Voogd adds that the Estonian government had been aware of issues surrounding Bitcoin for more than two years but has chosen to do nothing to change the situation.\nEstonia imposed Value Added Tax (VAT) on the entire value of a Bitcoin transaction. De Voogd is of the view that the country\u2019s arguments in European Court of Justice (ECJ) for extension of this policy EU-wide is a huge setback for Bitcoin in the EU.", "birthday": "2016-04-15T09:37:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-15 08:37:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 15}

I think in five years time there'll be practically none. There will be some, there might always be some. But in terms of the number of transactions, in five years time the vast majority of the cash will be out of the system.\" \nCashless payments now\nIn 2015 cashless payments overtook the use of notes and coins for the first time in the United Kingdom, according to the industry body The Payments Council who claimed the use of cash by consumers, businesses and financial organisations fell to 48% of payments last year.\nThe remaining 52% was made up of electronic transactions, ranging from high-value transfers to debit card payments, as well as cheques.\nThe Payments Council is predicting that among consumers alone, the majority of transactions will be cashless in 2016, partly because younger consumers say they are less reliant on cash.\nA world beyond cash is a good thing\nThis of course will be right up MasterCards street as the more people paying by debit and credit card, the more business they believe will come their way.\nBarnett goes on to say that the idea of carrying coins \u2014 2p, 1p, 50p all cluttering up your pocket \u2014 will be an anachronism. It will seem as antediluvian as carrying a pouch full of gold.\nBarnett describes his idea of a perfect cashless world:\n \"We MasterCard think a world beyond cash is a good thing. Wherever you find high levels of cash \u2014 I'm not saying there's a causal relationship \u2014 but you get high levels of poverty, you get high levels of crime, difficulty in doing business, high levels of corruption, low levels of tax collection. I think in the end it's a good thing, a world beyond cash.\" \n\nTechnology facilitates changes in payment habits\nWhen asked by Business Insider why we are seeing a tipping point now as plastic has been around for decades, Barnett says:\n \"It's changing now faster than it ever has before due to big external factors \u2014 the first is technology.\u201d \nHe explains further that one of them is contactless, NFC (near field communication technology). That's been around for 7 or 8 years but it was really only when MasterCard got TfL (Transport for London) so people could start using their credit or debit card on the tube. It really took off.\nBarnett points out:\n \"We see that now spreading out. People get on this tube, then they buy their coffee, then they buy their lunch, then they buy a drink and so on. That grew five times in a year \u2014 500%. What it's doing is ripping cash out of the system very rapidly.\" \nLoyalty programmes\nWhen asked how much more convenient is it really to get your phone out of your pocket than to get your card and tap, Mr Barnett admits to Business Insider:", "birthday": "2016-04-14T19:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-14 18:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 14}

Intrinsic value, speculation, and human nature, experts say.\nEthereum, has shown an impressive market capitalization since being crowdfunded by fans in August 2014. The Blockchain smart contract platform at the time of writing, stands at over $658 mln, second only to Bitcoin.\nEthereum success factors\nJani Valjavec, the co-Founder at Cashila, speaking to Cointelegraph, says that there are a number of factors that have brought Ethereum to its current market cap.\nValjavec identifies the first factor as the peculiar stage of life of the entity. He says that Ethereum is approaching the stage of its next release cycle in its development, and this gave the assurance that the entity is very much alive and developing.\nThe second factor is what he described as the \u2018escape\u2019 from Bitcoin. He says that due to the ongoing argument whether all is well with Bitcoin or not, a good number of crypto users started shifting grounds from Bitcoin to Ether.\nHe identifies the third factor as the fact that a lot of people within the crypto world do have very high expectations about the projects that can be built on the Ethereum platform.\n\nIntrinsic value of Ethereum\nHaving identified these fundamental factors, Valjavec notes that as Ethereum grew in value, speculative traders joined the trade wagon and this affected the upward surge \u00a0in value. Nevertheless, he sees the major reason for Ethereum growth as its intrinsic value.\nValjavec says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cAll in all the primarily reason for growth was intrinsic value of Ethereum as a network and platform.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/tips-for-revamping-your-cryptocurrency-job-search-in-2016", "title": " Tips for Revamping Your Cryptocurrency Job Search in 2016 ", "content": "Cointelegraph has made a comprehensive list of the most useful ways to land a cryptocurrency job - from forums and job search aggregators to Facebook, freelance marketplaces and Angel.co.\nThe following sources and methods are selected on the basis of practical experience, and the information is up-to-date at the moment of writing this article. \u00a0\nForums and boards\nAny big forum on cryptocurrencies contains a \u201cJobs\u201d section. There you can find an interesting job offer or a freelance project and publish a post like \u201clooking for a job in a Bitcoin startup\u201d.\nThere is a lot of rubbish among the offers: offers of partnership, Click-to-Pay, and straightforward fraud.\nSometimes you can find a real treasure. You can get a freelance job at a good American rate, strike up promising acquaintances, and even arrange relocation to the USA, EC or Asia.\nHowever, job offers are updated quite seldom. Usually there are no guarantees of payment. Formal contracts are concluded on rare occasions, so there is a chance that you won\u2019t get paid at all. In most cases, you get offers of one-time (project) work from private customers.\nThe most interesting resources include:\n Jobs section on Reddit: There are not many offers, a lot of candidates, and reputation on Reddit can affect the choice of a contractor. But, as it always has been in freelancing, the capability to sell your services is crucial. For example, a small but strong team of developers succeeded in finding a number of very profitable orders here, despite the competition. Famous forum BitcoinTalk offers a lot of options for job searching: You can go directly to\u00a0the local Russian thread (this option is suitable for those who do not speak English), and for others, we recommend visiting other threads on the forum (there you can find interesting offers from European and Asian customers from time to time), using the search by word feature with \u201cjob\u201d, and looking into the Project Development section. Almost everybody here offers payment in cryptocurrency (which is Bitcoin in 99.9% of cases). Job offers for copywriters, translators and content managers are posted here quite often. Special board BitGigs is more alive than dead \u2013 new job offers are posted here almost every day. Here you can find job offers not only for developers, but for photographers, graphic designers, music editors and experts in video. \n\nFreelance marketplaces and job search aggregators\nUnfortunately, the largest and most popular resources like\u00a0Freelancer.com, UpWork, Fiverr do not provide an option to get paid in cryptocurrency. They just repeat\u00a0requests and feature requests from clients and contractors and a large number of projects related to cryptocurrencies.\nFiverr is far ahead the others however. In 2014, it added the option to top-up your account balance with Bitcoin, but there was no further progress.\nThus, when you are looking for a job which is paid in cryptocurrency, you will have to forget about the popular resources and turn your attention to special freelance marketplaces.\nThe special freelance marketplaces are the following:\n The\u00a0XBTFreelancer.com marketplace appeared in 2015 and actively promoted itself on theme-based resources including BitcoinTalk, but unfortunately it was occupied by clients and contractors from the developing world. For this reason, favorable offers are quite rare here. In all other respects, everything is standard for freelance marketplaces: the most reputable participants and those who have talent to sell their own services get the best orders. The Coinality.com aggregator collects requests from several HR resources and freelance marketplaces including UpWork. It is not clear why the latter are even needed, as they do not offer work for cryptocurrency. In all other respects, there are no issues: there is a lot of permanent work offered by unknown and large companies, direct contact details of employers are often published, search for offers by region is enabled, and remote work offers are posted. To find them, enter the \u201cAnywhere\u201d value in the location field of the form. BitcoinVacancy aggregates posts and advertisements from other resources and enables direct publishing of offers. Here you can mainly find permanent work for experts in project development. \nCryptocurrency companies and startups\nAs a nice bonus for employees, the great majority of companies dealing with cryptocurrencies (miners, exchanges, coin casino, etc.) offer payment in altcoins, including HashFlare, for example.\n\u0410ngel.co, a platform for startups in search of investment, has opened a Jobs section too. Different projects post their vacancies and search for specialists there.\nYou can find many options to work for a wage/interest/share in a project, vacancies with relocation, and remote jobs.\nTips for finding a job on Angel.co\nMethod 1: Filter projects and companies by tags (keywords) Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, or Dogecoin. You will see a table of search results where the \u201cView Jobs\u201d button will be displayed to the right of the companies looking for employees.\nMethod 2: Go to the Jobs section and filter jobs by the same tags. To find a remote job, add the keyword \u201cRemote OK\u201d.\nThere is no need to register on Angel.co. Don\u2019t waste your time filling in the profile and don\u2019t get in touch with the startups you liked via this service. There is little point in it unless you took part in development of at least 3 or 5 well-known projects represented on Angel.co, live in Silicon Valley and (preferably) personally know Zuckerberg.\nFilling the account form takes a lot of time but companies rarely reply via Angel.co. It is better to go to the respective company\u2019s website, find contact information there and contact them directly. Experience shows that it is much easier to get feedback and come to an agreement in this way.\nYou can also try to find a company\u2019s contact information on\u00a0CrunchBase. Go to the search section, use filters \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d, \u201cbitcoin\u201d, then go to the companies\u2019 websites and look for \u201cJobs\u201d or \u201cCareer\u201d sections.\n\nGetting hired via Facebook\nIt seems that via Facebook you can find everything you want, including work for cryptocurrency.\nAlas, it is most likely that a post with an attractive picture (a pretty naked woman holding a Bitcoin in her hands for example) and a text like \u201cFrontend developer looking for a job paid in Bitcoins\u201d will not have much effect.", "birthday": "2016-04-16T11:20:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-16 10:20:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 16}

Cointelegraph spoke with developers behind three regionally-centric cryptocurrencies (Auroracoin, Sterlingcoin, and Scotcoin) about their vision for modern currency designed for their respective peoples.\nDissatisfaction with financial system\nCryptocurrencies created for a specific people can save them from the central banking system.\nRecent scandals unearthed by the Panama Papers leak demonstrate corruption and hypocrisy from public officials, as well as a banking and governance system that serves the 1% at the expense of the poor and leaves the\u00a0rest at a disadvantage. This has led the citizens of many\u00a0countries\u00a0to feel disenfranchised, even prompting a prime minister\u00a0turnover\u00a0in Iceland.\nDissatisfaction with the way financial systems have been handled, as well as a simple desire to create something of value for a people, has given rise to a number of cryptocurrencies designed for a specific people.\nMost notable of these is\u00a0Auroracoin, an Icelandic cryptocurrency created a few years after the county\u2019s first great banking scandal, and has\u00a0nearly doubled\u00a0in price over the fresh round of scandals revealed in the Panama Papers.\nGiving cryptocurrency a local flavor\nA goal in creating a regional coin, according to lead\u00a0Scotcoin\u00a0developer Derek Nisbet, is to make the concept of cryptocurrency palatable at a local level.\n \u201cWhile Bitcoin and other leading cryptos are a true innovation for the global community, my feeling is that there are massive opportunities for 'local' cryptocurrencies, which directly impact and assist a community within smaller geographic areas. I don't see any reason why every local community could not have their own 'local' crypto, trading with BTC, Scotcoin & others, in the future.\u201d \nSteven Saxton, developer of\u00a0Sterlingcoin, believes that a cultural branding can help a cryptocurrency to gain adoption in ways a more general-purpose coin like Bitcoin may not.\n \u201cFor a currency to survive, it needs people to agree it has value. Using cultural bounds seems as a very strong glue to hold these communities together and the currency flowing. This glue will surely outlast fads of being simply something new. People are very tribal, it makes sense that currency is and will continue to be.\u201d \n\nDisseminating cryptocurrency in a focused group\nIceland provided a perfect test case for cryptocurrency, as there is currently no easy way for its citizens to acquire Bitcoin. According to\u00a0P\u00e9tur \u00c1rnason, Chairman, Aurar\u00e1\u00f0 foundation, this gave Auroracoin an edge in adoption.\n \u201cNo cryptocurrency in the world has been spread wider within a single nation than Auroracoin has. Not even Bitcoin can claim that.\u201d \nHlynur \u00de\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rnsson, board member of the Aurar\u00e1\u00f0 foundation, concurs, stating that \u201c10% of Icelanders claimed the coins in the airdrop, which makes it one of the most distributed coins out there.\u00a0\nHe also added:\n \u201cIf It won't work here, where we have all the right reasons for adopting crypto, where else in the world will it work.\u201d \nCryptoequity for a people\nThe idea of creating cryptoequity, not around a company but around a nation, was central to the idea of Scotcoin, according to Nisbet.\n \u201cThis was my plan from the outset, to 'helicopter' in a new medium of exchange that can directly assist the Scottish people, for the future.\u201d \nThis idea rings even more true for Auroracoin, as it was created for a country with a historically shaky currency and banking system. According to \u00c1rnason, it would create a new, and better, monetary system.\n \u201cThe monetary system we live with now enslaves the nation just as it does with the rest of the world. That is why Bitcoin was created. The Icelandic nation has just been heavily burned by the fatal flaws of modern age banking, in other words money printing. What better gift to give our children than a monetary system that will not skin them to the bone like our current system has done to us and the generations before us. Iceland has everything to gain by parting with the cancer we call a monetary system. Is Auroracoin the solution? Be it the solution or not, it is a step in the right direction and is a hell of a lot better than what we live with now.\u201d \nAn escape from government corruption\nThe creation of cryptocurrencies for nations to use allows for an alternative to a system that recently was shown to serve the global elite rather than the people.

The project is only 10 weeks old, but they have an app launching next week, and as Kemper says, \u201cthis is a fast moving movement and we can accomplish a lot with a little\u201d.\n\nA wallet that allows social payments\nCT: What was it that made you decide to start working on Social Wallet?\nKyle Kemper: I was one of the top users of ChangeTip and over the years have given out almost $15,000 in BTC on that platform and think the world of it. I was convinced that social payments were the future and that, instant, no fee, no minimum was huge.\nMy problem with ChangeTip was that, while it is an incredible platform, the user experience was underwhelming. I would sign people who knew nothing about bitcoin up and they would get lost almost right away in their system; there were a lot of features, a lot of terms that were new to them, and so many accounts to connect.\nSo I've given the feedback to ChangeTip and they appreciated it but never really implemented it. They have APIs though so I had been thinking about building a ChangeTip app that simplified it into 3 things, \u2018Send Money\u2019, \u2018Request Money\u2019, and \u2018Feed\u2019 - basically a Venmo, but with no banks and no borders.  I went to the NABTC in Miami in a business development role for Kraken. It was awesome. The industry has come so far since I started in 2013 and where it was once the wild west to me, it seemed that the foundation was laid and we just need a simple wallet to bring in the next wave of adopters.\nI heard about a hackathon being put on by the BitStop guys, and I talked to Marshall Swatt about my idea for it, and we brainstormed and did a technical assessment, and there was nothing stopping us.\nThe Thursday night of the hackathon I was at Chris Groshong's 55th floor Airbnb with a bunch of awesome bitcoiners, and this is where I met James Wilson. Him and I hit it off immediately and identified on so many levels. I picked him up the next morning and Marshall, James and I had brunch in Little Havana where we discussed the idea. \u00a0\"Let's call it Change, or Transfer...but really what it allows is social payments, so it's a social wallet....social wallet...social wallet...that's it.\" We looked over google and it was green so we had our name!\n\nA solution to global money transfer fees\nCT: So what happened at this hackathon?\nKK:\u00a0Our goal for the hackathon was to build a fully functioning app by the end of the event. The team consisted of myself, James Wilson, Marshall Swatt, and Alex Hudson. Alex is a native iOS developer who at the time knew nothing about bitcoin.\nWhen I started to realize the scope of what we were working on, I hopped on the phone and started activating the network to assist. One of the first priorities was graphic design and a friend connected us to a designer named David who I was told had worked on Instagram.\nHe spent 14 hours doing UX designs end to end and when he sent them over I was overcome with joy. The beauty, the simplicity...I showed it to people on the street and they were like, \"Oh it's like venom.\" That was music to my ears.", "birthday": "2016-04-09T15:10:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-09 14:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 9}

Resettlement of these new immigrants can prove challenging because of a difference in language, culture, and education. A new blockchain-based startup, Match & Teach Me (which recently won 1st prize in a competition for innovation at the National Technical University of Athens), aims to solve the education problem by psychometrically matching the learning and teaching styles of refugees and teachers for a more effective education process.\nCointelegraph spoke with Theodore Dimakarakos, the founder and CEO of Match & Teach Me, about the project\u2019s vision to help and teach refugees.\nBlockchain-based system\nCointelegraph: What gave you the idea for this project?\nTheodore Dimakarakos: For the last 3 years, me and my partners (3 of them are the most known university professors working in the field of psychometrics) are working on Match & Teach Me project, which will be launched this June. During the last few months Marinos brought the idea on the table of how could we use blockchain for education. On top of that, if you live in Greece nowadays, the daily number one news title is the refugee crisis. If you sum all these... here you are!\nCT: Which blockchain-based system are you using?\nTD:\u00a0We want to use the E.U.'s permissioned or federated blockchain solution, which has been announced to be materialized soon. Otherwise, it\u2019s going to be Ethereum- based on Microsoft's Azure (Match & Teach Me is on the BizSpark).\nRefugees are not stupid\nCT: This all seems cutting-edge and exciting, but many of the people you would be trying to help might not be very educated and may be wary of technology. Do you foresee this to be a challenge?\nTD: The vast majority of the refugees are from Syria. I can assure you that these people are not poorly educated, at all. On the contrary, many of them hold university degrees, and almost all of them have and operate perfectly a smartphone. Actually, a smartphone is the refuge's most valuable and important asset (navigation, communication, information, flashlight, etc.)\nCT: Do you see any problems arising because of government? Many refugees may be wary of not being allowed to stay. Do you think any would stay away from identification because of a fear of eventually being sent back?\nTD: If a European government wants to send back a refugee, why to bother to record him/her first? They can send him back on the spot. On the contrary, by recording them they could send the message:\u00a0\"Look, we will only accept legitimate refugees, those who have nothing to hide, those who don't have a secret agenda of their own. If you are one of them, you are welcome.\"", "birthday": "2016-04-10T15:45:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-10 14:45:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 10}
{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/our-biggest-competitor-is-cash-says-payu-co-founder", "title": " Our Biggest Competitor Is Cash, Says PayU Co-Founder ", "content": "Cointelegraph talks to Martin Schrimpff, Co-founder and Head of Global Sales of PayU. He is a big believer that Bitcoin can be a way to invest money. As currencies are changing dramatically around the world, it is a nice decentralized currency, completely out of any government control.\nMartin Schrimpff has founded 6 Tech companies with skills in the area of Business Development and strategic partnerships and experience in setting up operations in various latin American Countries like Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, Peru and Chile.\nWhat is PayU?\nPayU is a leading online payment service provider present in 16 high growth markets in Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Middle East and Africa. It offers \u00a0250+ payment methods and more than 1,400 payment specialists, and at the moment they have 100,000+ merchants\u2019 and millions of buyers.\nPayU see their strength in their local approach (valuing local language and culture).\u00a090% of their revenues come from local transactions.\nMartin Schrimpff explains to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cWe are specialising on the emerging markets, and we focus on those emerging markets. They are very exciting markets for us, and necessarily easy markets. We have gone to the local markets, we have 104 000 employees, out of which only 20 sit in our headquarters in Amsterdam, the rest is spread around the world. I'm Colombian, our CEO is French. Our company is really international.\u201d \nWhat they do is they provide services locally - credit cards and cash payments, ecommerce merchants. Recently, in last year and a half they have such rave payments and hot markets which are hard to get into. They service global merchants like Google, AirBnB, Booking.com, Sky, Facebook.\nServing these global merchants, PayU are enabling cross border payments. They are enabling merchants selling their products or services without necessarily having a legal entity in the local markets to penetrate these markets.\nSchirmpff says that people don't know much about PayU but as a global brand they are slowly getting to be known now.\n\nOur biggest competitor is cash\nPayU started as a company back in\u00a02000-2001. And there has always been competition locally. However, their biggest competitor is cash.\nMartic Schrimpff says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cOur biggest competitor is cash as a payment method. There are competitors locally, however there's no bigger player focusing on the market where we are focused. In that sense we are pretty unique. We partner with a lot of companies, so we don't even see them as our direct competitors.\u201d \nUnderstanding local markets is the key\nPayU is \u201cmulti-local\u201d and has people on the ground that tend to understand local markets. According to Schrimpff, if you have 250 payment options, they have connected to all of those payment options directly.\nSchrimpff explains:\n \u201cWhen I see other players that claim that they have 300 payment options, I get a little skeptical, because they don't have those direct relationship like we do, cause we've gone local, it has taken us 14 years and we really have something that other players just don't have in that sense. That gives us better pool rates, full control of the tools that we are able to use. We are in a better position to service all those global merchants.\u201d \nThe future of B2B payment market\nCo-founder of PayU thinks that B2B payment market\u00a0has been advancing quite a lot, and the future looks more and more bright for seamless payments. In his view, Uber was the first one to show how seamless payments can happen through the fact that you can just get out of the car without having to take out your wallet.\nSchrimpff clarifies:\n \u201cI am a big believer in that. There is now Apple Pay, Samsung Pay - there is a lot evolving around seamless payments. As a B2B player we are continuously making sure that we are maximizing approval rates and payments for our B2B businesses.\u201d \nThe big change that PayU is making, apart from concentrating more and more on merchant markets, is getting more into other FinTech spaces like credit, consumer credit, SMB credit. As Schrimpff mentioned before, their biggest challenge is cash.\nSchrimpff says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cFor example, if we take Latin America, 50% of all payments are cash. We have got to alter the structure we have and give better payment solutions in those markets, that will take the whole structure to a new digital space of payments, and facilitate merchants to have more seamless transactions\". \nAt the moment 50% of these people buy something online, get out of the house, go and take cash, come back, and they are willing to do that. If PayU gives them the right solutions, like one-click buy, it will make things easier.", "birthday": "2016-04-10T12:50:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-10 11:50:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 10}

It is often confused with the core innovation that Bitcoin introduced. Founded in 2011, the company is one of the oldest and biggest Bitcoin\u2019s companies.\nExperiencing a rapid expansion in the last few years, the company has passed 6.7 million users, and the amount of wallets created on the platform is constantly increasing.\nThe most popular block explorer\nNicolas Cary says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cWeb wallet is just a way for someone to safely and securely send and receive Bitcoin. We also have a website called Blockchain.info where you can follow all the transactions that are happening in the Bitcoin network, you can get market and price information and even pull down data if you want to do some interesting statistical work. For all the nerds out there we have developed a platform that allows enterprises and software programmers to build great things on top of the bitcoin protocol\u201d. \nIt is not the first time Blockchain has represented the brand at Money 20/20. There are always lots of discussions going on concerning blockchain technology, and this year is no exception.\nNicolas Cary admits that there has been a big adjustment in the field during the last couple of years:\n \u201cEveryone is getting more and more curious about what is going to happen. At the same time there is a lot of misinformation and we have to come and demystify what Bitcoin is about and why blockchain technology is so important. From my perspective the two are very intertwined. There are a lot of people here that see the benefits of this utility but they are not ready to accept how it functionally works.\u201d \nEmerging challenges and opportunities\nBlockchain in particular has made incredible progress over the past three years. It has very much succeeded in expanding its presence in the market, attracting new consumers. The industry in general has been developing as well, following huge amounts of investment, and the concentration of human capital in Bitcoin companies.\u00a0\nNicolas Cary says:\n \u201cWe are looking forward into the future and we think we are going to continue to be able to provide financial services for a millions of people around the world and there is no financial system on the planet that can compete with that today. The use-cases for a Bitcoin continue to evolve. Right now we see cross border payments as having a great potential, as well as digital payments for digital goods being very popular - people buying songs online, people buying digital content \u00a0and games, things like that\u201d. \nHe sees microtransactions as an interesting and evolving use-case of Bitcoin. However, it is still rare, because of the underdevelopment in fee-structures and scaling protocols.\n\nThe future of the blockchain\nAnalyzing the future of the blockchain, Nicolas Cary mentions one of the biggest challenges faced by the technology, regulations.\nHe says:\n \u201cIt's hard to regulate the blockchain technology in this sense, it's not centralized, there's no overall committees, or the general authority. However, it's already regulated by its open source nature, and the fact that it's regulated by mathematics.\u201d \nThe reality, however, is often different from our plans and aspirations. Many banks and other financial institutions do not feel certain about Bitcoin and its future, and most of the time, they are frightened to even try using it. Companies like Microsoft and Visa have made attempts to explore the field, but are still trying to figure out strategies that would work best.\nBlockchain is creating the tools necessary to integrate the big players in this space, although this hasn't been a big worry for those in the US. Major companies like Microsoft, Overstock, Dell, Wordpress, Wikipedia, which represent hundreds of billions of dollars of market composition, have already begun working with Bitcoin companies. They are accepting payments in Bitcoin, and are building services on top of the cryptocurrency. These companies aren\u2019t worried about the future of Bitcoin, so hopefully more companies will take this to mean the cryptocurrency is worthy of investment.\nCompetition means growth\nThe public\u2019s opinion of Bitcoin varies significantly, and many associate it exclusively with shady dealings. There has been a great deal of negativity and discussion over the moral aspects of digital currency in the news at various points in time. Nicolas Cary suggests that the public takes a look at the fundamental technology itself. One will then realize that the technology simply lacks morality.\nCary says:\n \u201cJust like Google Maps doesn't care whether you use it to plan a picnic with your husband in the park or whether we are all conspired to plan a getaway after a bank robbery. The technology itself doesn't matter, it's people who use it and how they use it that matter, and that's what is the most important. I think that allowing anybody in the world instantly to transact with anybody else just as easily as sending an email is a really important thing that we need for the age of the Internet\u201d. \nIndeed, times change and the development of new technologies is spurred by people\u2019s demands and interests. What at first was considered odd, eventually becomes the norm.\nNicolas Cary explains:\n \u201cWhen rock'n'roll first came out, they said it would rotten your teeth and pollute your mind. It was really scary new sound, and what happens is people get more comfortable with things.\u201d \nAn open financial protocol will open new markets and decrease the transaction costs\nRegarding the development of Bitcoin in the longer term, Nicolas sees building an open financial protocol for digital value transfer as being one of the central focuses. He believes that it will be able to significantly change the financial sphere and open new markets and consumer groups that have been completely ignored. It will significantly decrease the transaction costs and make the whole system more efficient.", "birthday": "2016-04-11T11:28:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-11 10:28:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 11}

As does his preference for general terms, vague language, and long windedness.\nWright\u2019s now deleted Linkedin profile contains 26 A4 sized pages and terms such as \u201cEncryption Techniology\u201d and \u201ccontinential kitchens\u201d. In a now deleted purported Letter of Endorsement from SGI, a document Cloudcroft\u2019s website, a company owned by Wright, claims was written by SGI\u2019s Director, Greg McKeon, it reads: \u201c, and continues to perform through innovation is very synergistic.\u201d DeMorgan\u2019s now deleted website, a company owned by Wright, states: \u201cwe have completed several Bitcoin based research projects that have lasted over and are now ready to start commercialising.\u201d\nSuch atrocious writing, even in official or semi-official documents where nothing less than perfect spelling and grammar is expected, suggests Wright simply cannot spell or lacks attention to detail. Contrast the above with Satoshi\u2019s flawless, concise, succinct and concrete writing.\n\n-\u00a0Craig Steven Wright\n\u201cDangerous\u201d and \u201cIgnorant\u201d\nAlthough the above in itself is sufficient to strongly suggest Wright is not Satoshi, it is only the surface. In a damning post on the security mailing list on February the 9th 2010, when Satoshi was still writing on bitcoin related forums, Timothy M. Mullen, a computer and information security expert with more than 30 years of experience who has worked for Microsoft, the U.S Air Force and the U.S Court System as well as written a number of books on the subject with one reviewer stating that \u201c[t]he introduction for Thor\u2019s Microsoft Security Bible by Timothy \"Thor\" Mullen is one of the best I have read of any security related books\u201d, Mullen had enough. In publicly calling out Craig Wright, who claimed in his now deleted website that he is \u201cthe most highly accredited Global Information Security Professional\", Mullen states:\n \u201cPeople like you are dangerous and need to be exposed before someone in a position of power actually believes that you know what you are talking about.\u201d \nThe unqualified statement was made in reply to a post by Craig Wright where he claims that he can quantify the \u201cprobability of compromise\u201d with a simple formula:\n \u201cWhere a system uses an SMS response with a separate system (such as a web page), the probability that the banking user is compromised and a fraud is committed, P(Compromise), can be calculated as: P(Compromise) = P(C.SMS) x P(C.PIN) Where: P(C.SMS) is the probability of compromising the SMS function and\u00a0P(C.PIN) is the compromise of the user authentication method [sic] The user can be compromised by Trojan apps, poor pins that are pasted to a monitor etc.\u201d \nThe above may sound reasonable to someone unfamiliar with information security. However, it was sufficient to convince Muller that Wright was \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cignorant\u201d to the point where he states:\n \u201cNot only will I take your money, and ruin your reputation in this bet, but I'll tell you how I will do it UP FRONT. \u00a0If I have someone show up at the door with a shotgun and ask for the hardware, do I win? \u2026 Where in your formula do you plug that in?\u201d \nMuller\u2019s overall assessment is backed by Carl Jongsma, a security expert at Sunnet Beskerming, who states:\n \u201cI read through the post that Craig has placed online and there are a couple of seemingly critical faults in the model that have a massive effect on the overall reliability / strength against attack / resilience\u2026 that a system displays.\u201d \nATO Levies an Almost $2 Million Penalty Fine\nYet, this is still only the surface. Wright claimed on Cloudcroft\u2019s website, a company he owns, that he has a supercomputer with parts manufactured by SGI, the \u201ctrusted leader in high performance computing\u201d according to SGI\u2019s website. In a further press release, DeMorgan Ltd. announced that they are \u201celigible to receive up to approximately $54,000,000 R&D cash rebate\u201d from the Australian Tax Office (ATO) which has allowed DeMorgan to \u201ctune our Supercomputers\u201d. It further states that:\n \u201cMr McKeon of SGI has stated that they \u201clook forward to a long, sustained relationship\u201d and that together our companies will reach the highest ranks of the Top500 list.\u201d \nHowever, SGI has categorically denied any relationship with Wright. In a statement to ZDNet, Cassio Conceicao, SGI EVP and chief operating officer stated:\n \"Cloudcroft has never been an SGI customer and SGI has no relationship with Cloudcroft CEO Craig Steven Wright.\" \nIt may well be the case, therefore, that the Letter in Support is fabricated, particularly as it contains a number of grammatical and spelling errors. Furthermore, there are no pictures or any evidence that the supercomputer exists except for a course titled Programming on Supercomputers by Charles Sturt University, a lower tier Australian university with a ranking of 701+. The course is peculiar in itself. It contains a number of specialised topics that would take at least a semester, such as Distributed Computing: Power Grid, Thread Programming, Parallel Programming Models and Paradigms, C Programming on MIC (Xeon Phi) and many more. Yet it claims to cover them all in about four hours. Although there are videos, none of them show a supercomputer and individuals who seem to have worked with supercomputer have stated in public posts that Wright\u2019s descriptions of the supercomputer and its workings are \u201claughable\u201d.\nIt is highly likely therefore that the supercomputer does not exist. The Australian Tax Office (ATO)\u2019s \u201cserious evasion and criminal investigations unit\u201d has opened an investigation on potential fraud. They may be interested in the supercomputer or Hotwire Ltd, a company mainly owned by Wright, or both.\nHotwire was meant to acquire various e-learning and e-payment systems software. However, it went into administration in 2014 because, according to a report by the administrators in May 2014, ATO \u201cwithheld\u201d $3.1 million in Goods and Services Tax (\u201cGST\u201d) refunds as it required \u201cfurther verification of transactions\u201d.", "birthday": "2016-04-11T18:01:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-11 17:01:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 11}

", "content": "Cointelegraph spoke to experts from Safe Cash Payment Technologies, Inc, Bitfortip.com, SatoshiPay.io, PopChest.com and Fuzo to learn their views on micropayments.\nGreat expectations\nNicholas Negroponte, head of the MIT Media Laboratory, predicted in 1998 that we were going to see, within the next year, an extraordinary movement in the web of systems for micropayments. Nowadays, Andreas Antonopoulos is still trying to raise awareness among people about the possibilities offered by the micropayment system.\nWalter Isaacson, CEO at Aspen Institute, writes:\n \u201cA flourishing digital economy based on easy payments might also encourage the invention of new forms of media: collaboratively created role-playing games, interactive online plays and novels, and new ways to combine art and music and narrative.\u201d \nChris Kitze, CEO at Safe Cash Payment Technologies, Inc, thinks that micropayments may be a viable business model as consumer behavior has changed. The existing credit card rails can only be used for funding a stored value account that is debited in tiny amounts, while the blockchain can do this quite easily.\nMicropayment offers possibilities for content producers \u00a0\nAccording to Panagiotis Pollis, founder of Bitfortip.com, micropayments were first conceived in discussions in the mid 90's. Several companies were very interested on the idea, and they even began to develop platforms for them. But back then, the suspensory factor was the cost of handling such transactions as they were too low, and that wasn't profitable for the financial institutions.\nPollis continues by saying that there is also an old Stanford paper that says that after research regarding the safety of the transactions, complications with a variety of different software (download, authenticating users etc.) and the concern of user anonymity being tracked even more with their spending, they deemed micropayments not as beneficial as initially thought to be. Then Bitcoin came into the picture, and everyone was backing the idea more than ever before.\nPanagiotis Pollis explains to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cWe see micropayments being used online. Publishers have come to a clever solution to engage a wider audience allowing the sale of just one article. People are not interested in purchasing an entire subscription. Another way that they use is providing an ad free content in exchange for a small fee.\u201d \nMobile game developers have also taken advantage of micropayments by providing freemium games. In the end, they are not only using ads, but also generating more revenue with this business model. Music artists also benefit from micropayments by not forcing anyone to buy their entire latest album, but simply just one track. So the number of their potential customers is increasing.\nPollis says:\n \u201cMy website bitfortip.com also takes advantage of micropayments by giving the incentive for people to search something online in exchange for a bitcoin tip. Eventually, it is certain that micropayments will catch on and they will prove to be a viable business model.\u201d \n\nInvestors are excited about micropayments\nMeinhard Benn, founder of SatoshiPay.io, explains that it is too early on to say if micropayments are viable or not. It certainly is a topic that every web user can relate to, and that investors are excited about, because of the high growth potential a micro or nanopayment \u00a0company has.\nBenn says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cWe have plans to offer payment tools for images, file/media downloads and streams. More services will appear that use Bitcoin in the background, without the user even realizing. We recently received a total \u20ac360K to make this happen.\u201d \nMicropayments allow a smooth video-on-demand experience with no signups", "birthday": "2016-04-12T10:05:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-12 09:05:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 12}

Operating in more than 200 countries with a global network of more than 350,000 agent locations, it is the world\u2019s second largest provider of money transfers. MoneyGram is focusing on transferring money across borders. The main goal is to make it as easy and efficient as possible to help people live better lives.\nConsistent growth of money transferring market\nMoneyGram is currently number two in the world by the size of market share. The competitive environment has always been very strong and taking a leading position has been challenging at times. Peter Ohser explains to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cThere is a competition in every country at different levels, and the competitive landscape is evolving with new digital tech companies entering the market and people coming in and providing different solutions. It has been quite consistent, there is nothing really changing dramatically. We are definitely seeing the convergence of technology and aspiration to make things better for consumers, however, in a lot of markets it is still unfeasible and regulatory pressures are still restricting some of the flow\u201d. \nBuilding consumers\u2019 \u00a0trust is important\nA number of factors allowed MoneyGram to continue gaining success on the money transfers market and distinguish itself among competitors. MoneyGram was able to spread across the globe and create ubiquitous opportunities to send money in various regions, which significantly expands the use-case of the product. Likewise, the company has spent a lot of time building it\u2019s brand and acquiring people\u2019s trust.\nPeter Ohser says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cWhen you move money it\u2019s all about the trust. Part of the biggest challenge in fintech community is that they don\u2019t have a brand and people don\u2019t know if they can trust. If something goes wrong, how is it going to work for the customer to get his money back? Especially if you don\u2019t have a lot of money, you care about that a lot. You are scared to try different things, because something might go wrong. Building a reputation of a brand, delivering on that premise every day and continuing to focus on making people\u2019s lives better, making them happy with the product - that is what important\u201d. \n\nExpanding partnerships to provide better solutions\nMoneyGram is a financial technology company where everything is focused around accessing, providing, and integrating technology solutions. The company is constantly working on developing new and efficient solutions for money transferring, connecting with mobile devices, integrating into mobile e-wallets, and expanding its role on the market. Recently MoneyGram has been working hard exploring markets in Africa and other parts of the World. The company is actively partnering with the FinTech community to help enable them to provide cross border money transfers in a compliant and faster way.\nBeing one of the biggest money transfer companies in the world, MoneyGram keeps an open eye to the latest innovations in FinTech community, including recent developments in blockchain and related technologies.\nPeter Ohser says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cBlockchain is an amazing technology, however, people haven\u2019t figured out how to apply blockchain. I think there\u2019s a belief that it can provide some solutions when it comes to improvement of the efficiency of remittance system, and the question is who will be the first one to implement these solutions.

Normal laws\u00a0in regards to civil and criminal liability, of course, still apply. In explaining, Woolard stated:\n \u201cThese letters aim to give firms comfort that as long as they deal with us openly, keep to the agreed\u00a0testing parameters and treat customers fairly, we accept that unexpected issues may arise and will\u00a0not take disciplinary action.\u201d \nSimilar to accelerators\nSignalling a highly innovative and open approach, Woolard stated that the sandbox will run \u201cnot\u00a0dissimilar to how accelerators operate\u201d, with two cohorts a year.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-exchange-igot-is-on-the-verge-of-collapse", "title": " Bitcoin Exchange Igot Is On The Verge Of Collapse ", "content": "The Australia-based Bitcoin exchange Igot has been struggling to completely deliver on operations with Bitcoins or refund customers their money. \u00a0\nThe company was founded in 2013 and offered exchange services in 40 different countries, including the ability to buy and sell Bitcoins, remittance services, futures tradings and merchant services.\nHowever, it is unclear whether the company actually signed up merchants and provided listed services beside basic buy/sell exchange services, as was advertised by the company.\nShady background of Igot Bitcoin exchange\nThere are certain concerns about the background of the company. It is referred to as an Australia-based company registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC/ABN: 600 161 233), in Melbourne in June, almost 12 months after it was founded.\nIn addition to this, there are some questions about the contact address of the company, with the main office listed in Adelaide, and agent offices in Ljubljana, Slovenia; Kowloon, Hong Kong; Singapore and Bangalore, India.\nResearch by SiliconANGLE showed that these are all virtual and therefore not legitimate offices.\nQuestionable reputation\nIgot\u2019s main goal was to make operations with Bitcoin easy, simple and safe. So far the company managed to attract attention by being at the center of huge misunderstandings and failing to fulfill its obligations towards customers.\nIn May last year, the Bitcoin exchange experienced delays for bitcoin and fiat currency withdrawals, which were mainly associated with major platform updates. To calm worrying customers, Igot offered reduced trading fees and other complementary measures.\nLater in June, Igot was victim to a Distributed Denial of Service Attack and came under fire once again with dozens of customers and clients complaining about delays with their withdrawals, expressing doubts about the trustworthiness of the company and claiming that they were robbed.\nThere have been some heated discussions going on on social media, including Facebook, Twitter and Reddit with most users expressing their dissatisfaction about the way Igot is handling the situation.\nFor instance, a Bitcoin community member who invested a significant amount of money in Bitcoin through the Igot platform says on Reddit:\n \u201cIgot is not being honest and transparent. We are given many different reasons and explanations behind the problem that don\u2019t really fit together\u201d. \nCommenting on delays with withdrawals, Igot\u2019s founder and CEO, Rick Day, at that time claimed that the situation was under control and there was no reason to worry about company owners escaping with all the investments.\nMurky financial performance\nIn June 2014 a founder of Igot expressed his excitement about an agreement with Jesse Chenard, who was invited to partner with the company as a major investor and company advisor. After a thorough analysis of the company\u2019s finances, Chenard found that Igot was not buying enough bitcoins for the money it was taking in.\nJesse Chenard tells ABC:\n \u201cWhat people thought they had bought with their Australian dollars or Indian rupees, or whatever currency they were dealing in - wasn\u2019t actually bought\u201d. \nSoon after Chenard stopped advising for Igot and made a decision not to invest in the company.\nFor now, Igot has ceased trading with users, and stopped all public communications, whilst not responding to users\u2019 complaints. Was it all a big scam?\nFrom skepticism to enthusiasm and back\nWith growing interest in cryptocurrencies and rapid development of blockchain technologies underpinning them, skepticism among consumers and financial institutions has given way to enthusiasm.\nThe European Union recognized it as a currency, Germany classified it as private money, and Finland classified it as a commodity, while technology giant Microsoft started collaborating with a number of banks developing blockchain technology potentially for the use of financial services.\nHowever, innovations carry significant challenges and concerns along with opportunities. One of the most important concerns here is security and trust.\nThe fall of MtGox has brought some uncertainty as to how reputable exchanges are, and many traders interested in making investments in cryptocurrencies have become very wary of these exchanges. When trusting a bitcoin exchange with money, everybody wants to be sure that their security measures are of the utmost importance.\nAll Bitcoin exchanges share certain key functionality, however their effectiveness as trading networks as well as the security measures they introduce vary significantly.\nCreating a safer environment together\nThere is very little government regulation around bitcoin and a lot remains to be done in that area. Regulatory discussions around digital currencies have really ramped up during the last few years, and many cryptocurrency experts are positive about further development of regulatory frameworks, which will only help the community\u2019s Bitcoin legitimization efforts and find a balance between risks and business opportunities.\nEarlier this month, Cointelegraph spoke with Peter Ohser, EVP of MoneyGram at Europe Money 20/20, to discuss the future of blockchain technology and the contribution it could make in the development of financial services.", "birthday": "2016-04-12T17:20:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-12 16:20:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 12}

Because of the advent of the internet, people can work almost anywhere in the world and have almost the same level of interaction with co-workers, bosses and employees as they would in person. However, most innovation around payroll has focused on paying domestic employees, like what you see going on with Gusto.\u201d \nAccording to Chester, this means that when companies pay their distributed workforces, they are just using systems such as the international wire system or paypal. The average cost of sending payments across borders through these traditional payment methods is 4 to 14 days and 8%. By leveraging virtual currencies, these costs can be brought down to same or next day settlements and costs as low as 1%.\n\nNew Innovation to the rescue\nAccording to the Bitwage Blog, Airbitz and Bitwage have started collaborating along with others like Coinomi, and Multibit to make getting paid a lot more similar internationally and across borders as it is for domestic workers.\nIn fact one of the greatest challenge that people transacting through cryptocurrencies face today is that while it is quite easy to give your wallet address to a website (for example an employer\u2019s website), it is very difficult for you to send an address directly to a website and request a payment.\nThe Airbitz and Bitwage solution is specifically exploiting Request for Payment Address Protocol, an extension to the Bitcoin protocol to address this issue. Airbitz\u2019s CEO Paul Puey has issued a Youtube video that explains how they will implement it.\n  \nThe system works rather simply as explained on the Bitwage blog and takes out all the usual cutting,copying and pasting out of the equation:\n Go to the scan option in your Airbitz wallet Scan the QR code on Bitwage\u2019s Choose Distribution Page Choose the Airbitz app and select the wallet to send to Bitwage Confirm and you will be redirected to a mobile browser Complete the two factor authentication Your wallet is saved as the user\u2019s distribution method. \nIf you would like to see screenshots, they are available here.\nRoadblocks in the way of crypto salaries\nEverything has its upside and then a potential downside. While the cryptosystem is great for saving costs associated with money transfers and for saving on time, there are concerns. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are very volatile.\nWhen we talked with Jonathan Chester, he concurred that some people may have concerns about cryptocurrency volatility but on the other side he pointed out that cryptocurrencies also break the oligopoly of the correspondent banking system and brings democracy on board.\nHe pointed out that the bigger challenge remains liquidity as in some countries, you simply just cannot send $1m into without crashing the local bitcoin economy. Chester is also of the view that in countries with unreliable banking systems such as Greece and Argentina, Bitcoin already has a role to play when it comes to receiving wages.\nHis company Bitwage offers a system that allows people to use the cryptonetwork to get paid but receive money in local currencies or keep money stored in a mix of different currencies.\nWe also talked with Aaron Lasher, CMO of Breadwallet who has a unique take on Bitcoin\u2019s volatility and receiving wages in this cryptocurrency.", "birthday": "2016-04-13T14:40:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-13 13:40:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 13}

However, no venturing into Bitcoin or Blockchain is on the horizon.\nAirbnb spokesperson reveals to Cointelegraph:\n \"We are thrilled to bring some members of the ChangeTip team on as a part of Airbnb \u00a0and joining the engineering team working on building our infrastructure. We are not acquiring the assets of the company, nor do we have any plans to incorporate Bitcoin into the Airbnb \u00a0ecosystem.\u201d \nAirbnb is a company whose business model has been subject to much debate. They have been a game changer in terms of how people stay when they travel. Airbnb began their operations \u00a0in August of 2008, and the San Francisco based company is already a household name. Airbnb \u00a0now has accommodations in 34,000 cities spread over 190 countries and they claim to have served over 60 million guests.\nWhat started the buzz?\nAccording to Business Insider, Airbnb has gone ahead and \u201cacqui-hired\u201d seven engineers from CoinChange, the company that is responsible for ChangeTip.\nThis has caused quite a stir and there is talk that Airbnb maybe exploring the use of Bitcoin technology, or at least have an interest in the workings of blockchain and other associated Bitcoin technology.\nIt is noteworthy to mention that ChangeTip runs a system that allows users to tip each other with cryptocurrencies on Twitter and Reddit.\nSince Airbnb has only acquired staff and none of the infrastructure or assets of CoinChange, there is no reason to believe that they are going to be introducing any tipping service as of now.\nData and trust\nBy all appearances it seemed that leveraging the power of its data was the main interest of Airbnb, and Airbnb \u00a0has a lot of data. However, the business that Airbnb is in requires a huge element of trust. We know now though that they may not be headed in that direction.\nAirbnb hosting involves giving your house to a stranger and for the guest. It means staying in a strange environment potentially with other strangers.\nInterestingly, the focus of trust when it comes to data is made clear by the Airbnb\u00a0blog which says:\n \u201cHow best to support trust\u200a\u2014\u200aparticularly between groups of people who may not have the opportunity to interact with each other on a daily basis\u200a\u2014\u200ais a core research topic for our data science and experience research teams.\u201d \n\nQuest for trusted form of digital identity\nBlockchain, the technology on which Bitcoin operates can be \u00a0theoretically useful for Airbnb \u00a0because it can be used to create a \u201ctrusted form of digital identity\u201d.\nImagine a world in which Airbnb could leverage its huge record of users, and share this data in some form with partners. In this way a partner company would have been able to check on the digital reputation of an Airbnb guest for example and see if they are willing to extend their services to this user.\nIt is clear that they have no such plans, at least officially.\nThere are, however, challenges in this area as there is the question of privacy and security.\nMarcus Andrade, the CEO of Aten Group, LTD a London based company, says to Cointelegraph:", "birthday": "2016-04-13T18:03:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-13 17:03:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 13}

They have helped shape bitcoin into what it is today: well regulated, accessible and safer than ever.\nAs Bitcoin marches on to becoming more publicly accessible, regulated, and acceptable to the general public, it is sometimes good to look back on how we got to where we are today. Throughout it's rather short but storied history, Bitcoin has managed to attract a lot of attention. Not only from people looking at the potential applications for decentralized currency, but likewise those looking to make a quick buck. In this article we examine what we believe to be the 10 biggest fails in Crypto.\n#10: Money laundering and funding criminals with illegal Bitcoin exchanges\nMoney laundering is a large problem in the modern era. It cuts tax revenue and it helps facilitate the growth of large-scale illegal enterprises.\nIt's precisely for these reasons that the operators of the Bitcoin exchange Coin.MX, Anthony R. Murgio and Yuri Lebedev, are facing charges of operating an illegal exchange while the former of the two is also being hit with money laundering charges. As the FBI claims, Murgio knowingly exchanged Bitcoins for individuals he knew to be involved in illegal activities. Murgio faces up to 35 years in prison, while Lebedev faces up to ten years.\nNew York Times writes:\n \u201dFederal authorities contend that Mr. Murgio\u2019s company, Coin.mx, allowed online criminals to illegally exchange the digital currency bitcoin for cash as part of a money-laundering scheme.\u201d \n#9: Extortion demands in Bitcoin\nISIS in recent years has pervaded media, the radical terrorist organization has become a major international threat. Supporters of the regime of Bashar Al-Assad, which is currently fighting the ISIS calling themselves the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA), has been reported sending threatening emails containing personal information of the recipient, demanding a ransom in Bitcoin to be paid, or else one of the recipients family members will be murdered.\nHowever, according to reports, it seems likely that this is all an elaborate scam, basing itself in social engineering and the fear that the media has instilled. According to a press release of the Justice Department of the United States of America, two of the members of the SEA have been added to the most wanted list of the FBI.\nIn a press release dated March 22, 2016, Assistant Attorney General Carlin says that some of the activity of the SEA seeks to harm the economic and national security of the US and that members of SEA have used extortion to extract money from \u201claw-abiding people all over the world\u201d.\n#8: Ponzi and MLM schemes\nCryptocurrencies have hurdles to climb over - thanks to previous scams, and companies like OneCoin do not help. The purported cryptocurrency based out of Bulgaria has been revealed by an insider source as a massive Ponzi scheme operated by an individual with ties to local criminal circles. Supported by a web of paper companies, created to add legitimacy to OneCoin, the pyramid scheme seeks to entice unaware and gullible individuals.\nThe Financial Supervision Commission has issued a warning in regards to the company which broadly states that the FSC informs investors and consumers that acquisition, trading and payment of OneCoin are not governed by existing EU and national laws on capital markets.\nEric Grill, CEO of Coinoutlet, says to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cOneCoin doesn't need a blockchain since it is closed source and the only place to buy and sell it is via their own internal exchange the OneCoin exchange. \u00a0While they like to claim they are similar to Bitcoin this is not true in almost every sense.\u201d \n\n#7: Kidnappers and hardcore criminals\nIt seems terrorists are not the only hardline criminals utilizing Cryptocurrencies for their own ends.\nThe family of billionaire Pearl Oriental Oil chairman Wong Yuk-Kwan were asked to pay his Taiwanese kidnappers ransom in Bitcoin after they threatened to \u201cdig out the eyeballs or chop off the legs\u201d of Yuk-Kwan, The Standard HK reports.\nSouth China Morning Post reports that the kidnappers demanded HK$ 70 million and the wife of Mr. Yuk-Kwan originally ordered to pay the money in mid-october through a Bitcoin account.\n#6: Drug dealing online\nAs the popular saying about Bitcoin goes \"It's only used to buy drugs over the internet!\", it would be an oversight not to mention drugs in this article. Following the closure of the Silk Road and Ross Ulbricht's incarceration, a string of wannabe virtual Scarfaces have cropped up. One such individual, Maximilian S. went by the name Shiny Flakes as he sold around 4 million British Pounds worth of tablets, hashish, and LSD from his mother's flat.\nAlthough, there is no clear consensus regarding the Bitcoin Community\u2019s stance over drugs bought via the cryptocurrency, this man\u2019s sentencing is one of a plethora of reasons where drug use advocates support legalizing drug sales on the deep web in order to protect drug users who maybe then able to access safer and of higher quality \u201cmerchandise\u201d than having to trade with street dealers.\n#5: Dodgy next generation \u201cbanks\u201d\nNextBank's press release might be one of the most fanciful tales ever spun. The company, which claims to be a next-generation bank, offers you the ability to store value in 135 \u00a0currencies, precious metals and, of course, cryptocurrencies. NextBank claims to offer a wide variety of services like international debit cards and escrow service, in reality, it claims that it will offer ALL the services you can think a bank can offer. On top of this, it will also have a help desk in 50 and more languages.\nOn closer investigation however, it turns out that NextBank is only out to scam gullible investors and does not in fact have the infrastructure, staff, or know-how to to deliver on its grandiose promises. Yet another in a long-line of companies that only serve to damage Cryptocurrencies\u2019 reputation.\nJohn Biggs, Techcrunch, in his piece about NextBank concludes,\n \u201cUnfortunately this is a scam. Even if it wasn\u2019t, it would be a piss-poor investment since it fails before it begins and will never exist. It is, however, a good way to make your money not exist.\u201d \nTechcrunch reports having been at the receiving end of legal threats after the coverage went online.\n\n#4: Unlicensed Online Gambling Dens\nGambling has always been in a legal grey area, and online platforms for the activity are no exception.\nBryan Micon, operator of the closed down bitcoin-fueled poker site Seals With Clubs, has been charged by the Nevada Attorney General with operating an unlicensed gambling enterprise, and faces up to ten years in prison and a US$50,000 fine. Interestingly enough it seems he is willing to try an unconventional and as-of-yet untested defense strategy, arguing that Bitcoin is not the same as Currency in the context of gambling law.\nAccording to information available from Nevada\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s website, the investigation into Micon is unique as it is believed to be the first state-level criminal prosecution of an illegal poker website operating with Bitcoin. In a statement released on the Attorney General\u2019s website, AG Burnett, Chairman of the Nevada State Gaming Control Board said that his organisation was \u201cpleased to work\u201d with the office of the Attorney General to stop an interactive gaming website operating without a gaming license.\n#3: Bitcoin high priests who fell hard\nCharlie Shrem was originally charged with a range of offenses including money laundering conspiracy, operating unlicensed money transmitting business and failing to file suspicious activity reports. The case was based off Shrem and his co-defendant, Robert Faiella allegedly attempting to sell over US$1 Mln. in Bitcoin on the Silk Road.\nShrem is well known in the cryptocurrency community. He was CEO of BitInstant, a Bitcoin exchange company, before taking a position with the Bitcoin Foundation, a Bitcoin advocacy and trade group. After being charged for money laundering in the Silk Road scandal however Shrem decided to resign his post with the Bitcoin Foundation.\nIn the end, he opted to take a plea deal, feeling that due to previous rulings in similar cases he was out of luck.\n\u201cI screwed up,\u201d Shrem told U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in his guilty plea according to Bloomberg.", "birthday": "2016-04-04T14:35:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-04 13:35:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 4}

Users ", "content": "[Visit Adzcoin page totry and test it yourself here.]\nIn the undeclared war between online advertisers and Internet users, a new dynamic promises to change everything. ADZcoin suggests a radical approach in terms of web content monetization, using its own brand of cryptocurrency to pay costs to content creators.\nAd blockers and advertisements both have become ubiquitous on the internet. There is hardly any website on the internet today that does not have some form of advertising on it. Ad blockers are thus the favoured tool of Internet users that do not want to be distracted by flashing adverts or even the more annoying self playing YouTube or Facebook videos ads.\nOf Online Advertising and Adblockers\nIn 2015, Page Fair published a global report\u00a0on ad blocking in partnership with Adobe.\nThe report said that as many as 198 million active adblock users exist in the world and in between Q2 2014- Q2 2015, ad blocking grew by an overwhelming 41% globally. Revenue wise ad blocking had a significant impact as the estimated loss of revenue due to such software was pegged at US$ 21.8 billion.\nAd Blocking tech used globally\nThere are a number of ad blocking technologies available today. Some of these function as extensions that can be added to browsers of the user, while others take a different approach. Chrome continues to be a hotbed for ad blocking because of the ease with which extensions can be installed in the browser.\nThere are a number of extensions available for browsers and the most popular among them is Adblock Plus, which has 51% of the global share according to Sourcepoint. Ad block, another ad blocking software has 38% of the market share. Sourcepoint also looked at emerging ad blocking softwares and found that UBlock Origin has grown exponentially in the period between November 2014- August 2015 by a whopping 833%.\nThe War on Ad blockers\nUnfortunately though, not all is rosy for those that choose to use ad blockers. Many websites have decided that they don't want to service content to users who do not watch the adverts of their sponsors. They have a valid point as well because these websites depend on the revenue that they receive from their advertisements.\nWashington Post is one such website that actively tracks users who have ad blockers installed and asks them to sign up for an email newsletter or subscribe if they want to continue receiving their content with their ad blockers on. The Atlantic and Forbes are some of the other big names in journalism that have actively taken measures against users of ad blockers.\nAlthough how effective these measures are or if readers notice them is altogether a different story. We asked Tone Vays - Head of Research at BraveNewCoin, an avid user of Ad Block Plus for the last 5 years and he had this to say, \u201cI have never ran across any website that prevented me from access by having the ad-blocker extension installed.\u201d\nAre Micropayments a solution?\nWhat if there was an incentive for users to allow some advertisements on their screen in return for some direct or indirect monetary benefits? This could be a game changer as it would eliminate the main grouses of content providers as well as consumers. Under this model viewers are either encouraged to pay a small fee for viewing content or content is monetised by other means.\nA novel approach is Brave, which is a new browser by the co-founder of Mozilla, Brendan Eich. This privacy and speed focused browser pays users in Bitcoin to look at non-intrusive advertisements from its own network.\nBrendan Eich, CEO of Brave, on the subject of ad blockers and his own browser centric approach says:\n \u201cBrave blocks ads when its users micropay, so we don\u2019t ask users to choose us instead of an adblocker \u2014 rather, we give users ad revenue share for sites they don\u2019t micropay, and use that to fund payments to their top 10 sites.\u201d \n\nWhy Crypto is the ideal micropayment solution\nCryptocurrencies can be a great enabler and a game changer. The completely digital nature of cryptocurrencies means transactions are a cinch. The low transactional fee is another great incentive for content distributors to choose the crypto route.\nWhile Bitcoin is being used by video content distributors like Popchest as a medium to pay their content creators, there are other cryptocurrencies in vogue as well that can be used for this purpose.\nWe talked with Oleg Khovayako, Emercoin Tech Leader and he told us about EMCLNX, a p2p CPC distributed ads network, which is based on Emercoin. Oleg pitches EMCLNX as a rival to Google Adwords or Bing ads, explaining that \u201cit uses Emercoin as payment currency and payment network, and uses EMC NVS for publishing and distributing ads contracts.\u201d\nTurning content monetization on its head with ADZCoin\nADZcoin is a totally radical approach in terms of web content monetization. ADZcoin uses its own brand of cryptocurrency to pay costs to content creators.\nADZcoin will provide its cryptocurrency to users, who can in turn use the currency to compensate their favourite websites for the content they utilise.\nThe ADZcoin blog explains:\n \u201cSo the simplistic way of making money, which is slapping some ads on a page and driving traffic to that page, is replaced by a \u201cdecentralized quality control system\u201d in which the visitor determines whether or not they think the website creator deserves to earn money or not. This is nothing short of revolutionary and has the power to change the internet as we know it.\u201d \nThe ADZcoin project has developed such a solution that allows publishers to create high-quality content and build a closer bond with their audience, whilst still receiving an income. Readers get content without intrusive ads and do not overpay during online-shopping.\nHow it works?", "birthday": "2016-04-05T14:40:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-05 13:40:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 5}

Undocumented immigration is a global issue, with over 11 million in the United States alone. Many property owners globally have no legal title to their land, and could benefit from land registration. These challenges have traditionally been addressed by governments and NGOs. However, technological innovators and humanitarian activists are pioneering new ways of helping the world's poor through blockchain technology.\nCointelegraph spoke with libertarian journalist Julio Alejandro, founder of the Humanitarian Blockchain, about using blockchain technology to find non-governmental solutions to global humanitarian crises.\nThe first startup to solve global problems using Blockchain technology\nCointelegraph: How would you describe the Humanitarian Blockchain project (in one sentence)?\nJulio Alejandro: The Humanitarian Blockchain (HB) is the first project that solves social global problems using Blockchain technology. I founded it in February 2016 as a start-up at Google Campus London. It aims to become a hub that could match blockchain software developers/IT people with local activists in developing countries to use their technology to solve non-traditional problems, most of them relating to human rights violations, lack of representative democracy, and land registration.\nCT: What are the different elements of the project?\nJA: So we divide it into a project, case-based, system and an administrative, market one. On the first one we have 12 cases in 10 countries. Half of them have achieved their goals or significant milestones and half of them are on going or could be labeled as brainstorming utopia because no one is executing them.\nThey involve registering lands on the blockchain through BitNation in 28 Ashanti Ghanaian communities, providing Bitcoin debit Visa cards to Syrian refugees, creating blockchain IDs to avoid electronic death (which leads to physical disappearance) to journalists, human right defenders, and the political opposition in Colombia, and other projects for sex trafficking in Thailand, incarcerated African-American communities, drug cartel dominated Honduras, and other places in Europe and Africa.\nMost or all of the projects have been carried out by BitNation members, HB is a project that works with and in parallel with Bitnation.\n\n-\u00a0Julio Alejandro, founder of the Humanitarian Blockchain\nA way to make a direct impact on humanitarian and political affairs\nCT: What prompted its creation?\nJA: Good question. Try using any other terms, but in reality, my eternal rage, disappointment, and incapacity to have a direct impact upon humanitarian and political affairs as a journalist.\nCT: That sounds like a good motivation. The best technological advancements come as solutions to problems. Problems make us angry, and that motivates us to do better to our fellow humans. Why use blockchain technology to solve these problems?\nJA: When I was 22 years old I was already the sub-general director (2nd on the list) of a local newspaper La Jornada San Luis. At 25 years old I became one of the world's youngest Foreign Correspondent in Chicago for La Jornada, was promoted a year after to a US National Foreign Correspondent to Excelsior and now, even as one of the top journalistic and most influential/powerful figures in Mexican journalism, our voice, ideas, and messages, are minimal, almost nonexistent. I'm currently the US & UK Foreign Correspondent for one of the top 5 newspapers and media in Mexico in charge of two of the most important countries in the world. I cannot change anything.\nI was introduced to whatever I now know as is Fintech by... Jo\u00ebl Valenzuela, buying beer with Bitcoin at Porcfest.\nCT: Yes, I remember that!\nJA: Before that I always believed in the schemes of internal redistribution through taxation and international reparations to help \u201cdevelopment\u201d and human rights across the globe. As a journalist, they invite me to speak about global and political affairs everywhere. So the first time I went deep, serious, about Fintech was at a university lecture. The whole audience kept asking me about it. So it was the London's elite intellectual audience, whom have never heard of Blockchain/Bitcoin/Ethereum/Smart contracts, etc. that motivated me to do it.\nAny conflicts with governments possible?\nCT: Blockchain tech is very new and cutting-edge, and can be difficult to get professionals to adopt it. It must be even harder to get the world's impoverished to understand. Have you faced any reluctance from the very people you're trying to help, or do you foresee this as a problem?", "birthday": "2016-04-05T16:21:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-05 15:21:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 5}

", "content": "Is it possible to launder billions of USD with Bitcoin?\nFor too long it has been said that cryptocurrencies abet money laundering, corruption, terrorism, and what not due to virtual currencies\u2019 transactions being anonymous and the lack of a central authority watching over the cryptocurrencies.\nWhat are the Panama Papers\nHowever, the leak of the Panama Papers brings to light the issue of transparency in governance and traditional financial transactions, and the role it plays in abetting/curbing global public corruption.\nPanama Papers are the cache of 11.5 million records revealing the hidden financial dealings of hundreds of prominent personalities from all over the world including heads of states, other politicians, businesspersons, sportspersons, and celebrities. The records expose the details of offshore companies controlled by these prominent personalities.\nControlling, or being related to offshore companies is in no ways illegal by itself, however, the records released by the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and the ICIJ (International Consortium of Investigative Journalists) show examples of neglection of laws, tax evasion, corruption, and abuse of political power.\nMossack Fonseca, the shell companies incubator\nThe leaked Panama Papers come from an obscure source, a law firm called Mossack Fonseca.\nMossack Fonseca is a law firm based in the tax haven of Panama. It is the world\u2019s fourth largest law firm to set up offshore companies. It is an obscure and secretive but a very powerful law firm.\nWhat is interesting is that there is no proof to implicate any of Mossack Fonseca\u2019s clients for any wrongdoing, even though as per ICIJ, \u00a0in its list of customers, it has Ponzi schemers, drug kingpins, tax evaders, and at least one jailed sex offender.\nThe law firm also refuses to discuss any case of individual legal misconduct citing client confidentiality as the reason, however it is known to go to great lengths to fortify its customers\u2019 secret blueprints.\nIn fact, as per ICIJ, in Nevada, the firm removed physical records from its Las Vegas office, and had its technical experts remove all e-copies of the records to protect its clients from a legal action by the US District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nGlobal array of crime and corruption\nMossack Fonseca has very shady records. For example, it has worked with at least 33 companies or people that have been blacklisted by the US government due to the evidence of them being involved in extreme legal wrong-doings such as terrorism, drug trafficking, and aiding fascist regimes like North Korea.\nThe firm employs some of the best and controversial names in the public image management industry, thanks to which it has at least been able to manage a low profile if not a positive one.\nHowever, since the last few years, it has been under strict scrutiny by various countries. The law firm was fined by the British Virgin Islands in both 2012 and 2013 for violating anti-laundering laws. In early 2015, German authorities raided its office and private homes in Frankfurt, and in 2016, it is facing investigations for money laundering and bribery in Brazil. These leaks will not do much good to soften the stance of governments towards Mossack Fonseca.\nMoney laundering with Bitcoin can only work for small players\nAll the flake Bitcoin receives for abetting money laundering aside, is it actually possible to launder such huge amounts of money with Bitcoin?\nThe general consensus seem to be, no. There are mainly two areas where it seem to fail: scale of Bitcoin, and pseudo-anonymity.\nBitcoin, as of now, is not large enough to be able to hide large sums of money. Even a small fraction of the amount of money that is allegedly being laundered in the Panama Papers in Bitcoin would cause a significant increase in price of Bitcoin for no one to notice.\nDominik Zynis, founder of a stealth company utilizing blockchain technology, agrees and says that it will probably take Bitcoin another 10-20 years to get to such a scale. Tone Vays, head of research at BraveNewCoin, \u00a0thinks money laundering with Bitcoin can only work for small players.", "birthday": "2016-04-05T18:37:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-05 17:37:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 5}

The uproar has been deafening in some parts of the world, whereas in other parts, you could probably hear a pin drop.\nThe scandal involves the massive leak of data from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca. The data is in the form of 11.5 million confidential documents that have information pertaining to the formation and operation of offshore firms. Let us look at how the Panama Papers have affected the high and mighty in different countries. We also look at the wider impact of this scandal and how cryptocurrency could have lead to a different outcome.\nThe King of Bollywood loses presidential sheen\nPerhaps the most well known Bollywood actor of all time, the undisputed King of Bollywood, Amitabh Bachchan, also known as Bachchan Sr. since his son ventured into the film industry, has become the face of the Mossack Fonseca scandal in India.\nMr. Bachchan\u2019s entire family is in the movie business and his daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, a former Miss World title winner, has also become embroiled in the Panama Paper leaks.\nFor Mr. Bachchan particularly, the Panama Papers could not have sprung out of the woodworks at a worst time, because just a day before the story broke in India, there were discussions in the Indian media about him being nominated as a presidential candidate by the ruling right wing Bharatiya Janata Party.\nThe Indian President is a nominal head of the executive branch, with the real powers resting with the Prime Minister. The Indian Express newspaper, which as a part of 107 media organisations that were provided access by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung investigated the story related to India. They sifted through 11.5 million documents and discovered that more than 500 Indians were mentioned in the papers.\nThe Indian Express also said that 234 Indian Passports were found among the Mossack Fonseca data. Mr. Bachchan issued a denial on April 5, saying, \u201cI have paid all my taxes including on monies spent by me overseas. Monies that I have remitted overseas have been in compliance with law, including remittances through LRS, after paying Indian taxes. In any event, the news report in Indian Express does not even suggest any illegality on my part.\u201d This denial was carried in the Indian Express and other newspapers in India.\n\nMum's the word but Chinese Whispers Persist\nWhile the media in India is having a field day over the Panama Papers, the scene in neighboring China is completely different. After the release of the Mossack Fonseca papers, news arose out of China that Chinese President, Xi Jinping\u2019s, older sister and Li Xiaolin, the daughter of the former premier, Li Peng, figured in the list of people who have offshore companies associated with them. The Chinese state apparatus went into overdrive to silence all news surrounding the event.\nIn a Chinese Foreign Ministry Press Conference held on April 5, the spokesman, Mr. Hong Lei, in response to a reporter\u2019s questioning over the Panama Papers, said \u201cFor these groundless accusations, I have no comment,\u201d as reported by the Atlantic.\nMysteriously though, all reference to these utterances have been removed from the official transcript posted by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on their website. China Digital Times, a website based in Berkeley, California, reports that instructions have been given by one province to the effect, \u201cFind and delete reprinted reports on the Panama Papers. Do not follow up on related content, no exceptions. If material from foreign media attacking China is found on any website, it will be dealt with severely. This directive was delivered orally to on-duty editors. Please act immediately.\u201d\nThe rise of the word Putinphobia\nVladimir Putin is a figure larger than life. When the Mossack Fonseca hit and Mr. Putin\u2019s name figured in it, it came as no surprise that he was the most popular among all those whose names were revealed.\nThe papers reveal that Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle is among the people who stand accused of wrong-doings. The Russian paper Vedomosti reported that a company called Sandalwood was created by Bank Rossii, in which Yuri Kovalchuk has the role of main shareholder. Mr. Kovalchuk has gained a reputation as the \u2018personal banker\u2019 to the Russian President.\nThe good news for Mr. Putin is that he has not yet been named directly as linked to any offshore companies revealed in the papers. The Kremlin has of course seized the moment \u00a0to offer vehement denials, including using the word \u201cPutinphobia\u201d.\nDmitry Peskov, the President\u2019s spokesman said, \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the level of Putinphobia has reached a level at which it is impossible to speak well of Russia, and it\u2019s required to speak ill of Russia\u201d. Unfortunately for Mr. Peskov, the Presidential spokesman, his wife Tatiana Navka, is also a registered beneficiary of an offshore firm called Carina Global Assets Ltd., so he might need to issue some denials on his own behalf as well. \u00a0", "birthday": "2016-04-06T15:20:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-06 14:20:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 6}

", "content": "Dual identity, battle against governments, competition from other cryptocurrencies, scalability among other factors make innovation inevitable if Bitcoin is to survive.\nIn a Vanbex Group report of April 4 2016, Brandon Kostinuk has compared the attempt to describe Bitcoin as a currency or an investment with trying to discern whether light is a particle or a wave. The correct answer of course is, it\u2019s both, he says.\nIn his analysis, Kostinuk points out that Bitcoin faces a multitude of battlefronts that may obstruct it from further pushing into the mainstream, as a universally accepted currency.\nWhether from within, externally, or fundamentally, through design or accident, Bitcoin is up against the real-world pressures of accommodating to wide-spread use. Most notable is the question of scalability, which, if left unsolved, will almost certainly spell disaster for the invention of Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\u2018Developer fund\u2019 could rescue Bitcoin\nPositive news arrived last week with the announcement of a $900,000 Bitcoin Developer Fund for MIT\u2019s Digital Currency Initiative, the institution\u2019s first foray into the Bitcoin and blockchain world.\nThe money, which came from a range of Bitcoin-related (or dependent) companies will help fuel the continued work of Bitcoin Core developer Cory Fields, former Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Gavin Andresen and current Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan. The trio arrived under the wing of MIT last August, a saving grace from the funding constrictions as a result of the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s collapsing profitability.\nMotherboard\u2019s Christopher Malmo has written a good piece on the $900k announcement titled, \u201cTo Survive Long Term, Bitcoin Needs a Break from the Real World.\u201d\nIn his article Malmo comes to the following conclusion:\n \u201cTaking it off the line and into the academic realm could just be the shot in the arm that bitcoin needs to move forward with new ideas. To move forward, it may just need a place to grow without these real-world constraints.\u201d \nBitcoin is fighting on multiple fronts\nKostinuk notes that the problem is that the slew of issues (the battlefronts that Bitcoin is up against) will not suddenly cease, not to mention a key competitor currently surging in popularity coupled with backing from a particular tech giant. The crucial thing, as Van der Laan told CoinDesk in late January, is that \u201cthe time of discussion and planning is over for now and we need to move on with actually realizing the roadmap.\"\nGoing back in time, in Cyprus, in 2013, amid the banking crisis, many Greek citizens looked to Bitcoin as a means of placing their money in a place the government could not reach. Put your feet in the shoes of government then and it\u2019s quite clear why they would be hard pressed to accept an alternate unit of account or exchange as a viable option alongside their own sovereign fiat.\nThe Cyprus episode catapulted the cryptocurrency to new heights, as Guillaume Babin-Tremblay, executive director of the Bitcoin Embassy in Montreal, Que iterated. He said to Kitco News that \u201cBitcoins were growing slowly until Cyprus. Cyprus was the catalyst for the big increase in the price.\u201d\nThe price sat at $40 per Bitcoin and then doubled within a couple of days, according to Babin-Tremblay, with Kitco News reporting, \u201cPrices pushed towards $200, but dropped to about $60 after the banking crisis abated.\u201d Bitcoin offered Cypriots, who were at risk of having assets seized by the Central Bank of Cyprus, a place to put their money outside the reach of governments.\nChina, Argentina, Iceland and Russia, with their slumping economy the target of international sanctions and duly battered by the collapse in commodity prices, are all home to economies that have fomented a need for investors to seek an alternative vehicle of investment. Right or wrong, this action, moving currency out of the domestic system, affects economic stability. Growth is also hindered when citizens move funds offshore for the obvious reasons that that money no longer feeds the national economy through taxation, consumer spending or on-hand capital for banks.\nThis is what investment in Bitcoin is tantamount to and, hence, the opposition to the cryptocurrency and the ensuing legislative battles. The above example is also demonstrative of how and why a digital currency gains value and can experience intense volatility. It\u2019s quite circular in nature.\nBitcoin thrives as an investment\nOn one hand, it\u2019s about demand, which in turn feeds the purchasing power of a currency. On the other hand, demand for investment in a particular currency oftentimes has to do with its purchasing power or value on the world market, otherwise, why invest?", "birthday": "2016-04-06T13:20:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-06 12:20:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 6}

Will this lead to more private conversations or have they just opened a can of worms?\nOn April 5, 2016, WhatsApp announced on its blog that they were going to start providing full end-to-end encryption.\nThe announcement says:\n \u201cThe idea is simple: when you send a message, the only person who can read it is the person or group chat that you send that message to. No one can see inside that message. Not cybercriminals. Not hackers. Not oppressive regimes. Not even us. End-to-end encryption helps make communication via WhatsApp private \u2013 sort of like a face-to-face conversation.\u201d \nWhat is encryption and how will it work for WhatsApp users?\nWhatsApp claims that privacy and security is in their DNA. The \u00a0Mountain View, California-based company has offered a detailed technical explanation of how they plan to offer end-to-end encryption in a technical whitepaper.\nIt may be of interest to many of you that WhatsApp uses broadly the same HMAC-SHA256 technology for authentication that Bitcoin also utilises. For exchanging messages, WhatsApp uses AES256 in CBC mode and the message key changes each time a message is sent and is transient.\nWhatsApp will encrypt files and voice calls along with text messages as well that are sent over its network. Everyone who has the latest version of WhatsApp will be able to use this feature, and there is no option of turning encryption off and there is no need to initiate encryption by starting a private chat either.\nNew encryption enabled WhatsApp users get a message saying, \u201cMessages you send to this chat and calls are now secured with end-to-end encryption. Tap for more info.\u201d Users can then tap on more info to get to a page that has a QR code which can be scanned on your contact\u2019s phone to verify the end-to-end encryption.\nIn case the QR codes match a green tick should appear. In case of a mismatch an exclamation mark in red will appear warning users that the chat is not encrypted. Users can also manually verify a series of numbers printed on this screen manually.\nDoes this really matter?\nPrivacy and security are a matter of great importance for many people, while others take a more relaxed attitude towards them.

Aspiring to tame the digital transformation process which brings new challenges along with new opportunities, our primary goal is to develop and introduce new approaches to utilize this process to the \u00a0maximum.\nBlockchain technology: Bringing the world of finance into the modern world\nSometimes, it\u2019s not only about the technology itself, but also about the navigating the changing digital landscape.\nTo succeed in the process of digital transformation, partners are called on to build a trusted and collaborative network. This especially concerns highly regulated industries with big money and sensitive information at stake.\nThe way the software behind Bitcoin verifies and logs transactions is one of the key aspects that sparked interest in the use of blockchains by banking and financial institutions.\nEvery transaction is recorded in a public ledger, which is maintained by a network of computers around the world. Transactions are then verified by a cryptographic software ensuring the integrity and sustainability of history records.\nWhat is there for banking and financial institutions?\nBanks want their blockchains to store not only transaction history of cryptocurrency, but other kinds of records, including transactions in conventional financial assets, such as currencies, bonds, or derivatives.\nBesides, banks are seeking to explore the concept of \u201csmart contracts\u201d, in which updates to a blockchain can be added by simple computer programs, which for instance make possible to automatically payout when a particular transaction occurs.\nBanks also want to be sure that all data is stored safely, and the whole system is characterized by the highest level of reliability and privacy. \u00a0Instead of relying on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain, which is public and maintained by a community of strangers, banks are interested and motivated to develop and run a software to contribute to system\u2019s maintenance and upkeep.\nIntroducing Corda\nWhile exploring the possibilities of blockchain technologies in financial sectors engineers at R3 have developed a distributed ledger, which can even be considered an alternative to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain and is especially tailored for financial and banking institutions.\nWhile it is largely inspired by the captures and benefits of blockchain systems, it includes design choices that make it more appropriate for executing financial scenarios. Unlike blockchain design, the starting point for development of Corda is making individual agreements between firms, implying that not all information is distributed among participants, but only the part they decide necessary to share.\nDevelopers of Corda focus on the reality of managing financial agreements and intend to make it easier to write business logic and integrate it with existing codes, ensuring the support of choreography between firms as they build up their agreements.\nPartnership with Microsoft\nSeeing Corda as a powerful tool, developers acknowledge that it may be less well suited for others. That is why the company constantly engages with partners who are working on complementary platforms in this space.\nPursuing similar goals in building next-generation technologies, R3 has recently built a partnership with Microsoft. \u00a0Before approaching Microsoft the company explored using other platforms, including IBM Cloud and Amazon AWS. However, R3 decided that Microsoft\u2019s capabilities best suited the company\u2019s needs in serving its financial institution members.\nPeggy Johnson, Executive Vice President, Business Development, says:\n \u201cWe\u2019re proud that organizations like R3 trust Microsoft as a partner to build the financial technology systems of the future; we\u2019re committed to continue earning the trust of business leaders and their customers around the world.\u201d \n\nMicrosoft has a long history of working with financial institutions to build software solutions, and is now developing blockchain as a service. Microsoft\u2019s initial step into the adaptation of blockchain technologies was last year with an offering on the Ethereum Platform with ConsenSys, which resulted in the packaged Azure Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) offerings in the Azure marketplace. Later, Microsoft collaborated with Ripple, a cryptographic ledger software vendor, and a group of 11 banks including UBS and Credit Suisse around development of blockchain technology.\nMore recently, Microsoft released a preview of a special lab environment in Azure\u2019s DevTest Labs to allow blockchain-related services and partners to decouple the technology from virtual machines.", "birthday": "2016-04-08T15:38:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-08 14:38:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 8}

However, before considering it as a method of receiving your wage, it won\u2019t hurt to ask for some advice. For example, do you know how to arrange conversion of cryptocurrency to fiat currency? What are the advantages, disadvantages and pitfalls of being paid in cryptocurrency? And finally, what kinds of jobs are paid this way?\nNiel De La Rouviere, one of the first people to be paid in Bitcoin, said to Fast Company:\n \u201cI discovered bitcoin in early 2011. At first it was something that felt like play money and almost surreal. I didn\u2019t fully understand all the details back then, but a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency was just too crazy and I became intrigued.\u201d \nHigh wages, nice bonuses and no paperwork\nFirst of all, you can benefit from the exchange rate: If you do not immediately convert your Bitcoin to fiat currency and instead wait for a more beneficial exchange rate, you may get a nice bonus to your wage (in fiat money) depending on your trading abilities and your patience.\nSecondly, you don\u2019t need to do any paperwork - this is especially important for freelancers, moonlighters and those who strongly hate bureaucracy. Nobody will ask you about the source of sum equivalent to $10,000 credited to your Bitcoin wallet, and the wallet itself will not show you a message saying that limits were exceeded and now you have to go through verification/authorization procedure, send a pack of notarized documents or visit your bank. However, this is true only until you decide to convert your \u201ccoins\u201d to cash.\nThirdly, the wages are higher than average on the market. If an employer can only offer this exotic payment method, feel free to ask for more money due to the inconvenience of this payment method. Besides, payment in Bitcoin is often related to jobs which require specific knowledge of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin startups, exchanges, etc.) Such knowledge is sought after, and if you have it, you can be paid more than the average market wage for your profession.\nIn addition to this, if you save some bitcoins, it can turn into a long-term investment. Some experts predict that the Bitcoin exchange rate can be as high as $10,000, and so, if you save up a part of your earned Bitcoins, you will substantially increase your capital.\nLast but not least - it is exciting and interesting. If you find a job in a crypto-startup, you can learn a lot and develop your skills in a new field that you have never experienced before.\nJeremy Allaire, Circle CEO, explains to CNN Money:", "birthday": "2016-04-09T11:45:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-09 10:45:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 9}

A Blockchain is at its core a ledger of records, which is distributed across different parties. It can only be updated with the consensus of the majority of the participants it is shared with and is inerasable. \u00a0\nThe beauty of the Blockchain is that its applications go beyond cryptocurrency transactions. 2015 saw a lot of hype around Blockchain and its adoption by the mainstream financial services industry.\nWe talked with some industry experts and took their view on the evolution of the FinTech sector and integration of Blockchain as a tool in the hands of the financial sector. With the help of these experts we have compiled together some upcoming trends in Blockchain tech for 2016.\nSmart Contracts are here to stay\nWith the advent of Ethereum, there will be growing buzz in 2016 around smart contracts. Smart contracts are basically the digital equivalent of their paper peers.\nEthereum is particularly interesting in this context because the Ethereum Blockchain can contain smart contracts as account holding objects, which contain certain code functions and can interact with other existing contracts, store data or even send Ether to others. Large tech companies such as Microsoft are excited by the possibilities that this technology has opened up.\nMarley Gray, Director BizDev & Strategy for Cloud + Enterprise: Blockchain at Microsoft, writes in his\u00a0blog:\n \u201cIn Financial Services particularly, Blockchain is a major disruptor to some of their core businesses, and FinTech companies are driving innovation in this space.\u00a0 Ethereum is open, flexible can be customized to meet our customer\u2019s needs allowing them to innovate and provide new services and distributed applications or \u0110apps. Ethereum enables Smart Contracts and Distributed Applications (\u0110Apps) to be built, potentially cutting out the middleman in many industry scenarios streamlining processes like settlement. But that is just scratching the surface of what can be done when you mix the cryptographic security and reliability of the Blockchain with a Turing complete programming language included in Ethereum, we can\u2019t really imagine what our customers and partners will build.\u201d \nFocus will be on Blockchain integration\nBanks and other financial institutions may benefit from the transparency, security and other benefits that Blockchain technology has to offer but there will be a significant amount of integration required to make it all work. This means Blockchain needs to fit in with other banking systems such as Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML) etc. There is already a buzz in this space.\nFran Strajnar, Co-Founder & CEO of Techemy Ltd, parent company of BraveNewCoin.com and Techemy.co, says:\n \u201cOver $1b USD worth of investment would state that it is possible to integrate Blockchains into a variety of Financial Services solutions. We will see 5-10 'Blockchains' that matter (which get adopted) in 5 years time. Meanwhile there is dozens of Blockchain designs competing for various FinTech verticals.\u201d \n\n2016 will see titling and voting based Blockchain applications\nUnique and innovative solutions from land titling to voting would go digital with the help of Blockchain technology. This is likely to put more non-technical people on the street in touch with Blockchain tech than ever before. In fact for many people, these are the uses of Blockchain that would allow them to trust the system and perhaps even explore cryptocurrencies; once they see the value in Blockchain based systems.\nValery Vavilov, CEO and founder of Bitfury Group, a leading fully integrated Bitcoin Blockchain infrastructure provider and transaction processing company, explains:\n \u201cThe Blockchain is the most transformational technology since the Internet and the possibilities for its overall growth and impact are substantial and immeasurable at this early stage in its creation and evolution.\u201d \nCompanies such as the BitFury Group are engaged in securing transactions of assets on the blockchain. They have the ability to secure and easily provide accessibility to assets enabling easier transactions. The ability of modern blockchain leaders to provide such services as well as enable transactions such as titling and voting etc can open doors to many.\n2016 will be about Hit and Trial\nAll new technologies have teething troubles, and the integration of Blockchain into the FinTech system would be no different. In fact it could be argued that failure is the necessary ingredient to success in the long-term. Problems of scalability and faulty system integration architecture maybe initial stumbling blocks.\nAccording to Marley Gray of Microsoft, there is scope for experimentation as he describes in his blog. Mr. Gray says that \u201cEthereum Blockchain as a Service\u201d provided by Microsoft Azure can allow financial services customers and partners to toy with, experience and even fail quickly at relatively lower costs in a readymade developer/test/production environment.

Bitcoin casinos are taking advantage of this same phenomenon to grow exponentially.\nBitcoin is decentralized, mostly anonymous, and is not subject to variance in rules and regulations that traditional currency around the world is. For these reasons, it has become a popular way for people from around the globe to engage in gambling entertainment. It makes sense due to the cultural and religious stigma that is often associated with gambling. Making the trip to a brick and mortar casino or gaming on a traditional currency based online casino can be a hassle.\nBitcoin allows for anonymous deposits and withdraws in a near instant fashion, making bitcoin gambling virtually anonymous. Further, bitcoin casino players can engage in their favorite games of chance or skill whenever they choose from the comfort of their own home. Hotels, transportation, and eating out costs are all eliminated. \u00a0\nSports Betting is also Experiencing Massive Growth\nSports betting is another form of bitcoin gambling entertainment that has expanded at a frenetic rate, with vast potential to continue to grow. March Madness, the nickname for the tournament that decides the collegiate basketball championship in the United States, is expecting to take in more than 9 billion dollars\u2019 worth of bets this year. Clearly the thirst for action from consumers is there and growing every single year. There are a large number of sports books who currently accept bitcoin deposits and bets.\nSports and outcome betting junkies will also be excited to learn about bitcoin betting exchanges. Unlike traditional sports betting, where the house places the odds and the players can choose to either take those odds or not place a bet, bitcoin betting exchanges offer players a chance to play both sides.\nThe betting exchanges work by supplying a venue for the action of players, who are able to place odds themselves or accept the odds of another player. Players bet against each other, the bitcoin betting exchange is simply a facilitator of the action. With this new freedom in action, players can either be the layer of odds or the backer of the bet. Both layers and backers can choose the odds they prefer, or create their own and allow other players to accept them if they wish.\nWhat makes this unique is bettors of both sides are able to place bets at odds they feel are most advantageous to them. This is not the only reason bitcoin betting exchanges should be on the radar of event occurrence betting enthusiasts, they will also save you a bundle on fees. Since bitcoin betting exchanges are not active participants in the bet, the fees associated with wagering there are dramatically lower than traditional sports books.\nInstead of the industry standard 5%-16%, bitcoin betting exchanges offer rates of around 2%. This is a huge equity gain for large and small players alike, giving everyone a better opportunity to be successful. If you have not yet looked into bitcoin betting exchanges, but enjoy the action of outcome based and sports wagering, now is definitely the time to do so.\nFantasy sports betting is experiencing a prolonged growth spurt, becoming a multi-billion dollar industry in just a few short years. Just like with poker 5 years ago, state and federal regulators are cracking down with the exposure exponential growth has given fantasy sports betting. Many are frustrated with government involvement, suspecting it has more to do with the desire of traditional gambling outlets to protect their business than with the concern for customer safety. \u00a0", "birthday": "2016-04-02T14:30:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-02 13:30:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 2}

", "content": "Cointelegraph investigates the pros and cons of storing one\u2019s assets in Bitcoin versus storing them via traditional methods such as gold bullion, and speaks to a number of cryptocurrency experts to hear their view.\nInherent value\nOne of the biggest arguments against the cryptocurrency is that it has no inherent value, and as such cannot be considered a safe investment, as if people stop perceiving it as having value, your assets are lost, as it is not backed by anything in the same way that paper money is backed by state gold reserves.\nAs Dominik \u017bynis, President & CTO of Stealth Company, put it:\n \u201cGold is a store of value that goes back many thousands of years, while bitcoin is relatively new and still out to prove itself. Actually bitcoin is more like a specific kind of coin, whereas p2p consensus blockchains are more like gold the metal. What I am saying is bitcoin might be lead (the metal).\u201d \nHowever, Patrick Dugan, CIO of Crypto Currency Concepts, suggests a different model: \u201cI would argue that bitcoin the asset is like gold, and p2p cryptographic consensus is like physics. Gold's proof-of-work is all them supernovas what forged it!\u201d\nSafe assets\nFirstly, it's important for one to decide what they\u2019re looking for in a means of asset storage. Do they want a stable rate of return, very low price volatility and by the same token, price stability, or very high returns that come with an increased chance of loss?\nRight now, if you\u2019re looking for the first two, gold bullion or other precious metal storage is probably your best bet, with Bitcoin being the most favourable for the latter function. However, many in the Bitcoin community foresee Bitcoin becoming something of a \u2018virtual gold\u2019 as the price stabilises and becomes a solid means of stable asset storage.\nDavid Andolfatto of VP Fed Bank of St-Louis sees Bitcoin becoming the next safe asset, saying: \u201cIs Bitcoin a safe asset? You're probably thinking no, of course not. The dollar price of bitcoin can be quite volatile. One can easily gain or lose 50% over a very short period of time. So if we're talking about an asset that offers a stable rate of return, Bitcoin ain't it.\u201d\nHowever, he further elaborates:\n \u201cExcept that this is not what I mean by a safe asset. I'm not even sure how to precisely define what I mean by safe asset. Loosely speaking, I'm thinking about an asset that people flock to in bad or uncertain economic times. In normal times, it's an asset that is held despite having a relatively low rate of return, perhaps because of its use as a hedge, or because of its liquidity properties\u2026 I think that Bitcoin could be the world's next great safe asset. At least, it certainly seems to have all the properties that are desired in a safe asset.\u201d \nThe properties he is referencing include:\n Bitcoin constitute no legal claim against anything of intrinsic value, it is simply a record-keeping technology, meaning it is not pegged to any other monetary instrument\u2019s value. It pays no interest, so can be stored for extensive periods of time. Possession corresponds to ownership, so confiscation by regulatory bodies is less of a risk. The ledger has proven itself secure, so Bitcoin is not at risk from traditional theft in the same way that gold and other precious metal bullion is. The money supply is fixed at 21 million BTC, so it will not devalue over time. \nHe concludes by saying that even if Bitcoin is not a particularly ideal monetary instrument, this does not preclude it from serving as a safe asset or longer-term store of value. Once market penetration is complete, its return behavior is likely to mimic the return behavior of any other safe asset. Safe assets generally earn a low expected return (that is, they are priced dearly).\nAddressing to the investors, David Andolfatto says:\n \u201cInvestors can expect to earn unusually high returns in a crisis event. But if you buy at the top, you can expect to realize unusually high losses when the crisis subsides. In short, it's a great investment -- assuming you can predict when a crisis will occur and when it will end!\u201d \nHigh risk, high return\nFor those looking for an investment that is high risk, but high return, many would argue that Bitcoin is their best bet. As Rik Willard, CEO of MintCombine, suggests, if you want high returns on gold, it \u201cneeds to stay in the ground...to spur value,\u201d something many miners, especially those looking to turn a quick profit in the business of illegal mining, are not prepared to do.\nAlso on the topic of illegal gold mining, another reason for choosing Bitcoin over the traditional gold bullion is that you can be comfortable with the knowledge that your assets are not being stored in a means thats origin was potentially morally reprehensible.\nThis comes as a new study has shown that water and food sources for 19 Indigenous Yanomami and Yekuana communities in the Brazilian Amazon contain dangerously high quantities of mercury as a result of illegal mining, which has led to researchers finding that 90% of people in these communities had been severely affected by mercury poisoning.\nDigital gold\nTone Vays of LibertyLifeTrail.com would argue that Bitcoin truly is \"Digital Gold\" but because it's so new there is significantly more price volatility risk which is a trade off vs. a much larger potential future valuation. While gold has been a store of value for thousands of year, gold does not adjust for technological innovation to improve standards of living and that is why the stock market has always outperformed gold in any 30-year time period.\nAnother big problem with gold is that it has a huge political risk as authorities can confiscate it from any vault and as Gold Money recently found out, there is too much regulation preventing the creation of a gold-based payment system.\nTone Vays explains to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cGold is also no longer useful as a safe haven to transfer value cross-borders due to the invention of metal detectors and scanners. Both bitcoins and gold are difficult to protect when they are in your passion, but given the technological advancement, Bitcoin should start to become the obvious choice over the next 10 years as the better protective asset.\u201d ", "birthday": "2016-04-02T16:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-02 15:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 2}

Is it a good time to start mining again?\nIn the old days, gold needed to be dug out of the earth which required a lot of effort. Things have not changed much since then, someone still needs to make an effort to create \u2018wealth\u2019.\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrencies, they need to be mined as well. This mining is computational and is done by specialised computers that solve very specific math problems. In the case of Bitcoin, only a finite number of them will ever exist \u2013 21 million. So it is possible to solve these math problems, and receive Bitcoin in return till this number is reached.\nOf course, there is always a catch, and the catch with mining is that the machines used to mine cryptocurrencies require a lot of electricity, and that is an expensive commodity.\nWhat makes Mining Profitable\nMining profitability is a variable and depends largely on the type of mining software you own, the cost of electricity in your locale, the current price of the cryptocurrency you are mining and, of course, your own overheads.\nWe looked at some mining equipment on the market and compared how they stacked against each other in terms of price, performance and potential profitability.\n\n*Source:BitCoinWiki and www.bitcoinx.com/bitcoin-mining-hardware/\n Mhash/s = millions hashes per second \u00a0 Mhash/J = millions hashes per joule \nAs is apparent from the table, there is mining hardware available for every level and budget. You could be a hobbyist or a full scale bitcoin farm owner and there is something available for you. It is however, important to consider parameters such as power consumption, price of equipment and hashrate before making a purchase.\nChinese companies control over 65% of Bitcoins mined\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are designed to be difficult to mine with the passage of time as more and more units are mined. With increasing difficulty in mining and the need for better hardware, a lot of people can come together to mine. This collection of people is known as a mining pool.\nA share is awarded to members of a pool who can show \u2018valid proof of work\u2019. Miners have a choice of many different mining pools. Usually, joining a smaller pool is the preferred approach so as to avoid concentration of hashing power.\nMiners can use various approaches to mining:\n The Pay-per-Share (PPS) approach lets you get a fixed payout for each share that you solve. The payment is instant and is made from the existing resources. Total payouts using PPS are non-variable. Pay Per Last N Shares (PPLNS) approach adds an element of \u2018luck\u2019, which fluctuates between 5-30% on top of the payout you would have received had you used PPS. Slush approach, or Bitcoin Pooled Mining (BPM), is score-based. Older shares, receive lower weight than most recent shares. This has the advantage of reducing the chances of cheating in a round of mining. P2Pool, Eligius, Geometric and Double Geometric approaches are based on other existing approaches and are refinements. \nWe decided to examin Bitcoin mining trends in 2016. According to hashrate distribution data released by Blockchain.info over the past 4 days starting March 29, 2016, the table below shows some popular bitcoin mining pools and their market share.\n        \nAs of the end of March 2016, these 3 Chinese companies control over 65% of Bitcoins mined. Ant Pool is owned by Bitmain Technologies Ltd which is headquartered in Beijing, China. F2Pool and BTCC also have their roots in China.\nCloud mining comes of age\nCloud mining is a relatively new concept and miners have far more choices in 2016 than ever before from \u00a0among various cloud mining companies.\nEdgar Bers, Customer Relations Manager at Hashflare.io, on the emergence of cloud mining says:\n \"Cloud mining is a relatively new thing but we see that more and more people are getting interested in such service. I believe that this service has a very high impact on current bitcoin community as it allows something which was previously only available to technologically easygoing people. The more people can get involved in cryptocurrency world, the higher are the chances that this will not be something to come and go, but something to stay for a long time. I think any bitcoin enthusiast would like to live up to the day when you can use cryptocurrencies in Walmart, LIDL or Rimi.\" \nCloud mining is basically a service that will allow you to pay for hashing power, which is hosted in data centres and sold in Gigahash/seconds (GH/s). Many cloud mining plans are available online but it is important to choose a reliable provider.\nAlex Gromov, Media Buyer at Hashflare.io has this to say:\n \u201cWhen you compare cloud and private mining you will see that cloud mining has its unbeatable benefits, such as no power limitation. You would probably not get more than 6 kWt at your living place, while having a semi-professional \u201cfarm\u201d is pretty risky due to high fire- and overall security reasons. In our case we use specialized datacenters which are equipped with everything necessary for convenient and risk-free mining.\u201d \nCloud mining services to look into in 2016\nWe looked at some popular cloud mining companies and their offerings in 2016, the cost barrier to cloud mine is relatively cheap and users can start mining immediately. There are a number of cloud mining companies offering services. Genesis Mining was the world\u2019s first large scale multi-algorithm based cloud mining service, which provides both bitcoin and altcoin mining solutions. Cldmine.com offers cloud mining services in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.", "birthday": "2016-03-30T16:54:00+01:00", "date": "2016-03-30 15:54:00", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 30}

This time, it comes attached with punitive damages that could range from million ruble fines to up to seven years in jail and the ceasing of business operations.\nIt is a bill before the legislative\nContained in this report, the road with Bitcoin and Russia has been a rocky one for years, stretching back to January 2014 when the Bank of Russia first declared digital currencies as risky, speculative and not legally bound monies. In the same year, discussion of bans and imposement of fines were raised but nothing ever materialized into law.\nRussia then took an ambiguous stance against the cryptocurrency last fall, as was reported by Coindesk. It was then unveiled Russia\u2019s central bank did not support the outright banning of Bitcoin, a position that was duly backed by President Vladimir Putin.\nNevertheless, 2016 delivers another push by the Russian finance ministry toward halting Bitcoin-based monetary activity altogether, especially exchange related operations within the country\u2019s borders.\nAlexey Moiseev, Russia\u2019s deputy minister of finance, as quoted in RIA Novosti, says:\n \u201cI hope we will manage to do this in a reasonably short period of time. I believe, we will be able to bring it in before the end of the spring session, but I don\u2019t know if it will be passed in a first reading.\u201d \nCurrently, Bitcoin is not banned in the country, but it is not legal currency either.

Bolivia, Ecuador, Iceland, Kyrgyzstan and Vietnam are other countries that also have some level of ban in place for bitcoin, with China leaning in a similar direction, even going so far as to attempt to usurp the qualities and characteristics presented in bitcoin for its own centrally issued currency.\nMany will recall that in December 2013, the People's Bank of China and five other related government ministries released an official notice titled, Guarding Against the Risks of Bitcoin, which essentially stated bitcoin may not be used as currency in the country.\nThe interesting aspect regarding China and Bitcoin is that Chinese miners control at least half of the cryptocurrency mining network, concentrating a lot of power over the cryptocurrency core transactional function. The national control over an entity valued at over USD $6.5 billion in market capitalization would presuppose a desire to maintain and develop that source.

That\u2019s how it works: ransomware encrypts files, and you can no longer access your data. Then it demands payment for decrypting your files. The payment is often accepted in bitcoin.\nCryptoWall is a family of popular file-encrypting viruses, that has been around for less than 5 months and has already extorted more than $1 million and inflicted inestimable damage on users who refuse to pay ransom. Bitdefender has come up with \u201cCryptoWall Immunizer\u201d and offers it as a free download from the Bitdefender Labs product page.\nC\u0103t\u0103lin Co\u0219oi says:", "birthday": "2016-04-01T09:30:00+01:00", "date": "2016-04-01 08:30:00", "year": 2016, "month": 4, "day": 1}

It hopes to launch its prepaid plastic and digital gift cards programme soon.\nMaking it easier to acquire Bitcoin\nCo-founder and CEO of Bitit, Nicolas Katan, says, despite recent worries about Bitcoin, he is still a firm believer in the cryptocurrency. It allows consumers to avoid banks and credit cards, and the hefty transaction fees that come with them. And that is revolutionary, and vital as this in turn allows consumers to have greater controls over their own money.\nHowever, he recognises that Bitcoin itself does have its own issues. Bitit hopes to solve two of the biggest, accessibility and fraud, which he says will make it easier than ever for average consumers to acquire the cryptocurrency. This is due in part to the fact that the fundamental system underpinning Bitcoin, the Blockchain, can seem incredibly complicated to those who are not technologically inclined, so they end up avoiding it.\nNicolas Katan, Co-founder and CEO of Bitit, says:\n \u201cWe have a vision to democratize Bitcoin for all. Bitcoin is a really great technology. But the problem for now is that it is complicated and difficult for people to access.\u201d \nPreventing fraud\nThe other issue Katan believes faces Bitcoin is fraud; because of Bitcoin\u2019s reported anonymity and low transaction fees, those wishing to launder money see it as a very useful option. This has led to high rates of fraud among in-person Bitcoin retailers, which in turn has meant retailers charge inordinate fees of up to 20% in an attempt to curb its nefarious usage.\nBitit tackles this issue without high fees by offering a system whereby people can buy up to $25 in BTC without any paperwork, but after that, they must submit a series of identity verification documents, to buy BTC up to a limit of $500.\nKatan adds:\n \u201cOur value creation is how we manage the risk. When you say Bitcoin and credit card, you think: fraud.\u201d \nHow it works\nBitit has partnered with French company, Neosurf, which produces vouchers that allow you to use cash to buy a one-time use paper gift card, about the size of a receipt. These can then be redeemed for online purchases. In this case, they are used for redeeming Bitcoin. The system is very much similar to that of Flexepin in North America. These paper gift cards are available in all of Bitit\u2019s new 100,000 locations.", "birthday": "2016-03-31T09:00:00+01:00", "date": "2016-03-31 08:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 31}

Wintris Inc., a British Virgin Islands-based company revealed to be owned by Anna Sigurlaug P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir, wife of Prime Minister Sigmundur Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Gunnlaugsson, is claiming 515 mln. isk (icelandic kronas, over 4 million USD) in bankruptcy funds from the three failed banks during the crash. Seeing this as a corrupt move, opposition parties are reportedly moving towards a no confidence vote in the Prime Minister, and a petition calling for his resignation has acquired more than 12,000 votes.\nThe 2008 banking collapse created fertile ground for crypto\nAuroracoin, a cryptocurrency made for the Icelandic people, generated a great deal of interest when plans were announced to distribute it directly to the people themselves. The distribution was carried out without a proper infrastructure in place for conversion into local currency, resulting in a steep price drop as citizens attempted to sell off their coins. Amid new problems stemming from corruption in Iceland\u2019s government, a renewed Auroracoin push is planned by the development team this year.\nCointelegraph spoke with P\u00e9tur \u00c1rnason, Chairman of the Aurar\u00e1\u00f0 foundation, and Hlynur \u00de\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rnsson, a Foundation board member, about Auroracoin\u2019s second coming.\nCointelegraph: What prompted the creation of the Auroracoin project?\nP\u00e9tur \u00c1rnason: I can\u2019t answer for the original developers since they were anonymous and none of the current developers was involved with that. The Auroracoin project is an experiment to jump start an cryptocurrency economy. The idea was to distribute cryptocurrency to a whole nation where everyone had an equal chance to claim the coins and take part in the experiment. What better way to get a cryptocurrency economy going.\nHlynur \u00de\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rnsson: The fundamentals and the reason for Auroracoin are still the same. There are currency controls in Iceland after the banking collapse in 2008, history of endless devaluation of the local currency, the Icelandic krona, and decades of inflation.\nPA: Iceland is the perfect place to conduct such an experiment. The country is closed behind capital controls which means that its citizens are not allowed to buy foreign currency. Iceland has the highest internet usage in the world and are technically inclined and we experienced a full blown bank collapse in 2008 making the people of Iceland more aware of the dangers that we face with the banks and the current monetary system. Most importantly is the size of Iceland\u2019s population. There are only 330.000 people living in Iceland. Contrary to most other altcoins who are trying to conquer the world, Auroracoin has a clear and reasonable goal.\nHB: The 2008 banking collapse created fertile ground for crypto. The bad part of the perfect storm is that the people here can't buy Bitcoin due to the currency controls.\nAuroracoin\u2019s \u201cairdrop\u201d to the people of Iceland\nCT: What was the distribution plan for Auroracoin?\nPA: Auroracoin was distributed via an so called airdrop where all Icelandic citizens were given the equal chance to claim their fair share of Auroracoins. Half of the total coin supply was to be distributed in three phases. For the first phase all the coins that were reserved were divided by the total number of Icelandic citizens which resulted in each person being able to claim 31.8 AUR. For the second phase of the airdrop the airdrop was reset the amount was increased to 318 coins. Same was done for the third and final phase except the amount was doubled and went to 636. Then when the airdrop was finished the remaining coins were to be burned.\nCT: Meaning, the remaining 50% were destroyed?\nPA: Yes the remainder of the 50% that was reserved for the airdrop were burned.\nHB: After the creator of the coin (Baldur) finished the distribution and burned the remaining coins he left the development up to the community, which is where we come into the picture.\nPA: This was the last task of the original developers which were known by the name Baldur Friggjar \u00d3\u00f0insson. They have not been heard from since.\nCT: So their idea was to gift Auroracoin to the world and then disappear, much like Satoshi did with Bitcoin?\nHB: More or less.\nPA: Yes seems like that was the idea. Baldur had stated that from the beginning, so it was not like it was a surprise to anyone when Baldur stopped communications.\n\nPost-airdrop price collapse\nHB: During the airdrop a price drop for Auroracoin was expected, when the airdropped coins came to the market. Since there was no exchange operating in Iceland where people could buy the coins others wanted to sell it was a one way market only sellers and no buyers. It is estimated that 10% of the airdropped coins ended on foreign crypto exchanges and were traded for Bitcoin. Icelanders interested in the project were unable to buy those coins because of the currency controls. Now this is about to change. An Icelandic exchange (ISX) is opening in Iceland that will trade Auroracoin / Icelandic krona. This will be the second birth for Auroracoin and give Icelanders a chance to buy and sell the coin without the currency controls being in the way. We hope this will lead to new price discovery for the coin and jumpstart an economy around the coin in Iceland.\nCT: Because of this initial lack of exchange, would it be fair to say that the initial rollout didn't go as expected?\nHB: True.\nPA: Well it was a factor. There were few factors in fact. One would be the hype and price explosion that happened before the airdrop. This created a situation where the coin was hugely overvalued and had nowhere to go but down fast and hard. The attention became too much about the price.\nHB: Also other infrastructure such as mobile wallets were missing, and payment solutions for merchants were also missing.\nPA: Another factor was the fact that an the developers were unknown and holding enormous funds in their hands. This created some uncertainty and distrust. Then you have the absence of an exchange. An exchange is an essential part if you want to jump start an cryptocurrency economy. To begin with, merchants and others willing to accept a cryptocurrency need to have the option to convert the cryptocurrency back into fiat as they need that to purchase their stock, pay bills and salaries. As the economy evolves the merchant should have less and less incentive to trade the crypto back to fiat as he would start to be able to use it for his expenses.\nCT: And this infrastructure was lacking in Iceland at the time, correct?\nPA: Yes. There wasn\u2019t much of an infrastructure in place at all when the airdrop started, and that is the main reason the current developer group has been close to silent in the past year. We wanted to avoid all hype and take the time to secure the coin as best we could and create the missing infrastructure before we would raise the sails again.\nAuroracoin\u2019s great renaissance\nCT: So you've been preparing behind the scenes for a great Auroracoin renaissance?\nPA: Yes we have been working hard for the past year to prepare the structure that needs to be in place for Auroracoin to be adopted here in Iceland. We have done our best to secure the coin, we are working on merchant tools, wider range of wallets and most importantly creating a secure and easy to use exchange where the Icelandic public can trade ISK and AUR. We have also cleared up all legal views regarding usage and trade of Auroracoin in Iceland.\nWe have sent official requests to the Central bank, The Financial Supervisory Authority and the Directorate of Internal Revenue. All have responded that there is nothing in our laws that prohibits trade or any general usage of Auroracoin and other cryptocurrencies in Iceland. The Directorate of Internal Revenue has also stated that trade with cryptocurrencies does not include VAT as it is considered as any other currency trade.", "birthday": "2016-03-31T14:15:00+01:00", "date": "2016-03-31 13:15:00", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 31}

Besides, there is no identity attached to any Bitcoin transaction.\nHowever, Jonathan Chester, Forbes expert on the bitcoin and blockchain industry, considers Bitcoin an ineffective method for financing terrorism and provides the following arguments to support his view:\n Bitcoin transaction by itself, without the use of additional technology, does not fully hide a user\u2019s identity. Every transaction and every chain of transactions can be traced. In order to exchange Bitcoins for local currency, a terrorist would either have to create a bitcoin-based goods and services market or to exchange the bitcoins for currencies in markets like the United States, Europe, or China. This weakest part of the bitcoin chain from an anti-money laundering perspective is the liquidation link. But there is already strong regulation implemented to address identity issues around these weak links such as the Payment Services Directive administered by the European Commission. \nOil and guns are more likely to enable terrorism than bitcoins\nGhost Security Group, a collective of computer \u201chacktivists,\u201d says it has located several bitcoin accounts that ISIS uses to fund operations. One account has received the equivalent of about $3 million USD in Bitcoin donations since 2012. Chester remarks that this may seem like a lot at first, but on the other hand, while Bitcoin has led to $3 million in illiquid assets over three years for so-called Islamic State, oil revenue amounts to about $100 million in liquid value a month.\nApart from oil revenue, guns are another means that enables terrorism to a great extent. As Dominic Vogel says to Cointelegraph, \u201cGuns enable terrorists too and we have yet to see the FBI or other law enforcement agencies crack down on guns.\u201d\nDominic Vogel, Chief Security Officer for Netcoins, explains:\n \u201cIt's very myopic framing that focuses only on one threat, namely domestic terrorists. This obscures the fact that encryption provides security against a much broader spectrum of threats and not just terrorists. It is the easy way out for the FBI and law enforcement to say that \u201cencryption enables terrorism.\u201d \nSociety will not be able to function without encryption\nAccording to Vogel, the global economy is incredibly reliant on encryption. Online banking and online shopping require encryption. Without it they would collapse as they would no longer be trustworthy. We use strong encryption every day and our Internet-connected world would be a far riskier place if we didn\u2019t use it.\nEncryption protects critical infrastructure, communications networks, the power grid, and water utilities. As we move to the Internet of Things with cars, thermostats and medical devices, all of which can destroy life and property if not properly encrypted, \u201csociety will not be able to function without encryption\u201d, concludes Vogel.\nGovernments and private corporations already tracking our every move\nThe Paris and Brussels attacks created an atmosphere in which the European Commission must be seen to be doing what it can. Fortune\u2019s David Meyer calls this situation \u201cthe fallout for virtual currencies\u201d. The new legislation \u201cwould force virtual currency platforms to apply more due diligence controls when customers are exchanging virtual for real currencies, by bringing them under the scope of EU anti-money-laundering laws.\u201d Basically, it means no Bitcoin payment privacy in existence from June 2017.", "birthday": "2016-03-28T10:50:00+01:00", "date": "2016-03-28 09:50:00", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 28}

Cointelegraph spoke to Marc De Mesel to learn more about the deal and collect tips on how to make a successful investment in crypto as well as how to invest crypto in a startup.\nBitcoin has performed with varying degrees of success as an investment, multiplying its value over tenfold in late 2013, going down to 20% of that value in 2014, and slowly rising to double that value over the course of 2015. This has provided the opportunity for investors to make significant ROI over very short periods of time, while not being without risk. More recently, Ethereum experienced its own price and market cap spike, much to the benefit of early investors.\nMarc De Mesel admits:\n \u201cUp until now I have never invested in a startup. I did invest in new cryptocurrencies, that I've come to realize, were very much startups too, like NXT and Clam, but this is my first real VC investment.\u201d \nOvercome your false beliefs about society and investing\nOn his own showing, Marc De Mesel used to be a very risk averse investor and preferred to invest in index funds and some gold. However, once he realized that real inflation was more around 6% per year than the government's published numbers of 2%, he had to admit that he didn\u2019t make any real money. That was why he started to take more risks, first by investing in gold mining stocks and in 2012 also into Bitcoin.\nMarc De Mesel on his first real success as an investor says:\n \u201cBy only investing 10% of my portfolio into Bitcoin around $10 I was able to triple my capital in 1 year thanks to Bitcoin going up to $1000. I was, of course, very lucky with my timing, but I also had been working hard to overcome my own false beliefs about society and investing, that lead me to making the investment in Bitcoin in the first place. Many of my friends at the time thought I was crazy to invest in something that had no inherent value and would, for sure, be banned by the\u00a0government\u201d. \nYour portfolio should consist mainly of crypto\nThe investor explains that crypto flows much better - you send it and the other has it immediately. In addition to this,\u00a0it's also a psychological thing: Spending $200 000 dollars is much more difficult than spending 300 BTC and 10 Million NXT. However, De Mesel remarks that, \u201cof course, that only counts if you are already into crypto and your portfolio consists mainly of crypto, as is the case with me\u201d.\nMarc De Mesel talks about his decision to invest crypto in a startup:\n \u201cAt first we actually had a deal that I would invest $100 000, half in Bitcoin, half in USD. But then I proposed to pay the USD part in NXT, as I wanted to lighten up my NXT exposure a bit and also wanted to start using NXT. To my surprise, this was ok for Virgil. I was thrilled by this but when I did my calculation I ended up having to pay 6 million something NXT and 120 btc or so. I wanted to have round numbers that are impressive and was also interested to have a bigger stake in his company as I started believing more in him and the app during the negotiations. So I proposed 300 BTC and 10 Million NXT, he loved it, and we found a deal.\u201d \n\nDo a test transaction and check if the other party has secure wallets\nIt might be nerve-wracking to invest in crypto: a push of the button and it's gone. No way to get it back. For this reason, one should be very careful with the transactions.\nMarc De Mesel shares his own experience:", "birthday": "2016-03-23T10:45:00+00:00", "date": "2016-03-23 10:45:00", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 23}

That's great\u00a0story material\u201d, added Aaron Koenig of Bitfilm Production.\nIn fact, many TV series have mentioned Bitcoin during their episodes. This could be really important news for the cryptocurrency as it could potentially allow Bitcoin to reach more users all around the world.\n\nBad Light Going Dimmer\nUnfortunately, for the most part, Bitcoin is primarily mentioned on TV within the context of the purchasing of drugs, which undoubtedly paints the digital currency in a very bad light.\n\u201cI saw some of these TV series on YouTube. Some are quite funny, but usually they have the same rather low level of understanding of Bitcoin that you find in most\u201d, said Koenig.\nBitcoin for Dummies\nSome mentions of Bitcoin on mainstream TV include:\nThe Good Wife\nIn \u00a0Bitcoin for Dummies (episode 3x13), which aired on January 15 2012, the protagonist, Alicia Florrick, has to defend Stack, a lawyer who doesn\u2019t want to reveal the identity of his client, the unknown Satoshi Nakamoto, who is wanted by the U.S. Treasury Department for creating Bitcoin.\n\u201c\u200bI saw the Good Wife and thought that it was an excellent episode and it was quite early to be talking about Bitcoin on mainstream TV. I believe Bitcoin was mostly mentioned in a negative light, but that's the same for most newspaper headlines and TV news reports at the time. I think by now the general sentiment has switched from a means for illegal drug money and money laundering to revolutionary technology and promising opportunities\"\u200b, said Torsten Hoffmann.\n\nThe Simpsons\nBitcoin has been mentioned on two different episodes of The Simpsons.\nThe first one, \u201cYellow Subterfuge\u201d, Season 25: Ep. 7, aired on December 2013. Krusty the Clown is bankrupted following the Bitcoin market crash. The second, \u201cClown in the Dumps\u201d, Season 26 Ep. 01, aired on September 28 2014.

During the investigation, they discover the existence of an organ market where someone is selling hearts that can be remotely turned off in case of non-payment.\nHouse of Cards\n \u201cChapter 15\u201d, the second episode of season 2, aired on February 2014. It follows the story of Lucas, who is looking for a hacker on the deep web. In his speaking to others he explains what Bitcoin is in the context of the \u2018deep web\u2019. \nSupernatural\nIn October 2014, the episode, \u201cPaper Moon\u201d (10x4) spoke about Bitcoin.\nSilicon Valley\nBitcoin is mentioned during \u2018Articles of Incorporation\u2019, \u00a0the third episode of season 1.\n Dunn: Hey, Dinesh.

If digital currency is going to gain wider adoption, strong consumer protections and oversight (to help ensure that customer money doesn\u2019t fall into a black hole) will be critical.\u201d \nA number of companies, such as Bitfinex, BitQuick, BTCGuild, Eobot, Genesis Mining, GoCoin, Kraken, LocalBitcoins, Paxful, and Poloniex, made a decision to leave New York in order not to have to deal with BitLicense. \u201cThis particular piece of legislation is unnecessary and is an obstacle to free market innovation,\u201d wrote Genesis Mining on its blog.

Today you can operate from the comfort of your home, without having to invest in a huge data center and still mine Bitcoin or other alternative currencies. Yet like traditional mining operations, there are investments to be made in order to reap rewards. So where is cloud mining headed?\nThe Ins and Outs of Cloud Mining\nCloud mining, sometimes called remote mining, is just the same as mining cryptocurrencies, but without needing to invest in hardware yourself. Think of it as piggybacking on professional-grade remote hardware provided by a cloud mining services provider. You could mine Bitcoin or other altcoins like Litecoin or Ethereum.\nEssentially, cloud mining is a service that you pay for and in return you get \u201chashing power\u201d hosted in data centers and sold in Gigahash/seconds (GH/s). As a buyer, you will select the desired amount of GH/s and a period of contract you would like to mine for.\nNo requirement for investment\nThere are many reasons to consider cloud mining. The principle reason being that there is no requirement for any investment in mining hardware. Cloud mining is fully scalable, this means that you can buy the capacity you want based on your own needs and ambitions. There are fixed maintenance and electricity costs and novices who have never mined before can wet their feet before taking a full on plunge into mining on their own.\nCost of entry smaller\nThe costs of entry into cloud mining are significantly smaller than starting a full-on mining setup of your own. Hashflare, for example, offers a 10 GH/s plan with unlimited contract for as low as $ 2.20. Miners should keep in mind that since there are costs to be borne by the cloud mining company, the profitability of cloud mining is significantly lower than doing it on your own.

This is especially useful for podcasts and other decentralized media forms, many of whom offer their service for free in hopes of receiving voluntary donations, making their operating margins potentially slim.\nCointelegraph spoke with several independent media outlets, from podcasts to radio to video shows, about the unique considerations provided by deriving funding from Bitcoin.\nA significant source of income\nMark Edge, host of radio show Free Talk Live, indicates that Bitcoin income is around \u201c20% now, sometimes lower. 50%+ at times in the past,\u201d while Rodger Paxton of the LAVA Flow Podcast claims: \u201cI receive about half of my income from my podcast by bitcoin.\u201d Brian Sovryn, host of technology and futurism podcast Sovryn Tech, also receives a similar ratio.\n \u201cI do a podcast called Sovryn Tech that has been covering Bitcoin since its inception, and so I pretty quickly set up a Bitcoin donation address and that has worked out well for me over the years. Sometimes it's from quite a few listeners in small amounts, and other times someone will donate once a year or a every few months with a significant amount.\u201d \nSovryn is also an indie game developer, and the ratio of Bitcoin received in that pursuit is significantly higher.\n \u201cWhile my donations for my podcasts and blog posts are often varied between Bitcoin donation or PayPal donation, it's very different in that 87% of my PC game sales are with Bitcoin.\u201d \n\nConvenient, low cost donations\nPaxton prefers donations in Bitcoin because of the ease of setup and relative absence of fees.\n \u201cI love that there are no fees. Both Patreon and PayPal have very large fees that eat into my profit, so I encourage everyone I can to use Bitcoin to send me their donations.\u201d \nEdge maintains some concerns over slower transactions and higher fees recently over Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit, saying \u201cI would really like to see the Devs come to some agreement.\u201d Sovryn appreciated the relative ease of setup compared to other donation systems.\n \u201cIt was really easy to setup, and without having to go through PayPal's hassle of verifying identity and all of that, which really is a pain. And I ended up being able to either put a QR code at the end of a blog post, or just put the actual address in the show notes for a podcast episode. It was way easier to implement the means to get a donation in Bitcoin than any other system, so that was definitely another impetus to start using it.\u201d \nIdeologically free-market\nFor cryptocurrency and peer-to-peer network evangelist (and former Cointelegraph contributor) Amanda B.

This time we look into possible approaches to the dispute resolution.\nPreviously the different obstacles that impeded the application of the traditional law enforcement environment to DAOs and the necessity for dispute resolution mechanisms were discussed. Below you will find a couple of possible ways that may alleviate this situation but the answer to the problem requires an out of the box approach to disputes and their role in commercial transactions.\nPossible but fundamentally flawed approaches\nOne way DAOs could settle disputes is by appointing a legal representative who would act as the only real world link to the company. \u00a0Why would a DAO establish a legal representative in the first place is quite simple: other DAOs and large businesses won\u2019t transact with shady DAOs who can\u2019t be held responsible for their actions, so from a commercial point of view it makes sense to, while looking to preserve the investors identifications, build a structure that is capable of committing to a deal and be held responsible for its actions.\nThe key aspect to this approach is that if the legal representative is the only physical person that can be linked to the DAO this person needs to have access to the DAOs funds. Why? because eventually he would need to comply with the sentence. If a DAO is found guilty of breaching a contract and its only link to the real world is a person who doesn\u2019t have the power to execute the court\u2019s sentence then we are back to square one.\nThis approach, while quite simple at first glance, comes with a few notable obstacles.\nFirst: while proving that the legal representative has access to the funds on day one of the dispute would be pretty straightforward, making sure that the DAO doesn\u2019t remove his access would be a concern.\nSecond: while this would work for commercial and civil disputes, if the DAO was accused of committing a crime then, as you may imagine, it\u2019s legal representative can\u2019t be held responsible for the actions of its client unless he took part in the crime himself.\nOther possible solution would be to set up the DAO addresses as a multisig scheme with a trusted third party guardian who, in the case of a legal dispute, would release the payment if needed. This mechanism is not desirable because the DAOs funds would depend on the good behaviour of the third party arbitrator who could either be bribed or just run away with the funds.\nPrevent rather than amend\nThe logic so far is clear: if the DAO can\u2019t be trusted to voluntarily execute a sentence nor can it trust a third party with its funds then the only possible solution is to avoid the dispute altogether.\nThis may shock some people but it\u2019s actually the most reasonable answer to the problem. Commercial relationships don\u2019t need litigations to exist, it just happens that up until recently there were no realistic means to avoid such disputes. Before smart contracts existed parties needed to trust each other to carry on their part of the agreement; A pays B and just hopes for B to sent him the item they agreed on. If B did not then a court would intervene and try to get to a fair solution.\nBitcoin and Ethereum Logic", "birthday": "2016-03-26T14:14:00+00:00", "date": "2016-03-26 14:14:00", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 26}

Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy by Melanie Swan\nMelanie Swan is the founder of the Institute for Blockchain Studies, an independent institution that aims at examining the implications of the decentralized ledger.\nThis book is very useful to understand how the Blockchain works and its application for the real life. The Swan\u2019s effort is concentrated on a deep explaination of how the decentralized ledger works, before trying to investigate the Bitcoin case.\nOf course Bitcoin and Blockchain are inseparable, but Swan aims at letting readers understand most of all the pratical use of the ledger, its regulation and proof-of-existence value.\n\"[I decided to write the book] in October 2014 when I realized that blockchains were a modernizing information technology that extends well beyond digital currencies, smart contracts, and automated Dapps, DAOs, & DACs; that blockchains mean a completely new era of the Internet with decentralized secure value transfer facilitated by algorithmic trust, not only making everything we do now more efficient, automatable, and trackable, but also opening up the possibility a much larger and truly global-scale of projects than have been possible before in hierarchical models)\u201d, explained Swan.\n\n3.\u00a0Blockchain Revolution by Don Tapscott and Alex Tapscott\nSome days ago we talked about Don Tapscott and his suggestion on how the blockchain could disrupt services as AirBnb and Uber.\nThis is just one example of Tapscott\u2019s ideas about the Blockchain and how this ledger is a revolutionary invention.\nTapscott himself is the author of a new book called \u201cBlockchain Revolution\u201d, in which he explains all the Blockchain implications and application in our daily life.\nThis book will come out on May 10th, but we had the chance to talk with Tapscott, who explained us how his new book is very unique:\n\u201cBlockchain Revolution is not just the \"best\" book. It is the only book, significant book, on the blockchain revolution\u201d, he commented.\n \u201cFrom a broader perspective this is an advocacy book. \u00a0We don\u2019t think that the future is something to be predicted, it\u2019s something to be achieved. \u00a0Blockchain technologies hold vast potential but there are many obstacles to be overcome. \u00a0The goal of the book is to explain the opportunities for businesses, industries and society to achieve prosperity, competitiveness and social justice. \u00a0It\u2019s really about book about how the second generation of the Internet (based on blockchain technologies) can change civilization for the better\u201d. \n\u201c[We decided to write this book] Two years ago at a father son ski trip. \u00a0We had already been doing research on the governance of digital currencies as part of a $4 million research project I founded on new models of global governance\u201d, said Tapscott.\nAuthors will launch a campaign giving a set of infographics about key themes in the book for anyone who pre-orders \u201cBlockchain Revolution\u201d. \u00a0\nThese infographics will be: \u201cBlockchain and the Music Industry\u201d, \u201cBlockchain Business Models\u201d, \u201cOvercoming Obstacles\u201d.\nTo have these additional contents you need to pre-order the book and forward Amazon confirmation email to jenna@tapscott.com.\n\n4.

In honor of St. Patrick\u2019s Day, Cointelegraph investigates just how much Ireland had been impacted by Bitcoin.\nAlthough Bitcoin and cryptocurrency news coming from Ireland is somewhat few and far between, it would be wholly unfair to say that Ireland is devoid of the innovative technology.\nBeer and bread, the Irish way\nAs is well-known across the globe, the Irish have quite the taste for beer, so it is to no one\u2019s surprise that one of Bitcoin\u2019s first commercial uses in Ireland came in the forum of retailing pints of beer.\nThe pub in question, the Baggot Inn, installed a Robocoin ATM to encourage customers to trial the new payment system, with the first Bitcoin-bought pint being served in March 2014 to Michael Rudnicki. For those of you beer aficionados, it happened to be a bottle of Kopparberg cider, which he bought for 0.0093 BTC, worth \u20ac4.50 at time, but only \u20ac3.45 now, meaning you\u2019d have to shell out 0.01 BTC if you wanted a pint nowadays.\n\nSadly, after a change in management at the pub, the BTM and Bitcoin payment system were removed in October 2014, with the new owners saying:\n \u201cWe regret to announce [that] due to ongoing issues regarding the legality of Bitcoin ATMs in the Republic of Ireland, we can no longer accept Bitcoin payments.\u201d \nHowever, another fine institution, Healy\u2019s Lounge of Ballycastle, County Mayo, claims to have sold over 200 pints since it first introduced Bitcoin payments.\nAnother retailer venturing into the world of Bitcoin is Kr\u00fcst Bakery, Ireland\u2019s first Bitcoin-accepting bakery. It made its first Bitcoin sale of cronuts and coffee on 18th July 2014 to Peter Oakes, a former director of the Central Bank of Ireland, and Garrett Cassidy, the European head of Circle.\n\nThe Dublin-based retailer, co-founded by Garret Flower and Rob Kramer, said their decision to begin accepting Bitcoin was down to the increasing number of startups and students in the bakery\u2019s surrounding area.\n\u201cDigital currencies are still in their early days but they are becoming more and more mainstream. Consumers will be using digital currencies more and more to buy goods and services. That\u2019s what our business hopes to do by setting up our European headquarters in Dublin.\u201d, said Cassidy.\nDrugs over Deep Net: Ireland No Exception\nThe topic that always seems to dominate the news when it comes to Bitcoin is the buying and selling of drugs over the \u2018deep net\u2019. Ireland is no exception, as in December 2015, when Neil Mannion, 34, and Richard O\u2019Connor, 34, a bitcoin trader and a film technician respectively, were jailed for the possession of drugs, including LSD, amphetamine, and cannabis resin, worth \u20ac143,000, with intent to supply. The first was given six and a half years, with the latter receiving only three years\nThe arrests were made following a garda [police force of Ireland] raid on their \u2018business premises\u2019 in south Dublin in October 2014. When details arose at their sentencing in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court, O\u2019Connor revealed that he was paid up to \u20ac600 a week to post packages to customers in countries including Japan, Argentina, the Czech Republic, and the United States.\nBitcoin ATMs: From Coco Cafe to Hippety\u2019s\nBitcoin ATMs have had semi-limited success in Ireland. From the get-go, they have faced multiple issues. The first Bitcoin ATM was supposed to be installed at Hippety\u2019s Cafe in the Temple Bar area of Dublin, but following complications, it was instead launched in March 2014 at the nearby GSM Solutions electronic store.\nFurthermore, the Ireland-based Bitcoin ATM provider, BitVendo, that installed the Lamassu BTM, was refused an account with the Bank of Ireland in 2014, which very much limited their capabilities for expansion. The company was bought out by BitEx.ie that same year. Bitcoin-related companies being refused bank accounts, not only in Ireland, but around the world, has proved to be quite a problem for many in recent years.\nHowever, the news is not all bad.

Its main competitors, OKCoin and zTrader, are also working on making their app more attractive to customers. Bitfinex is a popular Bitcoin, Litecoin and Darkcoin trading platform. It has introduced a swathe of new features, graphical changes, optimizations, and bug fixes.\nPublic Release\nThe major update, \u2018Update 1.9.5\u2019, made the following changes to Bitfinex\u2019s iOS and Android apps:\n \u201cMajor Changes   iOS App - Public release of Bitfinex app for iOS. For improved security and customization the app uses an API key that you can generate with varied permissions. This allows for complex permissions control for your mobile app. Please read the setup instructions carefully (Android app also available).   Security - Users can now disable currencies and trading pairs from Account Settings > Currencies & Pairs.   Interface - The 3 main site sections (Exchange, Margin Trading, and Margin Funding) have been moved up to the top of the page as tabs.   Minor Changes   Introduce \"quick transfers\" between wallets.

However, the introduction of better coverage for Chinese- and Russian-language customers means greater accessibility, and therefore hopefully increased trading - good news for sellers looking to get a swift profit on a temporarily inflated Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Darkcoin price.\nCointelegraph spoke to the Ukrainian-born lead developer at Emercoin, Oleg Khovayko, about what he thought about the improved Russian-language coverage on the Bitfinex app:\n \u201cThis is good news, since it will increase the adoption of Bitfinex by ex-USSR customers. However, to promote their services, they need to advertise on Russian-language-oriented sources, like ctyptor.net, bits.media, etc. Or, they could even use emcLNX to attract Russian customers.\u201d \nDevelopments arising from the introduction of better coverage for Chinese-language customers may also be of interest. As mentioned below, one of Bitfinex\u2019s main competitors, OKCoin, is the biggest Bitcoin exchange in China, so could see customers move to this new player if it offers a wider array of features.\nMobile trading platform alternatives", "birthday": "2016-03-17T17:10:00+00:00", "date": "2016-03-17 17:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 17}

While smart contracts and their benefits are nothing new to the community one of the more disruptive use cases, DAOs have not been explored to the extent they deserve.\nZero corruption, transparent government\nFor those who never heard of DAOs before \u201cA DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a digital company with its by-laws set immutably within the Blockchain: its governance is transparent, its finances can be audited by anyone, it suffers zero downtime and corruption is impossible,\u201d according to Slock.it, a company which is planning to launch their own DAO in the near future.\nDAOs enable a wide range of possible business models that were previously impossible or too costly run. Think for example of a Kickstarter-style project where the backers do not just give their money and wait for the kickstarted company to deliver the final product, but on one where an abstract or desired product description is proposed by an individual or group and then investors provide funds which are automatically converted into a special token.\nIn this model, the investors can choose, by voting with their tokens, which company they will hire to get their vision done. They will be able to influence every aspect of the product if the code of the DAO allows it. If they are not happy with one or all of their service providers they can fire them and hire new ones.\nAll the previous is made possible because of smart contracts which can be run, for example, on the Ethereum Network. It\u2019s just natural to assume that there will even be free open source \u201ctemplates\u201d for DAOs created for the non programming savvy entrepreneurs.\nThe number and different combinations of innovative and disruptive companies that can be created this way is mind blowing; and while this technology certainly seems viable there are a lot of interesting questions that still remain unanswered; especially when you take into consideration the vast number of dubious ways that this technology could be used. Consider for a second what are the ramifications of a DAO that\u2019s explicitly constituted to bypass, or even explicitly infringe, laws and regulations.\nDecentralized hedge funds\nAn interesting example of the aforementioned is a DAO which purpose in life is to be a decentralized version of a hedge fund. Now, just for the sake of the argument let\u2019s imagine that a particular stock market broker allows its clients to be DAOs, or more probably doesn\u2019t even care.\nAt this point you have a DAO, which is nothing more than very well organized lines of code with a determined amount of money, maybe even cryptocurrencies, to invest and whose shareholders may be impossible to track if it's cryptographically powered privacy is strong enough. This situation may result in the absolute abolishment of insider trading. How? Well, imagine a DAO as the previously described and a shareholder who has obtained non-public information that will skyrocket or plunge a security price.\nTaking advantage of this situation under a strong privacy-focused DAO would be easy. If authorities try to track down the person responsible the first entity in line is the DAO, which as we explained is nothing more than lines of code, so they have to determine the identity of the shareholders which may prove to be impossible.", "birthday": "2016-03-21T14:10:00+00:00", "date": "2016-03-21 14:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 21}

Bitcoin microtransactions could prove to be the solution to this problem.\nHuge problem\nPageFair is a website devoted to finding solutions to the problem of ad-blocking. In their global report on ad-blocking, \u2018The 2015 Ad Blocking Report\u2019, they released the following surprising figures:\n Ad blocking was estimated to cost publishers nearly $22 billion during 2015. There are now 198 million active adblock users around the world. Ad blocking grew by 41% globally in the last 12 months. US ad blocking grew by 48% to reach 45 million active users in 12 months up to June 2015. UK ad blocking grew by 82% to reach 12 million active users in 12 months up to June 2015. \nAs a result, content creators must adapt to a generation of people who are not necessarily prepared to accept advertising on their favourite websites. Bitcoin could provide a solution to this problem.\n\nBitcoin solution\nDue to Bitcoin\u2019s low transactional fees, it would be ideal for microtransaction payments for viewing sites on the internet. There are multiple startups in the cryptocurrency community who are looking to see widespread implementation.\nPopChest, as discussed in a previous article, \u201cis a service that allows YouTubers and video producers to earn money from their videos without the need for advertising. Users pay a very small fee in Bitcoin, usually $0.25 (approximately 0.000414 BTC at the time of my writing), to watch the content producer\u2019s video. This directly supports the creator, and also allows users to see exclusive content. PopChest has had limited success, but recently, a YouTuber with 600,000 subscribers signed up for the service, creating a surge in interest.\u201d\nHowever, PopChest only solves the issue of ad-blocking on videos. Another startup, Satoshipay, hopes to address ad-blocking across all content.

Casual observers of history often conclude that the industry must be riddled with greedy, inept and dishonest professionals whose excessive appetite for yield and large compensation packages outweighs the needs of society. As a self-proclaimed student of the financial industry who has spent more than half his life working within this industry and studying the history and current rules of the global financial system. I can tell you that both the industry at large and the regulatory bodies that oversee them consist of many talented individuals and institutions of very high character who care about society.\" \n\nTainted by Scandal\nIts failures, however, have been quite devastating and, in most cases, the result of those who targeted the vulnerable or ill-informed, whether it be\u00a0Charles Ponzi\u00a0in the 1920\u2019s or more recently\u00a0Bernie Madoff.\nThese scandals have certainly played a role in tainting the industry\u2019s image but it\u2019s the more systemic problems, such as the 2008\u00a0GFC, that have hurt the industry the most as they often result in global contagion, affecting all levels of society.\nIt is these problems that worry me most as they are unintentional and typically the result of shortsightedness, inadequate controls, poor management oversight, failed policies or a simple lack of in-depth knowledge of products, processes and the rules that govern them.\nBlockchain, the Legitimate Prescription\u00a0\nIn a less complex environment, I believe Blockchain ledger and smart contract technologies provide the global financial industry with its first legitimate opportunity to transform itself into an industry with a much healthier ecosystem able to overcome the aforementioned issues to regain the trust of society.\nIn this perfect world, Blockchain technology would allow the industry to replace certain of its outdated multi-layered technology infrastructures, associated processes and business models.\nIn this simple environment, the industry would be able to perform almost anything on an open ledger with smart contracts including customer onboarding, establishing customer agreements, providing risk, fee and conflict-of-interest disclosures, finalize and agree contractual terms on anything from securities transactions to mortgage loans to insurance contracts.\nTo even forming and transacting loan and underwriting syndications amongst institutions, operating securities finance facilities such as securities lending and repurchase agreements or even operating entire limited partnerships and master trusts on semi-private ledgers.\nMoreover, although unfamiliar by the broader public, a rather significant use for the industry also involves vast reporting that occurs after the fact where most global financial institutions today are mandated, by jurisdictional rules or laws, to report certain financial transactions to local regulators.\nAlleviating Burdens\nThis reporting often involves anything from stock and bond orders and trades (or trade and transaction reports), customer securities account free credit and margin balances or\u00a0Client Asset Reports, CMAR\u2019s, Call Reports, CTR\u2019s (currency transaction reports), large trader reporting,\u00a0Electronic Blue Sheets\u00a0and so much more.\nIf the financial industry developed Blockchain technology in such a way that it created ledgers that were accessible or visible by regulators and/or outside service providers, much of these additional very burdensome reporting processes and associated costs would be eliminated, or at a minimum significantly reduced, whilst allowing regulators to monitor markets and firms in real-time more transparently to reduce risk and market manipulation.", "birthday": "2016-03-11T09:00:00+00:00", "date": "2016-03-11 09:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 11}

The aim is to make the wallets easier to use and more reliable.\nMany users have difficulty memorizing the address of their wallet. This problem is faced by many exchanges as, for mass adoption of Bitcoin by casual users who don\u2019t have knowledge of cryptography to occur, there must be a simpler way of presenting the long list of numbers that is a wallet address.\nCointelegraph reached out to Global Business Development Head at\u00a0Coinsecure, Elizabeth McCauley, asking for her thoughts on the matter.\nCT: Will it be possible for users to create a wallet name without using their real name?\nElizabeth McCauley:\u00a0A person can create whichever ID he would like as long as the name is still available.\nCT: Will it be possible to create separate wallets for different functions?\nEM: One can only create 1 coinsecure wallet name and 1 coinsecure exchange wallet name, i.e. 2 with single email id. However, someone could have different Netki wallet ids if using different domains - ie: two different wallet companies utilizing Netki's service.\n\nGrowing prominence in India\nCT: What does Bitcoin adoption and trading look like in India?\nEM: BTC adoption is growing in India. Coinsecure currently has the largest volume for an exchange in India and we are seeing over 3,000 BTC in volume each month. Lower globally, but high for India as Bitcoin is growing in prominence in India. We have been observing great volumes since September. The trading volumes for Coinsecure only have been around USD 1 million a month so the prominence is rising.\nCointelegraph also spoke to Business Development Manager at\u00a0Netki, Jeffrey Handler:\nCT: How does Netki solve the problem of privacy?\nJeffrey Handler: Netki uses Secure DNS(DNSSEC) to take care of name storage and mapping between a name and an address. In this way, we help preserve end-user privacy by keeping the name to address mapping off of a permanent public ledger, such as the Bitcoin blockchain. For example, if I send BTC to a Wallet Name like 'jeff.coinsecure.me', only the public wallet address associated with that name will be recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. There is no public directory that associates Wallet Names with public wallet addresses.\nNetki Wallet Names work with both HD Wallets and BIP70 Payment Requests.\u00a0HD wallets (BIP32) help protect users against the privacy leaks associated with the repeated use of static addresses, by providing a way to generate a new public address (linked to a user\u2019s private key) for each transaction that she initiates.\nIn this way, if I give my Wallet Name to 100 different people, 100 unique public addresses will be associated with the name, making it much more difficult for the privacy leaks that can occur with transaction link ability. Payment Requests complement HD wallets, by allowing a sender to ensure that she is actually paying the correct/desired recipient, before she permanently signs away her funds. The combination of HD wallets and Payment Requests with Wallet Names enhances privacy and security for end users, while making the process of transacting more human friendly / trustworthy to less technical users.\nMoreover, Netki has created, and open-sourced a service, Addressimo, which makes it easy for wallet providers to add BIP32 and BIP70 extensions to their platform. Netki has also, in conjunction with Breadwallet, published BIP75, which extends BIP70 payment requests to work more securely with mobile and desktop wallets.", "birthday": "2016-03-12T10:36:00+00:00", "date": "2016-03-12 10:36:00", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 12}

The swarm-based activism campaign was organized against the city of Portsmouth for banning ride-sharing,\nCointelegraph spoke to Christopher David, Arcade City\u2019s founder, about integrating the Ethereum Blockchain into the operations of a ride-sharing company\nCointelegraph: What made you decide to use Ethereum?\nChristopher David: Ethereum offers the whole package: a platform with everything we need, plus a strong community with solid governance. More than any particular set of technical features, the main deciding factor was that the vision of Ethereum aligns precisely with our own vision of peer-to-peer transportation and distributed logistics. Any problems that we'll need to solve to implement our decentralized business model -- like identity, reputation, payments, cryptoequity -- we know there will be brilliant minds working to solve the same issues. Sealing the deal for us was the tremendous support we've received so far from Ethereum early adopters, even despite our early stages of integration. We know the Ethereum community will be great partners for us moving forward.\nCT: Will Arcade City use Ethereum extensively? What will integration look like?\nCD: We intend for Arcade City to be one of the first large 'mainstream' Ethereum companies. That will require tailoring its implementation to our userbase of non-technical users \u2014 riders and drivers \u2014 who will be engaged in peer-to-peer transactions all over the world. By beginning with a conventional \u2018minimum viable product\u2019 in the Android and Apple app stores earlier this month, we\u2019ve been able to build a userbase willing to test new features and provide feedback. We are beginning immediately to build components of our ridesharing model in Ethereum, starting with identity and reputation systems. Our first goal is to deliver a working proof of concept of an Ethereum-based reputation system by the end of April. The many rules that govern reputation for rides will be encoded as smart contracts, editable by consensus. If in testing our drivers agree that too many driver reputation points are being lost after negative reviews by first-time riders, the relevant smart contract can be modified. Obviously that brings up other considerations of governance and consensus. We\u2019ll want to learn all we can from others in the community, and maintain an open, well-documented process to communicate our experiences so others can learn along with us. Later we will extend the reputation system with an eye toward abstracting away from ridesharing-specific structures, moving toward interoperability with other systems in other industries. Piece by piece, we\u2019ll go through a similar process of Ethereum proof of concept, testing and iteration, and abstraction. We\u2019ll do that for as many components of our business model as we can feasibly move to the blockchain, including governance, financing, and eventually even insurance and adjudication.\n", "birthday": "2016-03-15T10:20:00+00:00", "date": "2016-03-15 10:20:00", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 15}

The cryptocurrency called RSCoin will also function on Blockchain, the distributed ledger system on which Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built.\nEarlier, in January 2016, China\u2019s National Bank also announced plans to launch a virtual currency.\nRadical Shift from Traditional Crypto\nRSCoin was originally developed by researchers at the University College of London (UCL) which provides greater centralized control compared to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nThe original paper published by the UCL researchers behind RSCoin explained:\n \u201cRSCoin\u2019s radical shift from traditional cryptocurrencies is to centralize the monetary supply. Every unit of a particular currency is created by a particular central bank, making cryptocurrencies based on RSCoin significantly more palatable to governments. Despite this centralization, RSCoin still provides the benefit over existing (non-crypto) currencies of a transparent transaction ledger, a distributed system for maintaining it, and a globally visible monetary supply. This makes monetary policy transparent, allows direct access to payments and value transfers, supports pseudonymity, and benefits from innovative uses of blockchains and digital money.\u201d \nIn this case, the Bank of England would be the singular controller for the Blockchain and the encryption key that allows the subtraction or addition of the cryptocurrency from the Blockchain.\nMatthew Commons, the CEO of Cambridge Blockchain LLC, explained:\n \u201cRSCoin is perhaps best described as a \"hybrid\" approach between the distributed model of bitcoin and conventional centralized fiat currency. \u00a0In the hybrid model, a central bank delegates the authority of validating transactions to a number of other institutions that are called \"mintettes\"; they are known and can be held legally accountable for their actions. \u00a0This test should help provide validation as to whether such an approach is sustainable and scalable.\u201d \nSignificance of RSCoin\nMatthew Commons spoke favorably and said RSCoin will bear great significance:\n \u201cAround the world, policymakers are reexamining how a digital currency controlled by a central bank might provide faster, lower cost payments with more traceability.

Programmers and businessmen proposed various sizes, without fully clarifying the economic impact. Let\u2019s put the horse in front of the carriage by laying out the economic effects of larger vs smaller block size first, so that Bitcoiners can then choose appropriate technical solutions.\nAn economic good is something that is both useful and scarce. Air is useful, but generally, air is not scarce. Hence, air is not an economic good and there exists no price for it. On a submarine, air is scarce. In this situation, air becomes an economic good. It gets a definite price, which in turn determines the value of the machinery that produces the air, the salaries of the people that make the machinery (at least in capitalism) and so on. Understanding scarcity and economic goods is prerequisite for understanding the effect of transaction scarcity, or its absence.\nBitcoin price as a variable of hoarding\nCurrency derives its value from hoarding. Every time somebody spends currency, they value having the currency less than having the acquired good or service. When people hoard currency, they value holding the currency more than having any other good or service or alternative currency. They could exchange it, but they prefer not to, thereby manifesting the currency\u2019s value compared to all other goods, services and alternative currencies.\nAll benefits of a currency manifest themselves in the question of whether it is being hoarded or not. If a token can hardly be transferred to others, people will not even accept it. If a token can be multiplied easily, people will not hoard it. If a token is perishable, people will not hoard it. But if it ticks all the boxes, people value having it and will try to hold on to it as long as they can.\nSecurity is crucial\nTransaction fees reduce the value of a coin by a fraction, but a lack of security can reduce its value completely (theft). Hence, the critical variable for Bitcoin hoarding is its security, which depends on network hash power. The more hash power, the more people trust the network and the more people are willing to hoard the coin over longer periods instead of spending it, thereby increasing its value relative to all other goods and currencies.\nCryptocurrency security requires an ongoing amount of expenditure for electricity, hardware, maintenance and network fees. These costs are currently covered by block rewards, but rewards will become irrelevant. Miners must eventually rely on transaction fees to run their operations. The amount of fees collected corresponds to the amount of security that can be provided.\nCompetition and cartels\nEverybody is allowed to mine Bitcoins, so there will never be a mining monopoly. The original meaning of monopoly is an act of government that prevents certain people to engage in certain businesses. As long as no \u201cworld government\u201d interferes, there is competition in Bitcoin mining.\nImagine a mining cartel, where miners agree to only process transactions with fees above X. As long as there is a single miner outside of the cartel, the effective fees will be below X. Why? Because the external miner will include as many paying transactions as possible in each block he manages to win. Ceteris paribus, this miner would be more profitable than cartel miners, because he does not leave money on the table. His mining power would therefore grow relative to the cartel miners\u2019, reducing their profits, at which point the cartel becomes silly. In reality, the mere threat of \u201cexternal\u201d competitors prevents cartels.\nCompetition means that no miner excludes paying transactions if there is space for them. Doing so would only make his competitors richer. Users would know that, and since most people do not wish to pay more than others for the same good, transaction fees drop. But how far?\nUnlimited block size\nIn case of unlimited or quasi-unlimited numbers of transactions, meaning that in almost all cases transaction space exceeds transaction demand, the transaction fee tends towards one satoshi.\nAgain, a miner competes with all other miners and so would hurt himself by leaving paying transactions on the table for the next miner to collect, no matter how small. Hence, every paying transaction is included immediately. As before, users would take note and, since nobody likes paying more than everyone else, everyone will start paying less and less, until the minimum price that must be paid is reached: one satoshi. Even then, no miner will exclude one-satoshi fees, since doing so would only increase the profit of the winner of the next block. However, such very small fees would severely restrict the overall size of mining operations, especially compared to the value they are protecting.\nMost people understand that security costs money, one way or another. At the same time, nobody likes paying more than the market rate and most people don\u2019t like to subsidize free-riders, at least not indefinitely. Users will start worrying how much security can be bought with one-satoshi-fees, conclude \u201cnot much\u201d and stop hoarding.\nLimited block size", "birthday": "2016-03-14T18:59:00+00:00", "date": "2016-03-14 18:59:00", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 14}

So, how and why exactly did the downward trend of Bitcoin\u2019s price, that started on March 4th, happen?\nDuring Cointelegraph\u2019s monthly analysis, we discovered that there was a good chance of a decline to previous levels, due to Bitcoin\u2019s price being in a position which is usual for a change of cycles.\n\nEarlier, we defined key weekly/medium-term levels of $420 and $445, which were responsible for one of the several potential scenarios for further development of the long-term trend. The Bitcoin price was fluctuating between them for a while, bouncing off the top of $445 and, without fortifying there, falling back to the bottom of $420.\n\nThus, there was no opportunity for a continuation of the medium-term upward trend. That was the first indicator of the future decline, which would support the recoil of the larger cycle.\nAnother significant confirmation was the fortification at the level of $420. It was that event which might have been responsible for the decline to the minimal point of $400.\nA break through the level of $417, and fortification there, were the last two things which confirmed the downward trend. The $417 mark was the decision point, not only for the short-term, but also for the medium-term trend. We wrote about the time of choice on Friday, March 4th.\n\nUltimately, there was a possibility of a recoil within the larger trend. The change of cycles was the reason for that possibility. There was a break through the key resistance point of $420, which was protecting the medium-term upward trend. The price fortified there and formed a short-term downward trend, which resulted in a natural decline.\nIn our analysis, we said that the price would probably stop at $400, but BTC/USD has actually stopped a bit below that - at $390; that is because the level is always a certain range, just like $410-$420.", "birthday": "2016-03-06T16:31:00+00:00", "date": "2016-03-06 16:31:00", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 6}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/death-sentence-for-the-worlds-most-popular-cryptocurrency", "title": " Death Sentence for the World\u2019s Most Popular Cryptocurrency ", "content": "Bitcoin will soon be dead, claims David Yermack, chairman of the Finance Department at NYU\u2019s Stern School of \u00a0Business. He blames the democratic process of decision-making in the Bitcoin community for the cryptocurrency\u2019s problems.\nYermack says:\n \u201cYou have a bottleneck in the technology and as it grows, the bottleneck worsens. It\u2019s like trying to fit more cars on the highway where the highway needs to be widened at some point.\u201d \nToo many people using Bitcoin\nHe thinks that too many people have begun to employ Bitcoin. As a result, the payment system has become overcrowded. As opposed to processing payments instantly, it is taking hours in some instances. Hundreds of thousands of transactions are in a queue at any given time waiting to be processed, and merchants that had earlier accepted Bitcoin are now hesitating and dropping out.\nDo the experts from the cryptocurrency world agree?\n\u201cThis isn't the first time Bitcoin has been called 'dead' and it seems he has been reading from the banks\u2019 Blockchain developers cheat sheet\u00a0- Mike Hearn\" -\u00a0Simon Dixon\n\u201cBitcoin needs to adjust to scale. There are billions on the line and Bitcoin will rather adjust than die. When a company has to make changes, they fight behind the closed doors of a boardroom. With Bitcoin, we debate in the open so it looks like crisis, when it is the usual process for any large company worth billions making major changes,\u201d says Simon Dixon, the CEO of BnkToTheFuture.com and Fund Manager Bitcoin Capital.\nTone Vays, head of research at BraveNewCoin, also ridiculed Yermack\u2019s claims:\n \u201cVendors will not drop out because it's taking a few hours to process transactions. For starters, Credit Card transactions take 3-6 months to process and being a finance professor, I hope he knows that, but our educational system does have a problem with theoretical instructors who never worked in the industry or owned a business. If merchants are dropping out, it's because there use Bitcoin at the moment not enough. Another point is that Bitcoin is a new type of asset first and payment processor second, so all these little transactions in the backlog will be going off Chain in the near future if the Core team is left alone to work on the protocol.\u201d \nSelfish Miners Killing Bitcoin\nThe second concern of Yermack is that \u201cthe service now has thousands of \u2018miners\u2019, or people who are paid 25 Bitcoins to clear a transaction. In order for the system to expand, these miners need to agree on a solution. People who now have the fastest computers continue to profit, and most of those people happen to be in China. They have no reason to change rules because it will benefit others at their expense.\n\nSimon thinks Yermack\u2019s concerns are baseless because miners will agree that cutting mining margins is a better outcome than letting Bitcoin 'die'.\nTone Vays appeals people to give a free market a chance. He says:\n \u201cEven if the majority of current miners are in China, the halving of the reward may cause this geographical advantage to decrease. In the future, if Bitcoin works and millions of people use it, the power users will run small miners just to support and decentralize the network even at a small yearly loss.

Definitely. But the crucial point that many miss is that without the decentralization offered by Bitcoin, a private Blockchain is not much different than simply another database. This is especially important if you rely on long-term public availability of the data in that Blockchain, because a Bitcoin-based blockchain is not dependent on a host company remaining in business. I think we also see a tendency for large organizations to \"dip their toes\" into the Bitcoin world by first experimenting with Blockchain.

After the much-touted Peacekeeper failed to produce a workable app, Cell 411 burst on to the scene with an app that works as an emergency dispatch service with a potential response efficiency far surpassing that of law enforcement.\nCointelegraph spoke with the crypto-anarchist, activist and journalist Virgil V\u01ceduva about decentralized emergency response applications and their role in changing the future of governance and security.\nCointelegraph: What originally prompted the creation of Cell 411?\nVirgil V\u01ceduva: As a crypto-anarchist interested in the topic of the police state here in the U.S., the issue of police accountability has become very important to me. So it was from early discussions at libertarian conferences and meetings with people who already had great ideas about building similar apps that prompted me to think about building something similar and hopefully better. \u00a0\nDecentralized Security For All\nCT: Is there a typical user you had in mind? Is there one now?\nVV: A typical user would be an activist who is involved in street activism and had interactions with police on a regular basis, or a stay at home mom who wants to know when her children are being assaulted at school or even a group of neighborhood watchers who team up to essentially crowd-source the security and safety of their neighborhood. Everyone could be a typical user of Cell 411 because everyone is ultimately concerned with their personal safety or the well-being of their communities.\nCT: What made you decide to make it decentralized?\nVV: This is an interesting question because the word \"de-centralized\" can mean different things to different people. No, this is not an app that runs on any sort of \"blockchain\" type of infrastructure so from that perspective it is not decentralized, but it is a decentralized logical implementation of cells that are independently managed by users without any central oversight or control on their choices. This decision was made in order to allow users to manage their own lives and emergencies that may come their way without any oversight from some central authority. Users do not have to ask for permission in order to build their own independent cells and call upon each other for help, whatever type of help that may be.\nCT: Why haven't you made it open-source? Is this something you would consider down the road?\nVV: It's very simple: because I have a very clear vision of what this project should be and I want to see that vision through to the end. This is not an anti-police app or some social justice warrior project that will allow a limited number of nice activists to undermine the status quo. Instead, as ambitious as it sounds, this is a project that is aimed at solving the issue of safety in the lives of every human being out there, regardless of skin color, country or uniform they may be wearing. It is too early in the life of this project to even discuss open sourcing it, not only that, but the current architecture of the platform would make an open source fork difficult to implement due to dependencies we have in place with hosting and wireless providers.\n\nHelp not Undermine", "birthday": "2016-03-08T14:05:00+00:00", "date": "2016-03-08 14:05:00", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 8}

", "content": "Biometrics has firmly entrenched itself as one of the leading technological trends of the FinTech Industry in 2015. While Biometrics have been used for more than 15 years now, over the past 12 months there has become a far greater demand for them.\nThe market numbers speak for themselves - according to prognosis' from different sources, the size of the market is currently larger than 10 bln USD$, by 2020 this number will reach nearly\u00a024 billion USD$, growing at a CAGR of 17.9%. To add \u00a0on to this, an investigation by Goode Intelligence has shown, that\u00a0by 2017 more than a billion people will be using biometric authorization for their banking needs.\nA Replacement for PIN\nWhile mobile payments and online banking have firmly entrenched themselves in day to day life, the problem of personal information security on the internet has become exceptionally topical in recent days. It can't be said that the growth in interest is in anyway connected with radical innovation since biometrics has been actively used for more than 15 years now. However, \u00a0in the past year these technologies have become far more demanded. The results of\u00a0a vote carried out among the participants of the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas show that up to 28% of responders confirm that biometrics will have a huge impact on preventing theft in the system of online payments.\nThe secret reason for the popularity of the biometric authentication technology is quite simple. What are most popular methods of authentication nowadays? Passwords and PINs, which are, in a sense, precise sequences of symbols, generated by a system or a user. No matter how complex you make the system hackers and cyber-criminals will not be particularly stumped in breaking the code. Plus, there always exists the risk of simply forgetting or losing the password, especially if the password is particularly difficult.\nWhile Biometrical authentication is capable of completely solving these problems. The user will no longer be forced to come up with long passwords to remember. In a sense, now he or a part of him becomes the password.\nSimple Yet Secure\nThis system is both quick and comfortable. Instead of spending time typing in a sequence of numbers and symbols every time you want to access your information, you will have to spend no more than a few seconds making a small, simple gesture - such as putting your finger on a scanner - the authentication procedure will be completed.\nAlso it is considered very secure. It is self-evident, that biometric specifics, essentially being the physiological characteristics of an individual, are connected only to one particular user, and passing yourself off for someone else with these parameters becomes essentially impossible. These specifics are impossible (or at least, incredibly difficult) to mimic. Of course, some anomalies can happen, such as two people having nigh identical fingerprints, with minimal differences. However, the more biometric technology advances, the more sensitive it becomes to these differences.\nBlockchain Integration\nIt could be even more interesting to look at the possibilities of biometrics in the context of another major technology trend of the current day - the blockchain. This kind of correlation is no surprise - in the same vote put forth at the Money 20/20 conference, the Blockchain took a coveted third place. Many people are talking about biometrics nowadays - but far more are talking about the Blockchain. Both technologies are working in the same direction - securing the safety of monetary transactions in cyberspace. That is exactly why, the idea of combining these two technologies is hardly fringe.\nYou would think, that the merger of two reliable and promising technologies is capable of doubling the security of your personal information. However, as it often happens when discussing new technological trends, opinions tend to differ.\nOpinions Clash\nAndreas M. Antonopoulos, a world famous expert in Security Systems expressed his skepticism.\n\"I don't see any advantages in integrating biometrics into blockchains, directly. Perhaps if the biometric is a pre-image of a hash, then the risk isn't too great and it can be used later for verification. Otherwise, the public and transparent nature of blockchains makes the weaknesses of biometrics worse\"\u00a0- declared Antonopoulos.\nAccording to the expert, the weaknesses of biometrics lies in several aspects. First, it is rather easy to copy, which has been proven multiple times in the security industry. Second, having been stolen, they (who they?) cannot be changed, which makes biometrics only viable as a secondary form of authentication. Third, biometrics is vulnerable to a criminal applying hard force - for example, physically forcing a user to place his/her finger to a scanner. In such a situation biometrics cannot act as an independent security system, other layers are necessary.\nOn the other hand, there are other experts who look at the integration of biometrics in the blockchain purely from a positive standpoint. For example, Michel Chajes, a professional with a rich background in the sphere of Security and Biometrics.\n \"I think it's a good idea to combine the use of biometric templates and the strongly reliable way data are handled in Blockchain database as in the system developed to manage the cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, to develop a strong way to secure banking or financial transactions using own biometric data of the customer.\" \n\n-\u00a0Andreas M. Antonopoulos\nThe Founder\u2019s Argument\nJohann Caubergh, the head of\u00a0BioSSL and a veteran of the biometrics industry (with 15-years\u2019 experience), sees a major potential for the possibilities which biometrics unlocks for the blockchain. In his own words, the possibilities of biometrics can complement the blockchain, rid it of its current potential weak spots, and fortify the security of information from the side of the user.\n \u201cThe strength of the chain is measured by the weakest part. In blockchain it is the user himself. So the stronger the security is in the network and the blockchain is self-supporting security, the weaker it is for the user. By creating a biometric password, the user will be owner of his data\u2026 for life.\u201d \n\nA Contradiction\nTaking into account all these opinions, there seems some kind of contradiction. After all, biometric specifics are unique to each user, and as we have discussed, are tied to a particular individual. On the other hand, one of the advantages of the blockchain lies in its anonymity. What if the integration of biometrics within the blockchain completely invalidate this advantage?\nOnce again, opinions differ. Andreas Antonopoulos states:\n \"By embedding into a blockchain, the irrevocability of biometrics is added to the immutability of a blockchain which makes dealing with compromised biometrics even more difficult. While biometric registration may not reduce anonymity directly, it can be used to enhance statistical analysis of activity, so that the leak of a single identifier can destroy all privacy.\" \nOn the other hand, Michel Chajes once again presents an argument in defense of biometrics:\n \"Biometrics can be used to secure such transactions, only if the biometric data are anonymous, cannot be hacked without alarm, or accidentally or maliciously altered [\u2026] I do not see drawbacks of such a solution, besides it guarantees the anonymous side of the biometric templates of the user, there is no way to link his biometric data to his identity if he doesn\u2019t want it.\" \nAnonymity Remains", "birthday": "2016-03-02T15:04:00+00:00", "date": "2016-03-02 15:04:00", "year": 2016, "month": 3, "day": 2}

This directly supports the creator, and also allows users to see exclusive content. PopChest has had limited success, but recently, a YouTuber with 600,000 subscribers signed up for the service, creating a surge in interest.\nPopChest\nPopChest was founded on 7th May 2015 by Valerian Bennett and James Poole, with the intention of creating \u201ca blockchain-based media distribution platform that allows content creators to get paid directly, in real-time, for every video view\u201d and to give \u201can engaged audience the smoothest possible video-on-demand experience with no signups, no subscriptions, and no commitment.\u201d\nThe project launched a private beta that same month, and in June 2015, the general response from the content creator community was very much positive.

One of the main draws for content creators to the site is that, \u201cFor every 1 micropayment, [the content creator] generates the same revenue as 50 advertising-supported viewers.\u201d This is particularly important given the rise of ad-blocking software, as views on Youtube don\u2019t always translate to advertising revenue.\nBrian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, said this about PopChest on Twitter:\n Great proof of concept - bypass paywall in 5 seconds w/ bitcoin to play video.

Now, Wall of Coins\u2019 Robert Genito talks about how it is still possible today to exchange Bitcoins fast and without divulging private information.\nCointelegraph: Have you found potential Bitcoin users being turned off by the delay in purchasing or offloading Bitcoins through methods like exchanges?\nRobert Genito: Yes. The biggest turn off is how much information markets ask for buyers. Giving information is either inconvenient \u00a0(because the buyer has to take pictures and collect things), or they don't like the privacy infraction.\n\nCT: Does Wall of Coins have that same limitation?\nRG: No, because we operate differently.\nCT: How is that?\nRG: Let me make it easy for you: With Wall of Coins, the only requirement we always put on our buyers is the need for an SMS-compatible phone number, and this is to SMS text you the instructions to buy your Bitcoin. Should the buyer need help or phone our call center, Wall of Coins staff knows the authorized individual to discuss the order with by looking up the buyer\u2019s phone number. At the same time, we are absolutely compliant. We only ask for extra information when it is absolutely necessary.\nOther exchanges, such as Coinbase or Circle, need a lot of information from their users to mitigate risk created by the outdated electronic systems: bank account, credit cards, identification, etc. While many power users are fine and happy with this, the general public is not. In many cases, the general public does not even meet all of the requirements--such as having a bank account or credit card--and this shuts people out of obtaining bitcoin in the first place.\nCT: Before (or without knowledge of) Wall of Coins, how did most people tend to instantly and privately offload/buy Bitcoin?", "birthday": "2016-02-23T13:10:00+00:00", "date": "2016-02-23 13:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 23}

Variations exist and have been described as private and public blockchains depending on inherent properties. What is it that qualifies a blockchain as private or public, and how do they compare?\nDescriptions\nOleg Khovayko is a leading developer at Emercoin. He described public blockchains as any blockchain that possesses an equal availability to every participant within the blockchain. In other words, anyone can read, make transactions, and mine. This implies that every cryptocurrency blockchain is a public blockchain.\nWhile a private blockchain is any blockchain with certain restrictions. For example, mining is only available for \"selected miners\". Unfortunately, many people consider the term \"private blockchain\" to be very wide, even in the case of one node, where real mining does not exist. An example is a company known as Surety Technologies which keeps a system similar to a private blockchain for timestamps.\n\nLimitations\nAccording to Oleg, one crucial property of all private blockchains is that the owners are usually not able to prove the non-existence of \"hidden alternative blockchains\", which could prove to be a problem.

Thankfully the majority of the cost associated was picked up by the contest's sponsors and they too paid for graphics and promotional outreach in Bitcoin. Our top prizes for the contest was a total of 1.7 Bitcoin and one of the winners was brand new to the currency, it was fun to see someone get started by simply writing a great pro peace haiku. We regularly pay for services in Bitcoin, currently we are paying for graphic design services and some of our promotional products in Bitcoin.\n\nCT: Did you raise funds in Bitcoin, use it directly to finance activism, or both?\nAK: We certainly don't raise the majority of our funds in Bitcoin, but having accepted Bitcoin since November of 2012 we have seen a good amount come in over the years. We have had a few fairly large contributions come in this way but even when people send a small amount to our public address we get excited. We understand the long term possibility for the currency and understand the potential value people are sending our way.

He thinks that bitcoin is still evolving, but definitely heading somewhere. He said:\n \u201cWe have been running a local bitcoin exchange for exactly 4 years. During the first year, almost all of our customers were miners. In our second year (2013), some speculators appeared looking to take advantage of extreme price volatility. So, for the first 2 years, we had almost no customers who considered and used bitcoin as a currency. In the last 2 years the trend has slowly been changing. Mining became less profitable, price became more stable, so bitcoin generally became less interesting for miners and speculators. On the other hand, the number of our customers using bitcoin to buy something or for remittance has been increasing at slow and steady rate, and those are in fact the ones using bitcoin as a currency. To summarize, the data I have available implies that the public perception of bitcoin has been making a transition from a speculative commodity to a currency. I don't think that transition will ever be completed, since you will always be able to look at bitcoin both ways. It comes down to the question of how does the majority of the people use bitcoin? I think the answer is: as a currency. Even if that is not a correct answer at the moment, I am sure it will be in the couple of months or years.\u201d \nComplexity of cryptocurrency\nJani Valjavec is the Co Founder of Bitcoin payment processor, Cashila. Jani thinks Bitcoin is a more complex entity. In his words:\n \u201cBitcoin has properties of both currency and commodity. Plus some others. It's a totally new concept, so we can't really frame it into existing definitions. Harder question would be what is Ether. All that plus internal fuel? New world, new definitions.\u201d \nAlena Vranova is the Founder and Director at SatoshiLabs. She is also of the opinion that bitcoin is both a commodity and a currency, and even a bit more. She said:\n \u201cI think Bitcoin is both a commodity and a currency, and more than that. Bitcoin primarily is a platform that can be seen as a base for different applications. One of them is Bitcoin as money. Therefore is should always be regarded in the context instead of labelling it.\u201d \n\nConsidering a specific lawsuit where HashFast Technologies, a mining company sued to recover bitcoin paid to a physician for his promotional services, Alena believes it should be possible to have the disputes settled in Bitcoin, saying that for example, the Czech civil code says that the citizen can request settlement in money as well as replacement of the lost/damaged goods or returning the disputed value into the original state. However, with something fluctuating in price as much as Bitcoin does, this could be very dangerous, inviting many opportunists to seek unfair profits. She is also of the opinion that it should be made clear upfront, before entering any commercial relationship, on how eventual disputes or refunds will be handled.\nDual identity of Bitcoin\nMichael Vogel of Netcoins, a bitcoin ATM provider in Canada, thinks that bitcoin can be considered to be both a commodity and a currency. He said:\n \u201cMy opinion is that Bitcoin can be considered a commodity or currency, depending on the way it is used. Interestingly, the commodity value of Bitcoin is invariably tied to its value as a currency. From a regulatory point of view, the most important thing is that government agencies make a choice either way and officially legislate it. Government regulation around Bitcoin, although often perceived as a bad thing, actually helps bring clarity to businesses that might want to participate in Bitcoin, but are hesitant due to lack of legal clarity.\u201d \nJoel Cano is a FinTech, Blockchain and Bitcoin enlightenment expert. This is his opinion:\n \u201cIt depends where you are or what you are using it for. \u00a0In the case of EU is legally a currency, but for the CFTC in US is regulated as a commodity. \u00a0In the case of the Banco de Mexico (Central Bank) is considered a Digital Asset (commodity) but for the Intelligence Unit of the Tax Authority was recently considered a cash substitute for certain type of operations. \u00a0I believe Cryptocurrencies will make this concept to evolve and make the differences between commodity and currency to blurry in the near future.\u201d \nScott Bambacigno, VP WW Sales for AlphaPoint,\u00a0is a senior sales executive. Scott holds the opinion that bitcoin is both a commodity and a currency depending on application. He breaks it down like this:\n \u201cIt's both. And its context dependent. Currently it acts much more like a commodity because of the price fluctuations. As the depth of liquidity gets deeper it will take much more to make the price move and at that point it will act much more like a currency.\u00a0 Additionally, how people view and use it helps determine what it is. For those that are buying and holding believing the scarcity of bitcoin will cause a rise in value over time, bitcoin is more like a commodity. They are using bitcoin as a store of value relative to the product they traded it for. For those buying and sending/spending bitcoin it is a means of exchange and is being used as a currency.  If Bitcoin is used to pay a fee to store data in the blockchain then it's more like a currency.\u00a0 Intent, context and usage really help define what is Bitcoin. Another example of context determining what is a bitcoin is how it is traded on an exchange. If it's traded as a futures contract then it's a commodity and the CFTC has determined it's under their jurisdiction. I believe the IRS may have their own definition depending on context and usage.\u201d \nRoger Ver is known as the Bitcoin angel, investor and evangelist. He sums it up in one simple sentence:\n \u201cCurrencies originated from commodities, so Bitcoin is clearly both.\u201d \nAcademic view on Bitcoin\nGeorge Basiladze of Cryptopay had this to say:\n \u201cThat is too academic. Bitcoins is like gold. It is a commodity which can be used as a currency.\u201d \n\nRandy Brito is a Bitcoin enthusiast and founder of bitcoinvenezuala.com.

All Bitcoin transactions must be verified by miners, in a process called mining.\nThis process is done by a software that accesses the CPU\u2019s processing capacity to solve transaction-related algorithms. Originally, bitcoin mining was conducted on the CPUs of individual computers. Nowadays, to have enough processing power, that is done in big data centers.\nNot everyone can own a big data center, obviously, and that\u2019s why recently a new type of mining started to gain popularity, cloud mining.\nCloud mining allows users, instead of using their own machines, to buy mining power of the hardware placed in remote data centres. All bitcoin mining is done in the cloud, without any offline hassle, such as electricity, hosting issues, or installation and upkeep trouble.\nLow cost of entry and minimal risks\nCloud mining offers a mining system with a low cost of entry, minimal risks, and expenses, it is opposite to traditional models of mining that involve procurement, maintenance and configuration of highly specialized hardware.\nTraditional mining, in fact, needs \u201cto maintain the frequency of \u201cclosing\u201d blocks atten-minute mark. Increasing number of miners results in difficulty growth - the block is processed within 10 minutes; a number of miners decreases followed by the drop of difficulty and the close time of a block still takes 10 minutes\u201d, commented marketing expert at HashFlare Alexander Gromov.\nThe reasons for cloud mining being a current trend are many and we had the chance to find out more about them in a recent interview with Mr.Gromov:\n \u201cCloud mining allows to hire specialized equipments and a team of professionals to maintain them, so you are not limited by the capacity of a real miner; you can get your hashrate immediately, without any need to wait for delivery; you don\u2019t need to care about servicing of equipment and replacement of broken parts\u201d. \nHashFlare seems to be a simple way to earn bitcoins from cloud mining, as all you need to do is sign into the project, choose the hashrate according to the size of your investments, and pay for it by any means available. 24 hours later, you will receive and be able to withdraw the profit (the minimal amount is 0.0004 BTC, since the commission fee is 0.0003 BTC).\nHashFlare provides only two types of contracts currently: SHA-256 and Scrypt. So, how can bitcoin fans choose between them?\n\u201cThe first one is used for bitcoin mining, whereas the second one is used for Litecoin mining. It is difficult to tell which one of these contracts is more profitable since market prices are constantly changing. Expected time before payback is about 7 to 10 months, and thereafter the cloud will work exclusively for profit\u201d, answered Edgar Bers.\nStarting from February 16, HashFlare\u00a0has launched a preorder of ETHASH that is used to mine Ethereum. If you tune into the preorder before March 21, you will get a 12% discount.\n\nComparison with others\nCurrently there are a lot of cloud mining services so we decided to compare some of these platforms:\nGenesis Mining\nGenesis Mining is one of the most famous cloud mining providers around the world.", "birthday": "2016-02-26T12:40:00+00:00", "date": "2016-02-26 12:40:00", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 26}

The question is rather whether they see the opportunities as desirable from their perspectives. \nCT: Which steps must mobile operators take to begin utilising this new technology? \nD.S:\u00a0They will probably approach the Blockchain much like the financial service providers.\u00a0They will conduct internal investigations and build out proofs of concept (POC) around any ideas they come up with. They may partner with one or more specialists in the Blockchain industry to help. The probable first projects will be in the area of cost savings, possibly in billing and provisioning, possibly in identity management and KYC compliance. \nCT:\u00a0Since most governments now want to monitor mobile phones, could the Blockchain be advantageous to a customer who wants more privacy and security? \nD.S:\u00a0There are existing,\u00a0Blockchain-based secure messaging applications.\u00a0The time-sensitive nature of voice calls do not lend themselves well to Blockchain technology, but key/identity-management is perhaps an option. There are existing cryptographic privacy solutions like Silent Circle. \nCT: Are there any signs that the 5G network will be involved with the Blockchain? \nD.S:\u00a0Yes, the long term deployment of mesh networks may converge with 5G, but that is quite far in the future. \nNatural Evolution of the Sector \nCointelegraph sought the view of someone already in the telecommunications sector, so spoke to Lee Gibson Grant, an expert in telecommunications. \nCT: Are mobile operators in an ideal position to embrace \u00a0Blockchain technology? \nL.G: Mobile networks are already embracing the technology indirectly when you look at businesses such as Bitpesa and other remittance corridors.\u00a0They use Bitcoin converted into local mobile money services owned by networks such as Airtel Money, M-Pesa and MTN Money. \nCT:\u00a0Which steps must mobile operators take to begin utilising this new technology? \nL.G:\u00a0It would be a natural evolution by the telecoms sector when they find and define a relative use case to embrace Blockchain technology. \nCT: Since most governments now want to monitor mobile phones, could the Blockchain be advantageous to a customer who wants more privacy and security? \nL.G:\u00a0It's a very touchy subject and must be looked at in various ways.

Indeed, anonymity can be maintained by using various tools, but the protocol does not directly include this feature.\nIt is exactly this fact, in conjunction with the increased efforts by state regulators to try to regulate Bitcoin and bind it to their fanciful ideas, that has been inciting more and more crypto fans to look at other options.

Originally, appcoins were commonly associated with cryptoequity, but they have increasingly been designed to be essential to the use of new decentralized applications.\nCointelegraph had the opportunity to interview Mike Vine, Technology Evangelist for decentralized content distribution platform LBRY, on appcoins\u2019 increasing use beyond cryptoequity.\nCointelegraph: What is an appcoin?\nMike Vine: An appcoin is a cryptocurrency that is designed specifically to power a user application, rather than to just be a means of exchange and store of value. One of the beautiful aspects of private currencies (or private anything really) is that it doesn\u2019t have to be one-size-fits-all. We can have coins with attributes that work better for smart contracts and coins that work better for large transactions between banks and coins that work better for a hundred million people to each pay a penny to watch a music video.\nLBRY Credits (LBC), our built-in cryptocurrency, fit the definition perfectly.\nCT: How many other appcoins do you know of?\nMV:\u00a0Namecoin is a good early example. Ethereum is a kind of meta-appcoin, designed for facilitating various applications rather than just one. But LBRY has a chance of being the first to see mass adoption by the general public \u2013 surpassing even Bitcoin in number of users. Most people won\u2019t know or care that they\u2019re even using cryptocurrency. They\u2019ll just care about that song they want to download.\nCT: What made you decide to use an appcoin instead of Bitcoin or any other technology?\nMV: All of the LBRY founders are free-marketeers and Bitcoin advocates. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at get-rich-quick altcoin schemes since the early days. The market has shown that the bar is pretty high for what additional features will make an altcoin competitive with Bitcoin in the global currency horizontal market.\nEvery attempt was made to figure out how LBRY might be built on top of Bitcoin, but we eventually determined that doing so would be bad for Bitcoin and bad for LBRY. The LBRY blockchain stores particular data helpful for finding media, and it operates a naming system unlike anything available in existing cryptocoins. Names are subject to an ongoing bidding process to put into practice economic theories about efficient allocation of resources. In plain English, we hypothesize that there result of our protocol will be users being able to find the content they want simply by typing in a common sense term, like \u201cwonderfullife\u201d for the film It\u2019s A Wonderful Life. Bitcoin isn\u2019t built to allow for this naming system.\nAlso, LBRY will be processing oodles of micro-transactions. As the current block size debate has laid bare, Bitcoin is trending toward handling larger transactions. Perhaps Bitcoin core will adapt to handle endless micropayments, but if LBRY takes off, we certainly don\u2019t want to be the ones to overwhelm the BTC blockchain at this stage.\nFinally, we do plan to do a managed rollout of the protocol. In other words, we the founders are not simply going to release our system and hope that people adopt it. That\u2019s not how user applications traditionally succeed. In some ways, Satoshi set a deceptive precedent that you can just build something cool, release it, and let it take off. Of course, that\u2019s not even the real story of how Bitcoin got off the ground, but it does seem to be how other cryptoapp teams are approaching their product. At this stage, we view LBRY as a network app startup like Facebook was in its early days. It will be up to us to make the strategic decisions that see user adoption grow exponentially and make the network a viable competitor to centralized services like Netflix or iTunes.\nBitcoin will still be a payment option on the LBRY app, but it won\u2019t power the network.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/objections-to-accepting-bitcoin-according-to-businesses", "title": " Objections to Accepting Bitcoin, According to Businesses ", "content": "While Bitcoin transactions have seen a steady increase in recent years, it still remains far from a universally-accepted currency. For example, CoinMap\u2019s coverage of Phoenix, the 6th largest city in the United States with a population of almost 1.5 million, lists only a handful of business that accept Bitcoin, with a mere 33 in the greater metropolitan area of over 4 million inhabitants. Despite its efficiency of use and the ability to easily deal with price volatility, many businesses still express reservations about accepting Bitcoin.\nCointelegraph spoke with several businesses that give customers the option of paying in Bitcoin about complications that could arise and cause other businesses to avoid offering the same. We also spoke with a Bitcoin evangelist who has been instrumental in both convincing local businesses to accept Bitcoin as well as setting up Bitcoin ATMs or BTMs.\nWillingness to use Bitcoin not universal\nMark Warden, realtor and owner of Porcupine Real Estate, has had clients willing to buy with Bitcoin, but the desire was not reciprocated among all parties involved.\n \u201cI\u2019ve had one client that wanted to purchase a house with Bitcoin, but the seller wanted USD. My client had to liquidate the btc using Coinbase in order to consummate the transaction. I do have a client who will sell land in Grafton for Bitcoin if the right buyer comes along looking for that location.\u201d \nFor Seth Hipple, criminal defense attorney and partner at the Law Offices of Martin and Hipple, willingness to use Bitcoin wanes when faced with the additional effort required to make such a transaction.\n \u201cThe hoops I have to jump through to comply with the ethics rules mean that people generally prefer to pay me in [US dollars].\u201d \nBarriers to Bitcoin acceptance\nHipple would like to accept more business paid in Bitcoin, but several barriers exist because of the nature of his practice.\n \u201cFirst, I have to hold the Bitcoin separately in trust until the case is completed. This means that each client has to have their own unique wallet in which to hold the funds while waiting to earn them. Also, [the] client and I have to agree on a price for each Bitcoin. I charge an hourly rate, so we have to agree on a date to use as the valuation date. Otherwise, it just becomes unwieldy. We also have to agree on what will happen in the event of a refund.\u201d \nThese added complexities make most of Hipple\u2019s clients opt for more traditional methods of payment instead.\n \u201cUsually, when I start going through the Bitcoin addendum with the Client, they say they'll just pay in USD.\u201d \nWarden has similar complexities related to accepting Bitcoin for his real estate business, since the title company he works with is wary of price fluctuations during a pending sale.\n \u201cThe main concern on the title company\u2019s part is the danger of a rapid decline in the value of Bitcoin. This isn\u2019t a problem if the entire transaction is denominated in BTC, but if one party has BTC and the other wants USD, the title company is at risk of losing out if the value drops between time of deposit and the closing (usually a day or two later).\u201d \nIan Underwood, owner of firearms manufacturer Shaolin Rifleworks, said that his \u201cbiggest obstacle [to accepting Bitcoin] was finding a way to get our Wordpress/Wu Commerce site to accept it.\u201d\nIan Freeman, host of radio program Free Talk Live and prominent local Bitcoin advocate, confirms some of the concerns businesses have voiced regarding Bitcoin acceptance.", "birthday": "2016-02-09T17:08:00+00:00", "date": "2016-02-09 17:08:00", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 9}

", "content": "Thirty-six days have already passed since the new hard fork of Bitcoin, under the name Bitcoin Classic, came into being. The core developers believe that a hard fork is a last resort, something that you shouldn\u2019t do unless you have to.\nAccording to its website and this GitHub page, Bitcoin Classic is so far endorsed by a group of developers, namely Jonathan Toomim, Ahmed Bodiwala, Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, Peter Rizun, mining pools AntPool (24 percent of hash power) and BW Pool (6 percent of hash power), companies such as Coinbase, OKCoin, Bitstamp and many more.\nThe developers claim that miners and users will choose it because it intends to establish democratic decision-making on code changes, using miner and user input. To establish preference topics, Bitcoin Classic has collaborated with Consider.it. If a majority of both users and miners (the latter will need to provide proof they are indeed a miner) supports a change, it should be implemented. This reads in the form below on their website:\n \u201cWe are writing the software that miners and users say they want. We will make sure that it covers their needs, helps them deploy it, and gracefully upgrade the bitcoin network\u2019s capacity together.\u201d \nCointelegraph had the opportunity to interview the big players around the table. Our correspondent, Marinos Kokkinos, approached \u00a0Mr. Gavin Andresen, Mr. Harsh Patel, Mr. Allen Bunch, Mr. Gary Rowe and Twitter users, Mr. Jihan Wu and Mr. Nicolas Dorier.\nWhy miners and nodes will choose Bitcoin classic?\nGavin Andresen shared three reasons why he expects miners and nodes will choose Bitcoin classic:\n  \u201cKeep the system secure. Responding to security threats always was priority over anything else, because if the core technology of Bitcoin was insecure nobody would use it. Keep the system reliable. Reliability and security go hand-in-hand: if the system is unreliable then it doesn't matter if it is secure, nobody will use it. Add functionality to the low-level technology that makes Bitcoin better in some way-- more private or more usable or faster or that enables people to do something that they couldn't do before. But security and reliability always came first.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0  \nHarsh Patel said:\n \u201cI am of the opinion that public blockchains, semi-private / consortia chain and private / enterprise chains can co-exist as they have different objectives.\u201d \nJihan Wu said on his Twitter account:\n \u201cAntpool will start to test Classic soon. There is 7day long holidays ahead, so it's likely after the holidays. One node only first.\u201d \n\nHow does this affect Bitcoin\u2019s price and the fees of mining?\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nMr. Bunch, a software developer at Bank of America, said:\n \u201cMy personal view is that it is still early in the adoption of this technology. Still more changes to come.\u201d \nGary Rowe said:\n \u201cIt is likely that increased block size will permit more transactions per second which will increase the utility of the Bitcoin network which will in turn increase demand against a fixed supply. This will drive up the bitcoin price and more transactions mean more fees for miners.\u201d \nHow will this affect the multibit wallet?\nGary Rowe, speaking about this issue, said:\n \u201cWe will be mostly unaffected. To cope with situations where a fee market is developing we have provided the facility for users to increase their fee in advance of the initial broadcast (not through RBF). We may consider performing a fee lookup to warn users if they are in danger of generating a transaction that has too low a fee to be mined.\u201d ", "birthday": "2016-02-10T10:00:00+00:00", "date": "2016-02-10 10:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 10}

Of course, crypto knows no borders, and there has been lots of take up outside Scotland.

Iceland's experiment lost it's way because there were/are practically speaking hardly any places to actually use their coin. This is something we are determined to avoid, and have a heavy programme aimed at bringing users and takers of Scotcoin on board. For example, we have an ongoing roll out with pubs, clubs and restaurants as well as some fast food outlets. There will be a range of shops and sporting venues that will take Scotcoin, and we are looking in time for the Scotcoin economy to be in the $50-100 million area annually.

The revolution coming about as a result of the cryptocurrency startup, BitFinance, has become a subject of interest to one of the world's most respected institutions of research, Stanford University.\nBitFinance is not only revolutionizing the fragile Zimbabwean economy, but could also have an impact on the Bitcoin revolution in Africa as a whole.\nHere are some experts\u2019 opinions on the impact of the study on the Bitcoin ecosystem.\nTawanda Kembo is a Bitcoin evangelist and team member at BitFinance. Cointelegraph has asked him why he thinks Stanford University became interested in their company and what impact this is having on the company and the region as a whole. He said:\n \u201cI suppose Stanford found the whole idea of a multiple currency country and the prospect of using Bitcoin rather exciting and a worthwhile case to study for business students. More so the fact that a group of friends in a country down through an economic meltdown had woken up one day and decided to make a difference in their own country despite the reality of mammoth challenges. This has generated a feeling of awe, and has put our optimism on steroids. This is not the easiest of businesses to start and we feel uplifted, motivated and encouraged that we are doing something worth recognising. But most of all we are humbled that Stanford so it fit that our \u2018hustle\u2019 is study-worthy. And without doubt, publishing of the case is a lot of advertising, which would have cost the company good money to do, our story will definitely reach more audiences and hopefully done in this way it will be less of a task to be taken seriously. We are hopeful that the case will also raise interest among investors from all manner, because this is what we need to catapult ourselves to where we want to be.\u201d \n\nHope for more\nTim Frost is the Vice President of Marketing and Business at Wirex Limited, the owners of E-Coin. Tim believes that as more and more institutions dedicate research to evaluating the impact Bitcoin has in the developing world the better, saying that there are a lot of theories out there about the impact that Bitcoin can have in the developing world. He also feels that as more independent studies are performed, it will only become clearer where digital currencies are truly making an impact.\nAccording to Tim;\n \u201cAt E-Coin we feel the P2P infrastructure of Bitcoin is still very immature. As a company we have seen large growth in the handful of African countries we are able to ship to. We receive a lot of feedback that people are receiving Bitcoin as remittance, salary, and a number of different reasons. With their E-Coin card they are able to use their Bitcoin in everyday life. So our company experience is that digital currencies are having a significant positive impact in the developing world. Digital currencies may be the most misunderstood technology I have ever came across. As a technology there are many advantages to the legacy system but with research such as this and more, we expect the educational process to start to spread. We can only hope more case studies such as this will help shed a light on the positive attributes of blockchain based currencies.\u201d \nNational cryptocurrencies inevitable\nAnari Sangbe is the Co-Founder at ProducTank.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-bill-may-legalize-bitcoin-exchanges-in-wyoming", "title": " New Bill May Give a Green Light to Bitcoin Exchanges in Wyoming ", "content": "On 9th February, a group of Republican and Democrat representatives and senators, put forward a bill that may end the ban on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency exchanges in the US state of Wyoming.\nBitcoin Ban\nDespite the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate means of transaction and the increased usage of the cryptocurrency by businesses and customers alike, in Wyoming, as of mid-2014, nearly all trading of not only Bitcoin, but all cryptocurrencies, has almost completely ceased.\nThis is due to the Wyoming Money Transmitters Act that was introduced in Chapter 22 of Title 40 - Trade and Commerce, one of the Wyoming Statutes of 2011. Despite the act\u2019s introduction in 2011, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency exchanges only began to be affected in 2014/15 as the Wyoming Division of Banking communicated the regulatory policies\u2019 effects on cryptocurrency exchanges.\nCoinbase ceases operations\nOn 13th October 2015, Coinbase, one of the most popular Bitcoin exchanges in the US and the world, if not the most popular, released the following statement on its website, having already ceased operations in Wyoming in July 2014, saying that they were indefinitely suspending their business in Wyoming:\n \u201cAlthough we strive to provide continuous access to Coinbase services, Coinbase is indefinitely suspending its business in Wyoming.  The Wyoming Division of Banking has recently communicated regulatory policies which we believe will render continued Coinbase operations there impractical. In particular, we understand that the Wyoming Division of Banking interprets the Wyoming Money Transmitter Act to require licensure of entities which offer hosted bitcoin wallet services, and that as a condition of such licensure, licensees must maintain dedicated fiat currency reserves in amount equal to the aggregate face value of all bitcoin held on behalf of customers. Although Coinbase securely maintains 100% of all customer bitcoin, it is impractical, costly, and inefficient for us to establish a redundant reserve of fiat currency in equivalent value.  We understand this suspension will inconvenience our Wyoming customers and we apologize that we cannot currently project if or when our services may be restored.\u201d \n\nDespite the fact that Coinbase had already developed an insurance plan that would recover any lost or stolen coins that were in a user\u2019s online wallet, in the event that something unexpected happened, this did not satisfy the Wyoming Money Transmitters Act\u2019s requirement that exchanges had dedicated fiat currency reserves amounting to the value of Bitcoin held on their servers.\nCoinbase was forced to comply with these regulations most predominantly because of an obvious wish not to break the law, but it is important to keep in mind that Coinbase deliberately took a swift and strong stance in order to aid the legitimization efforts of the Bitcoin community. For digital currencies to be seen as a legitimate payment system, it is incredibly important that exchanges observe state and federal law strictly.\nOnly one exchange stays in business\nAlthough other exchanges were operating in Wyoming, Coinbase had the biggest share of the market by a fairly wide margin. However, as these other exchanges try to compete with Coinbase, they employ the same types of rules to legitimize their company, and as result, many more exchanges followed suit and ceased their operations in Wyoming, the most recent of which being a company similar to Coinbase, called Glidera.\nAs further competition between exchanges occurs, more and more of them will stop doing business in Wyoming. As of 13th February 2016, there is only one exchange company, that allows you to sell Bitcoin, still operating in Wyoming - an Australia-based company called Circle. However, it is likely that it will only be a matter of time before they stop doing business too.\nSolutions\nAlthough it is possible for Wyomingites to travel to Denver, Colorado to buy goods from the handful of merchants that accept Bitcoin there, this is obviously not the optimal solution.", "birthday": "2016-02-18T19:48:00+00:00", "date": "2016-02-18 19:48:00", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 18}

This was largely due to the presence in New Hampshire of the Free State Project, a political movement whose members tend to believe in decentralized and non-governmental forms of currency, making them very receptive to Bitcoin.\nBecause of New Hampshire\u2019s high concentration of tech-minded entrepreneurs, combined with its historically-high rating overall freedom ranking, the state has developed a robust Bitcoin ecosystem, allowing its residents to operate off of a 100%-cryptocurrency income.\nWorld\u2019s longest-running Bitcoin meetup\nManchester, New Hampshire is home to what its attendees claim to be the longest-running consecutive weekly Bitcoin meetup in the world. Zach Harvey, CEO and co-founder of BTM manufacturer Lamassu, founded the meetup with his brother and business partner Josh Harvey.\n \u201cMy brother started the Manchester Bitcoin Meetup in July 2012, right after the 2012 Porcfest which was a huge booster for Bitcoin. Porcfest 2012 was one of the first times many of us got to actually use Bitcoin to buy and trade on a daily basis. For Bitcoin enthusiasts, it was a move from talking about Bitcoin and theorizing to using it in practice. That's what led to having a weekly meeting, to experience using Bitcoin once a week. And of course talking about it as well.\u201d \n\nMatt Whitlock, longtime attendee of the weekly meetup, has been able to easily acquire or offload Bitcoin between private parties whenever desired.\n \u201cIt's very easy to trade Bitcoins at the meetups. There's always someone looking to buy or sell. Of course, depending on recent market price movements, finding someone willing to trade at spot may be more or less difficult.\u201d \nRent for Bitcoin\nMatthew Ping, owner of Ledgeview Commercial Properties, is one of the several property owners in the Manchester area that accepts Bitcoin for rent payments.\n \u201cTo my knowledge I'm the only property management company that accepts Bitcoin in New Hampshire. I know of a few property owners who rent out rooms and would accept Bitcoin.\u201d \nA resident of the Freecoast region (another name for New Hampshire\u2019s coast), Mike Vine, LBRY\u2019s technology evangelist, also runs a coworking and event space called the Praxeum, which accepts Bitcoin for membership dues.\n \u201cThere has been a lot of interest. Bitcoin is a very popular means of exchange in our Freecoast community\u2026 coworking is a natural market for Bitcoiners. Both communities tend to be tech-oriented, free-spirited, and avante-garde.\u201d \nBitcoin-friendly businesses of all types\nCoinmap.org lists more businesses accepting Bitcoin in New Hampshire than in Massachusetts immediately to the south, despite having less than one-fifth the population, and lacking a major metropolitan area like Boston.\nWithin 20 minutes drive of downtown Manchester, Bitcoin-accepting businesses include pubs\u00a0(including one of New Hampshire\u2019s top-rated establishments), a pizza restaurant, a chocolate shop, a barber shop, a construction company, and two\u00a0separate law offices. Elsewhere in the state, Bitcoin is accepted at a farm, a gas station, a silver mint, a news stand, and a firearms manufacturer. Finally, as has been publicized by Cointelegraph before, ride-sharing service Arcade City, which officially launched\u00a0earlier this month, allows drivers to accept Bitcoin payments.\nThe underground market\nUnique to New Hampshire\u2019s Bitcoin scene is the Community Market Day project, a decentralized marketplace featuring dozens of vendors, many of whom are clandestine. Jessica Love, the initiator of the project, also vends bulletproof coffee, receiving about one-third of her sales in Bitcoin.\n \u201cThe vendors may vary some but typically a [Community Market Day Manchester] event has at least 10 out of the 12 - 15 vendors accepting Bitcoin. There are [Community Market Day] event hubs being opened over the next few months in 3-4 different areas around the Free State on rotating weekends where more Bitcoin users will be attracted to vending.\u201d \nLove has seen all manner of goods and services being sold for Bitcoin at the various market days around the state.\n \u201cBut seriously, there are lots of products and services that you can pay for with Bitcoin at [Community Market Day] events. Farm meats, eggs, produce, honey, and such raised by friends and neighbors. Organic soaps, candles, coffee & tea, jewelry, crochet goods, household items, crafts, and more. Services too - massage, chiropractic care, and even hypnotherapy. \u00a0I believe that anything that can be brought to this market model and traded for Bitcoin should be. We are living the ultimate agorist experiment of an off the grid economy and beginning to implement the currency. I do see Bitcoin interest growing in the market. As more products become available in exchange for it, people seem happy to transfer more of their business to the new free market local economy that we are building here.

He emerges as a hero \u2014 tormented yet alive.\nIt might sound like an exaggerated comparison but Bitcoin has seen this same struggle. It had a wonderful year in 2015, with lots of investments and adoptions coming its way. In terms of trading, Bitcoin was named the most profitable investment of 2015 by many mainstream media outlets. However, 2016 has already more than made up for the lack of bad press that faced the digital currency in 2015. It has been associated with various nefarious deeds recently, which gave its critics an opportunity to bash its very existence.\nIt all started with a proposal to increase Bitcoin\u2019s scalability. Apparently, one of Bitcoin\u2019s leading developers, Mike Hearn, believed that the Bitcoin client - in its current format - was not able to handle an increased transaction volume. He therefore proposed to fork the client to increase the block size to 8MB from 1MB, to create a client which would be known as Bitcoin XT.\nHowever, the proposal had its own disadvantages. For instance, a catastrophic fork failure could bring Bitcoin to the verge of extinction. Other problems that could appear with the implementation of Bitcoin XT would promote centralization, increase mining expense and amplify orphan rates.\nThe vast majority of the Bitcoin community was therefore against the idea of forking.

Moreover, another camp emerged that sought to observe this \u2018civil war\u2019 within the Bitcoin community \u2014 a camp made up of a variety of banks and other traditional financial institutions.\nMike Hearn\u2019s Infamous Goodbye\nBitcoin\u2019s block size could have still reached a general agreement in a peaceful manner, but a public letter from Mike Hearn changed the entire scenario.

Many companies have built themselves a future in the economic sector with Bitcoin\u2019s technology, raising millions of dollars, having followed the age-old saying, \u201cIf you don't try it, how could you know it?\u201d.\nOur correspondent, Marinos Kokkinos, reached out to Mr. Kevin Barnes, the Chairman of Playcoin Entertainment Corporation, a Blockchain solution provider.\nHe has a clear view on the matter and said:\n \u201cAdopted like a commodity like gold, it will take time to prove itself. Adoption as a currency for transactions, it will have to be adopted by most all merchant processors like visa and mastercard. Just my opinion :)\u201d. \nMost of those in possession of Bitcoin are of this same mindset.\nRecently, it was announced that Bitstamp added a new option to all their user accounts - a new withdrawal option! You can convert USD to physical gold, and have it delivered to your door in a fully insured shipment.\nOn the same topic, our correspondent, Marinos Kokkinos, reached out to Mr. Tim Frost, VP of Marketing and Business Development at e-coin.\u00a0He is inspired by the Blockchain\u2019s decentralised technology. His company is dedicated to growing the popularity and usability of cryptocurrency, trying to make the transactions simple, safe and hassle-free. His view on the matter is:\n \u201cI feel it\u2019s still very difficult to buy, sell and acquire Bitcoin. I believe a larger percentage of the public is interested in having Bitcoin, but it\u2019s still difficult to acquire and use it. I believe companies such as ours who offer the ability to use Bitcoin anywhere with our E-Coin Bitcoin debit card is helping it become more practical and useful. As companies continue to merge the divide between traditional finance methods and Bitcoin adoption will increase. Until Bitcoin is widely accepted I believe we need to continue to build on existing infrastructures.\u201d \n", "birthday": "2016-02-03T18:14:00+00:00", "date": "2016-02-03 18:14:00", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 3}

Price uncertainty such as this poses a particular challenge to businesses depending on a reliable stream of income to operate.\nHowever, despite these major fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin, the total number of transactions has steadily been rising. Merchant service BitPay charted their transaction volume against the price of Bitcoin, and found their transactions were also steadily increasing regardless of price fluctuations.\nCointelegraph spoke to several business owners who accept Bitcoin, as well as a BitPay representative, about the effects of price fluctuations on business.\nPrice surges encouraging business to adopt Bitcoin\nAccording to Ian Underwood, owner of firearms manufacturer Shaolin Rifleworks (which uses Airbitz for transactions), their decision to accept Bitcoin can be traced to a price surge causing many potential customers to have disposable funds in cryptocurrency.\n \u201cWe decided to accept it because we make an expensive product, and there are people who have a lot of money available in Bitcoin, but not in cash.\u201d \nDealing with price fluctuations\nAdam VanLandingham, owner of construction company Auburn Contracting Services, LLC, does not have any business expenses payable in Bitcoin, however he says that price fluctuations are not a problem.\n \u201cUsing Bitpay it is not an issue because it transfers directly into [U.S. dollars] and deposits into our account. We do retain 10% savings, however it's not much.\u201d \nAttorney Brandon Ross, who also uses BitPay to convert directly into local currency, does have the option to use Bitcoin to pay certain expenses:\n \u201cThere are a few occasions where I've had an opportunity to pay directly with Bitcoin for a few vendors, typically technology purchases.\u201d \nHaving insulated his business from feeling the effects of fluctuations directly, Ross is not intimidated by changes in price long-term.\n \u201cI don't worry about the price fluctuations all that much. Some people are obsessed with them. But digital currency is in its infancy still. There's going to be fluctuation caused by several different factors. As the technology matures and if it receives wider adoption, it might even out.\u201d \n\nTrusting cryptocurrency as a payment method\nVanLandingham was first turned on to the idea of using Bitcoin after seeing it featured on a business television program.\n \u201cI had seen a report on [TV program hosted by John] Stossel in 2010. \u00a0I bought my first bitcoin for $29\u201d \nFor Ross, it took more exposure to feel comfortable with using Bitcoin for his business.\n \u201cI had several clients who were working with it. I knew about it long before I started using, but I really didn't \"trust\" it. I once had someone offer to pay on a $100 bill when Bitcoin was still like a quarter per. I declined.

Could Bitcoin and the Blockchain have saved the sector from this web within which it has been entangled?\nChanging monetary policies seem to have become a prevailing trend in the Nigerian financial services sector over the past few months. We have observed full-fledged bans on certain payment modes, several adjustments in the foreign currency regulations, partial lifting of bans, introduction of new financial transaction systems and several other counter-policies all within a space of six months, such that the rate of change has become a matter of utmost concern to investors within the country.\nFor a nation that is predominantly import-dependent, FOREX policies will always have a huge impact on the economy. Both the large and medium scale investors have been rattled by the hectic rate of change in policies witnessed within the very recent past, the latest of which being the approval of transfers from the domiciliary accounts of customers of commercial banks. One of such emails sent by Guaranty Trust Bank to its customers reads as follows:\n \u201cWe are pleased to inform you that you can now transfer Foreign Currency Cash deposits made into your GTBank domiciliary account(s) via Internet Banking, Mobile App or at any of our branches nationwide, subject to a daily cumulative limit of $10,000. Thank you for banking with us.\u201d \nMixed Feeling\nThere seems to be a sigh of relief with this development as investors see it as a process that will bring back the missing flexibility in their ways of carrying out transactions, even though some are still skeptical about it, due to the frequency of the change of policies lately.\nHetty Hembadoon Orkuma is a bookseller and the Managing Director of Coffee Coloured Books. She is yet to be convinced that all is well. Asked about her perception on the recent development, she says:\n \u201cI am skeptical right now. These policies are coming too fast and do not make much sense to me. For now I think my forex is safer in my wallet, even if that makes it harder to use, I feel safer.\u201d \nDissecting the situation\nBabatunde Ajayi is the Team Lead, Corporate Finance at Investment One Financial Services Limited. He took his time to give a breakdown of how the Central Bank of Nigeria has got itself into what he refers to as \u2018a mess\u2019.\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Babatunde says:\n \u201cIn the first instance, the problem started when CBN stopped the banks from transferring US Dollars deposited in cash to accounts outside the country. At the time, CBN said they were trying to minimise or stop money laundering. However, the widespread effect was that banks piled up huge stocks of dollars in their vaults, but couldn\u2019t transfer same out.\u201d \n\n\u201cSo the banks asked customers to stop bringing FX in cash, since they couldn\u2019t do much with the cash,\u201d explained Babatunde. \u201cSo the cash and transfer markets for FX were effectively separated. If you had USD cash, it had to stay as cash. If you had USD transferred into your account, it was more valuable.\"\nHe continued:\n \u201cBecause the bulk of demand for USD is for those who need USD for imports, which means they need to transfer it outside the country. So we had one exchange rate for cash, and another for transfers. Recipe for disaster!\u201d \nBabatunde explained that Nigerians would open accounts in Ghana or the Republic of Benin, deposit cash there and then transfer out. The policy made no sense from day one.\nIn creating markets, you should ensure that there is little or no variation in the price of a similar/identical commodity. If not, you will create scarcity and/or opportunities to buy in one market and sell in the other.\nSo you remember that stock of dollars in the bank vault? It got finished. By December 2015, folks who had deposited very small amounts of FX couldn\u2019t withdraw from the banks. The banks had no pounds, dollars, Euros, nothing. Everything ran out, and of course, everybody had stopped giving them cash, so there was no new supply.\nThe reversal of the policy was borne out of necessity, because in devising its policies, the CBN had effectively denied the entire system of dollars and they needed to quickly re-inject liquidity but unfortunately, I'm not sure the policy has had the desired effect so far. I mean the new policy.\nBabatunde said:", "birthday": "2016-02-03T10:34:00+00:00", "date": "2016-02-03 10:34:00", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 3}

", "content": "With the falling oil price and a national budget predominantly denominated on borrowed funds, the Nigerian naira looks to be set to lose more value in the international currency market. Will citizens turn to superior currencies as a safe haven for their wealth? Will Bitcoin make a sweep into the Nigerian market?\nThe Nigerian economy has been compared to that of Venezuela as both nations have, for the past couple of decades, generated a major part of their revenue from oil exports.\nWhile the oil boom was in full swing, both Venezuela and Nigeria failed to invest in their futures by developing their oil infrastructure and diversifying their respective economies. With global oil prices collapsing, the nation of Nigeria finds itself in trouble as it struggles to find an alternative source of revenue to fund its national budget. In an attempt to address this issue, Nigerians have seen an influx of internal policies, indirectly taxing citizens of the country through the introduction of a number of bank charges and other institutional charges for services within the country. However, these small fees barely make a dent in, let alone eliminate, the huge deficit of about $11Billion reflected in Nigeria\u2019s 2016 National Budget.\nOpinions have emerged on what the response of the Nigerian public will be as several indicators point towards further depreciation of the national currency.\nA major problem has been created\nAlthough the Nigerian President has insisted that he would not move to officially devalue the naira, something he reaffirmed when he met with Nigerians living in Kenya during his last visit, his statement has been criticised in some circles. Prominent among his critics is Pat Utomi, a renowned Nigerian professor of political economy and a management expert. He is also a Fellow of the Institute of Management Consultants of Nigeria. Prof. Utomi said that the President had created a major problem for the Nigerian economy by making that statement. In his words,\n \u201cSomebody like him should not be talking about such things, keep quiet let people who talk about them, whatever your sentiments are talk about them, otherwise you create a problem [sic].\u201d \n\n-\u00a0Pat Utomi, Nigerian professor of political economy and a management expert.\nHe concluded by saying that the country did not take advantage of the windfall by diversifying its economy when oil prices were high, despite knowing how volatile the price of oil can be.\nIs there a patriotic will?\nEkene Isiuwe, an ex-banker with Investment One Financial Services Limited holds a similar opinion to that of Prof. Utomi. According to Ekene:\n \u201cSeveral governments have spoken extensively on other income heads that could supplement the income loss from falling prices in crude oil, but implementation has been lacking.\u201d \nEkene says that for the naira to survive, the citizens of Nigeria must take up the patriotic responsibility of avoiding the rush of trying to secure their personal wealth, by storing them in superior currencies, so that the demand for the naira can still be reasonably sustainable. However, he does concede that such patriotism might just be too much to ask from a people whose wealth matters so much to them.\nThe naira is dead\nAmang Saliyuk, an SEO Consultant and blogger, was particularly blunt about the matter, and very straightforward in his assertion, saying:\n \u201cWhen Mao Tse-tung took over in China the first thing he did was to force everyone to the farms, he made sure the country had enough before they even talked about exports he ensured that internal capacity was developed. When they fully developed the capacity to feed themselves and were also able to produce their daily needs without imports they started exporting. Farming for now is our only way out. Create an almost closed economy, make sure our fiscal and monetary policies are in tandem. The truth is that the naira is dead and our government knows it. The President is just scared of the backlash that is why the naira hasn't been devalued yet.\u201d \nThe boat has sailed already\nThere is usually a prevailing trend which occurs within most developing nations at the sight of a falling local currency. Citizens and institutions very often tend to store their wealth in superior currencies and in locations far from their immediate economic environment. This phenomenon has already began to unfold within the Nigerian system.", "birthday": "2016-02-04T18:15:00+00:00", "date": "2016-02-04 18:15:00", "year": 2016, "month": 2, "day": 4}

With an inflation of 275% in 2015, and IMF forecast of a far worse situation in 2016 as the nation struggles to find stability in it\u2019s economy. Can Bitcoin play any role at all? If so, how big a role can the Cryptocurrency play in the given situation?\nVenezuela has been in the news lately, but not for very positive reasons. The country faces severe social and economic problems, such as high inflation (the highest in the world), shortage of basic goods in the markets, high criminality and media censorship. With the nation\u2019s currency highly devalued in the parallel market, its citizen are turning to other currencies for financial safety albeit in both the right and the wrong ways.\nCointelegraph caught up with the Randy Brito, Founder of BitcoinVenezuela.com, a non-profit bitcoin information site that has carried the responsibility of not just creating bitcoin awareness in Venezuela, but also in educating citizens on the fundamentals and inherent values of the cryptocurrency.\nThere is no resistance\nRandy believes that Bitcoin can become a genuine saviour of the Venezuelan economy for a number of reasons.\nLike several other governments across the globe, the Venezuelan government has not come out clearly to either adopt or prohibit the use of bitcoin, Randy acknowledges this fact and goes on to add that the government\u2019s posture speaks of a silent approval. He believes this is because the government censors negative statements towards bitcoin, and because a reasonable number of those in government and their relations use Bitcoin. For example, Guido Ochoa (jnr), who happens to be the \u00a0son of a member of parliament, bought out the Bitcoin mining company Hashfast after it declared bankruptcy in the United States.\nAnother thing that has encouraged government tolerance of bitcoin is that most Venezuelan government officials prefer to conceal their wealth, and the semi-anonymous nature of bitcoin suits them very well.\nBitcoin as a viable replacement\nRandy says that he hopes that Bitcoin will replace the long running demand for foreign currencies like the US dollar, due to the loss of value of the Venezuelan Bolivar, for people seeking a safe haven for their wealth. Randy says:\n \u201cThe people need to know that Bitcoin can be better and more flexible and a good way to store wealth. The only problem with the Bitcoin is that it is not very liquid, as transactions are usually irreversible. That notwithstanding, Bitcoin can be informally accepted as it is not prohibited in Venezuela, just like the dollar credit cards received by merchants, the bitcoin can be received also and used even for international purposes.\u201d \nRandy also noted that the majority of bitcoin users within the country at the moment employ such service as a means to move their money out of the country.\n\nNo exchanges, no problem\nOn some of the hitches that Bitcoin has experienced so far in Venezuela, Randy points out the lack of exchanges, stating that there is only one registered bitcoin exchange within the country, Surbitcoin. This is likely due to the absence of modern technology within the nation\u2019s banking sector. Problems with obsolete banking infrastructure leave Venezuela\u2019s finance sector well exposed to fraud, problems which are often exacerbated by industry insiders.\nThe absence of local exchanges has not stopped the growth of the bitcoin market in Venezuela. In Randy\u2019s words:\n \u201cThe Bitcoin market in Venezuela is indeed big and growing at a fast rate. The absence of exchanges have seemingly gone unnoticed as most bitcoin miners within the country trade informally with people they can trust, basically for reasons of privacy, as they seek to conceal their source of wealth from the public.\u201d \nBitcoin will empower the people\nRandy insists that the Bitcoin intervention could be the \u2018bailout\u2019 that the Venezuelan economy has long waited for.\nHe says that the transparent nature of the bitcoin blockchain transactions has the power and appeal to draw huge volume out of the currency black market, which will eventually cause a ripple effect within other aspects of the currency and products market.

He said that while many governments may have ruled virtual currencies out because of their possible use in illegal activities, virtual currencies are more secure in many ways than paper value; the negatives of virtual currencies being much weaker than the use of cash.\nHe also added that the EU could learn lessons from how Britain has maintained lower regulatory requirements for peer-to-peer lending, enabling the fledgling sector to innovate and grow much faster than in the rest of Europe.\nSian Jones, founder of EDCAB\u00a0said:\n \u201cBlockchain delivers trust in an otherwise trustless realm.

IOTA is a micro-transaction crypto-token that will facilitate the architecture involved with IoT. The IOTA protocol runs off of Tangle, which has similar functionality to a blockchain yet acts more like an emulated version, giving it more versatility.\nIOTA tokens will be available for testing by a limited number of users outside the company starting early February, said its co-founder David S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8.\nDavid S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8 had earlier talked to Cointelegraph in October 2015 after the release of IOTA. We catch up with David again, to hear more about the beta version that is about to launch.\nCointelegraph: Since you last interviewed for us, what is new with IOTA?\nDavid S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8: We have raised almost half million dollars from the community and been accepted into the Wanxiang Blockchain Labs grant.\nCT: What features will you be testing in the BETA version?\nDS: Data and Transaction transfers. IOTA is all about data transport layer and transactions.\nCT: Would you like to elaborate on the underlying technology of \u00a0the IOTA beta version?\nDS:\u00a0IOTA is the first blockless cryptographic token, that is instead of a regular blockchain we created something brand new called a Tangle which is based on a Directed Acyclic Graph structure. This enables further decentralization of the network and also greatly enhances the scalability. There are no fees in IOTA which makes it optimal for real-time compensation. This creates opportunities where for instance a sensor that is gathering data pays a processing station nearby to process said data in real time. Another example that is easy to grasp is the sharing economy of electric bikes, with IOTA you can pay for EXACTLY how much you use the bike, no more and no less, in real time. But the same technology is also perfectly suited outside of IoT for any kind of services that require real-time compensation. An example would be music streaming where you wouldn't pay a subscription, but rather real time for the exact amount you listen to, or e-Books where you'd pay per page etc.\n\nCT: In the earlier interview, you had said that you were speaking with people from Ethereum, Bitshares, Nxt, and Bitcoiner about overlap and how the different technologies can work together in synergy.

Tell them how the system works, what are the pros and cons of using bitcoin, and also the risk of owning bitcoins. There is a lack of information material about Bitcoin in Azerbaijani language, and we are planning to focus on this issue by translating and issuing accurate information for local people.

In 2015, the bill was tabled to be voted on at a later date so it could be further studied.\nCointelegraph spoke to four of the legislators supporting the measure (and who have been active in pushing for pro-Bitcoin legislation over the years), three of whom served as co-sponsors: Representative Eric Schleien (the bill\u2019s primary sponsor), Representative Keith Ammon, Representative James Spillane, and former Representative George Lambert.\nLegislators\u2019 introduction to Bitcoin\nRep. Schleien and Rep. Spillane (who accepted Bitcoin donations for his election campaign) first read about Bitcoin online somewhere they couldn\u2019t recall. George Lambert, who is now an avid Bitcoin user, first heard about it at the Porcupine Freedom Festival, an annual festival held in New Hampshire by the Free State Project.\n \u201cI sold webhosting for Bitcoin when BTC was around $3. So I was getting 5 BTC/ month.\u201d \n\nRep. Ammon, also an avid user who has been buying Bitcoin since the only way to do so was through an Internet Relay Chat (before the launch of any of the early exchanges), heard about Bitcoin at another Free State Project-sponsored event, the annual Liberty Forum conference, initially through a side discussion about RipplePay, the precursor to the modern Ripple network.\n\u201cBack then, RipplePay was a centralized network that basically kept track of IOUs between people. I didn\u2019t get it. Couldn\u2019t understand it. It just seemed too easy to scam the system. So I kept up with some of the other participants in the room, continuing the discussion as we saw each other later at various gatherings. [Mathematics professor and early Bitcoin adopter] Darren Tapp was one of the participants and eventually he heard about Bitcoin and introduced me to it in one of our discussions. I did some investigation into it, and the light went off. It made total sense, and I\u2019ve been a Bitcoin enthusiast ever since.\u201d\n\nAttempt to require New Hampshire\u2019s government to accept Bitcoin\nRep. Schleien created HB552 to allow the state of NH to accept payment of taxes and fees in bitcoin through the use of a third party payment processor, calling it:\n \u201c...simply a more secure and cheaper alternative for taxpayers than using a credit card and wouldn't cost the state any money. The state isn't allowed to work with a company that would cost them money because I created that constraint in the bill.\u201d \nRep. Spillane, in addition to co-sponsoring the legislation, also helped organize the debate before the vote. Lambert, in addition to proposing multiple Bitcoin-related bills during his term as State Representative, has testified in favor of similar legislation after leaving office, including HB552. Rep. Ammon co-sponsored the bill and testified to the committee on its merits, but admits he \u201cdidn\u2019t do too much heavy lifting trying to get it to pass.\u201d\n\n \u201cIt was mostly a symbolic bill. I didn\u2019t anticipate too many people paying the state in bitcoin. But it would have sent a message to entrepreneurs in other parts of the country that New Hampshire was a technologically progressive state.\u201d \nWidespread Bitcoin ignorance in the legislature\nLambert estimates only 40-60 of the 400 members of the New Hampshire House of Representatives understand Bitcoin. Rep. Spillane gave a similar estimate of 75, though he suggested that, after the testimony surrounding HB552, around 60% (or 240 members) would at least recognize the term. Rep. Ammon concurred, but added:\n \u201c...many still think it\u2019s magic Internet money and don\u2019t understand the concepts behind it. It was kind of funny watching some of the older representatives trying to wrap their heads around it. Humans definitely have a universal facial expression for when they\u2019re confused.\u201d \n\nBarriers to Bitcoin adoption\nRep. Spillane considers the inability of many legislators to understand Bitcoin to be a significant barrier to adoption.\n \u201cWe still can't accept credit cards in the secretary of state business office for crying out loud.\u201d ", "birthday": "2016-01-27T15:40:00+00:00", "date": "2016-01-27 15:40:00", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 27}

Now Litecoin has an opportunity to reach $3.30.\nLTC:BTC exchange rates are again at 0.08. Moreover, Bitcoin price also notably fell last night. Thus Litecoin moved to today's $3.10.

It says their service could benefit from Bitcoin\u201d, said JP Buntix to Cointelegraph.\n\nNevertheless, some may have quite the opposite opinion about JP\u2019s article.\u00a0George Gor, the Editor-in-Chief and Head of Editorial at Cointelegraph, stated:\n \u201cMany authors are trying to advise big companies what to do just to make their text more SEO-friendly and to add the \u201cBitcoin\u201d word into the text. Too bad that journalism turns into graphomania with bloggers attempting to attract readers with factless texts. Authors just add the word \u201cBitcoin\u201d into a headline and wait until it brings them 1,000,000 views from people searching Bitcoin in Google\u201d. \nHype Articles\nBe that as it may, there\u2019s nothing criminal in expressing opinions. At least, JP\u2019s article reflects his own opinion, written with his own words. Is it really newsworthy? Perhaps, the readers will answer the question for themselves. Bas Wisselink, co-founder of NXT Foundation stated:\n \u201cIf this article by JBP actually had stated that EA was going to do this, then it would not only be ethically suspect, but wrong. However, there is nothing in the article that states this. The article clearly is only saying that it bitcoin would be good to use for such a service. That is its message. The article is an opinion piece and it is clear to me it is nothing more than that\u201d. \n\nGeorge Papageorgiou, a member of Bitcoin experts team at the University of Nicosia, Greece, seems to agree with this:\n \u201cAnyone who thinks they discover some new use case for a business using bitcoin, is free to write about it, yes. Is this newsworthy ? I don't know. This is not Buzzfeed-level click-baiting though\u201d. \nInternet marketing consultant and Bitcoin enthusiast, Adam Guerbuez, thinks there\u2019s \u201cnothing new in websites, mainstream and blogs alike using carefully targeted keywords in their content to manipulate search result position for their content\u201d. He also distinguishes the so-called hype articles, which \u201care less keyword rich and more packed with a type of hidden sales pitch, to sway public opinion\u201d. He stated to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cThe effectiveness of such articles depend on two key factors being syndication and just how convincing the article is. I see no harm in such hype articles since they are a key element when it comes to internet marketing with an end goal in place\u201d. \nHe also thinks JP\u2019s article to be a good example of such hype article.\nStop Copypasting and Unverified Facts", "birthday": "2016-01-25T09:50:00+00:00", "date": "2016-01-25 09:50:00", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 25}

Descent from the level of $3.20 could be fast or painfully slow \u2014 everything depends on the behavior of the \u201celder brother\" Bitcoin. Only sudden growth of Bitcoin can bring Litecoin to the levels of $ $3.50, 3.80 and above.\nIf Bitcoin continues to fall, this week we will see a Litecoin price below $3.00.

Today's movement is a correction after falling to 0.009.\nThus on the graphics of DASH\u2019s price for a week the falling trend is clearly visible. Falling continuation that will give traders an opportunity to place buy orders at the price of 0.0075 and below is most probable.\nETH\n\nETH grew sensationally this week. ETH practically caught up with Ripple by the capitalization volume and now it has every chance to surpass Litecoin.\nThe repeated test of the level of 0.04 turned into its breaking through. Then practically without stop the course overcame the level of 0.05.\nTrading volumes grow every day, and the recent top of the price almost reached 0.058. But the figure of the technical analysis \"flag\" specifies that the holiday for ETH comes to an end, and a falling of this cryptocurrency could be just as impressive as its growth.

It's simply just about a rule definition under which a payment should be released. For example you can hire someone looking after SEO. You'll make an agreement he will get your webpage to a certain position in web-browsers. The payment is automatically released only if the agreed position would be reached.

The WEF annual conference this year was mostly dedicated to the Fourth Industrial Revolution and FinTech.\nThe World\u2019s financial and banking giants again shared their attitude to digital currencies and Blockchain technology. Some of them did note that new distributed ledger solutions will change the financial industry soon, while others condemned Bitcoin to failure.\nMasterCard investments\nAfter the first day of the conference an interview with Garry Lyons, Chief Innovation Officer at MasterCard, to Business Insider caught everyone\u2019s attention. He said that the company is \u201cinterested in seeing where blockchain technology goes\u201d and the company is already investing in\u00a0Digital Currency Group (DCG), the Bitcoin and Blockchain company.\nGarry Lyons\u00a0continued:\n \u201cIt\u2019s not just the industry that\u2019s excited about blockchain \u2014 it\u2019s the world, everyone. Even at Davos, every single tech panel I have gone to mentions blockchain and some people call it \u2018the second coming.\u2019 But while we think it\u2019s very interesting, we don\u2019t want to, and no one wants to, be blindsided by rushing into it [as the technology is still developing].\u201d \n\nR3 Consortium followers\nSince the rise of Bitcoin at the end of 2014, the banking industry feels the pressure of losing power over the financial world and society for centuries. Now banks are trying to get on the train of the booming fintech market. No doubt, that representatives of the banks that participate in R3 consortium would use quite similar statements, while making bets on their research of distributed ledgers and not Bitcoin. Here are some of the statements:\nWillem Buiter, chief economist at Citi\u00a0said:\n \u201cWe know that bitcoin itself is a complete failure and shows the number one law of programming and software: that anything that can be programmed can be hacked. So nothing is completely secure.\u201d \nJames Gorman, the chairman and CEO of Morgan Stanley\u00a0stated:\n \"It's not going to change everyone's life tomorrow.\" \nJohn Cryan, co-chief executive of Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, also mentioned the interest in Blockchain, rather than Bitcoin:\n \"Blockchain technology is interesting. Bitcoin, I don't think is.\" \nIMF is still concerned about virtual currencies\nDuring the conference the latest paper on virtual currencies was released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Christine Lagarde, the Managing Director of IMF,\u00a0cited it at the WEF on Wednesday:\n \u201cVirtual currencies (VCs) and especially their underlying technologies are a potentially important advance for the financial sector that could increase efficiency and financial inclusion, but can also serve as vehicles for money laundering, terrorism financing, and tax evasion.\u201d \n\nGame changing plans\nSwitzerland is the country with the most developed financial industry and most trusted banks in the world. The main conferences, like World Economic Forum also takes place exactly here in Davos. Possibly a new game changing innovation in the banking industry will come from Switzerland as well.\nThe swiss news and information platform\u00a0swissinfo.ch took an interview with Guido Rudolphi, who plans to create the world\u2019s first Bitcoin bank in Switzerland. He expressed much more optimistic statements about the future of Bitcoin. He told us:\n \u201cI am not for one second concerned for bitcoin. It is not doomed.

", "content": "Democracy of self expression could ruin copyright\nNowadays the market for art is increasing its power thanks to social networks and platforms that allow anyone to express and publish their artistic creations on the web.\nOmitting the fact that we cannot always define those creations as ART, the democracy of self expression is growing up.\nBut on the other hand - with this system, on the web - anyone can save or copy content, cheating the real author.\nThe choice is yours\nYou are surfing on Instagram and you see a very beautiful pic of the sunset.\nYou can share it with the name of the real author OR you can take a screenshot, cut the signature and pretend it is yours.\nThe choice is yours.\nWhat\u2019s the solution?\nTo solve this problem there is the Blockchain, a digital archive where everything can be stored and it could be used to track and verify ownership through something like contracts.\n\u201cThe blockchain allows a seal of authenticity on transactions. This means a potential replacement of existing payment systems as money and credit cards, but also a revolution for all those entities that provide centralized transactions, such as notaries, banks, public records and governments too\u201d, said SiamoSoci CEO and BlockchainLab member Dario Giudici.\n\nThought about in this way, the blockchain could be the answer to one of the most important problems in the art market: authenticity and copyright.\nIn fact blockchain technology promises to unleash more value in the art market by extending provenance and security.\n\u201cArtists, especially new artists that work in digital, will need the blockchain more and more to monetize their work in various ways. As the saying goes, the Internet is the biggest Xerox machine on earth and rights management is key to sustaining creative output. One company doing this pretty well is Monegraph in New York City. They are leveraging the Blockchain's functionality to execute contracts, payments, rights retention and even paid distribution discreetly, indelibly, and securely.\nAs far as galleries go, we're still working out how the Blockchain can be helpful to them. Clearly there are basic applications such as title and ownership but I think the traction in that will come perhaps not from the galleries themselves but from the peripheral and support businesses such as title insurance, ownership for financing purposes, and the like. Even as I say this I know that these particular cases are the just the beginning of the unbundling of value in the art space\u201d, said Agentic Group Founder & Managing Director Rik Willard.\nSo, what if Instagram used the Blockchain?\nA photographer can have information about his photos, knowing where and when they have been published all around the net.\nThis is a precious service, because daily anyone can simply save a picture or copy an article and sign it with their name: a serious copyright infringement at this point.\nMaybe Instagram will consider using the blockchain to create a more trusted and more monetizable industry.\n\u201cIt would be a major value add for their vast store of graphic arts and photos. It would open up exciting new revenue streams for them and would completely revolutionize -- and probably save -- their business\u201d, commented Rik Willard.\nCoinTemporary\nValentine Ruhry and Andy Boot created Cointemporary, a digital gallery that exhibits online artworks by contemporary artists from all over the world.\nCointemporary displays one piece of art at a time for ten days each or until it is purchased. Also they decided to sell these pieces of art online accepting bitcoin as the only method of payment and all the artworks purchased will be entered into the Blockchain through Ascribe.\nAscribe", "birthday": "2016-01-25T12:00:00+00:00", "date": "2016-01-25 12:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 25}

Are there ways to ultimately prevent one\u2019s wallet from being hacked? Is there any way of recovering stolen funds from a hacked wallet? Are exchanges obliged to refund Bitcoins stolen from a virtual wallet?\nEvery hoster of virtual wallets and exchanges will always inform wallet owners of the importance of employing sometimes very basic, and at other times a bit more sophisticated measures in safeguarding their wealth. These hosts and exchanges basically provide the avenues and systems of enhancing the security of Bitcoin wallets, yet the buck stops with wallet owners to ensure that their wallets are secure, at least most of the time.\nNevertheless, due to one reason or another, certain individuals may have the security of their wallets breached, some people have even had some or all of their wealth stolen. Most people who have been in such a situation have barely known what next to do. Which gives rise to the question:\nWhat do you do when your wallet is hacked?\nA product manager of a hardware wallet who prefers to remain anonymous in responding to the above question says:\n \u201cWell, if a user\u2019s account and password got hacked and he/she did not have \u2018two factor authentication\u2019, then he/she does not have a strong position to talk to his/her exchange but I think such a user could at least try to do the blockchain analysis\u201d \nThe source continued by saying that such analysis would reveal if the hacked coins passed through a certain exchange, at which point the user can make a report to the police, knowing that most exchanges do comply with authorities.\nIn conclusion, our source said:\n \u201cHacking is a criminal offence in most jurisdictions, so I guess if any user\u2019s computer or account got compromised, such a user could report to police.\u201d \nWhat are the chances of getting your stolen Bitcoins back?\nRoman Mandeleil is the CEO and founder of ether.camp.\u00a0Roman states that in the history of Bitcoin, 99% of stolen coins were never returned, saying that the bulk of the responsibility of keeping one\u2019s wealth secure lies in the hands of the wallet owner.\nAsked about what necessary steps users should take to ensure the safety of their wealth, he responded as follows:\n \u201cDon't give your private key to anybody nor website or a person, keep it encrypted on your personal domain that would be secured enough.\u201d \n\nCointelegraph also sought the opinion of a bitcoin lawyer in Dmitry Machihin from Cointelegraph Blockchain Legal.

If someone stole your key and made some illegal transactions with BTC the only legal way to get some justice is to complain to police or other responsible authorities with all known information. Almost in each country you have a special police department which occupies only IT crimes and hacking is most popular among these crimes. I cannot give an example of such case, where violated rights of a BTC owner was restored but I can ensure that anyway you must always do your best and this approach could lead to some changes in legal insecurity of cryptocurrencies.

It can be viewed as a membership organisation in the cloud that acts as a global database for copyright-related information.\u201d \nMonetising music to fiat and crypto\nMUSE suites for variety of music-related payments such as royalties, music sales, merchandise and concert ticket sales. Moreover, it is easy to use not just for cryptocurrency users but for anyone as OpenLedger offers a fiat gateway that allows consumers to buy music and artists to sell it for USD, or to be correct for crypto-USD. MUSE thereby permits global B2B, C2B and P2P transfers of value, bypassing the legacy banking system entirely if need be.\nLicensing music with smart contracts on the Blockchain\nMUSE allows the \u00a0use of smart contracts capabilities to ensure music licensing using a distributed ledger. Thus, an artist can store basic copyright data about a song in the Blockchain. Moreover, they can input licensing conditions enforcing different fees for using a song as a soundtrack, in movies, TV commercials, etc.\nAccording to the official press release, users can also use the Automatic Royalty Payment Splitter to set down transparent rules to divide payments when they are received. It allows setting the way received payments will be divided between various individuals and labels depending on in which country the song was streamed.\n\nVIP-pass or fan club membership privileges trade\nArtists can sell or give-away specially designed Tokens as a VIP-pass or fan club membership to their fans. These, limited in number, Tokens may work as discounts on merchandise, concert tickets or as backstage passes. The value of each Token can also vary and change depending on that artist\u2019s popularity on PeerTracks.\nC\u00e9dric Cobban, President and Founder of PeerTracks explained this unique feature of the Tokens:\n \u201cEveryone is excited about an instant and transparent royalty payment system coming into existence.

I've seen firsthand how drivers are treated and how feedback is ignored.\nUber and Lyft are run by nerds in San Francisco. To them, drivers are just numbers. The fares that determine drivers' livelihood are just levers to push and pull to maximize profit. The driver uproar and mass protests following last week\u2019s rate decrease tells me this is the perfect time to launch a decentralized alternative.\nArcade City is beginning with a grand conversation with drivers. Our question: If you had to design a ride-sharing app that best met the needs of riders and drivers, what would it include? The amazing ideas contributed just this week will keep us busy for years.\n\nCT: How about newer ride-sharing platforms such as La\u2019Zooz?\nCD: La\u2019Zooz ran a great experiment with their proof-of-movement token, and we will look at integrating similar ideas down the road. We are in touch with their team and expect to work together with them moving forward.\nBut our approach to the critical mass problem is a bit different. We are taking a hybrid approach, combining distributed dynamics with the type of service people expect today of a company like Uber. The objective is total decentralization on the blockchain, but we are starting with an emphasis on driver engagement and integrating driver feedback.\nThere are countless thousands of angry Uber and Lyft drivers looking for an alternative. We\u2019ll start by building what they want, then move in the direction that we know will maximally benefit both drivers and customers over the long term: decentralization on the blockchain.\nCT: What are the technical aspects of the platform you're using?\nCD: In February we are launching a simple MVP app for Android and iOS. Nothing complicated, just simple ride requests with basic gamification to build the Arcade network, using the same referral-based promotional tactics that got us 500 drivers signed up in our first week. Ethereum integration will begin in the spring.\nThe key technical differences between Arcade City and the big ride-sharers stem from how our operation is structured. Not like the hub-and-spoke model of Uber and Lyft, with a headquarters in San Francisco centrally setting rates for a number of independent contractors that border closely on employees. We\u2019re building a peer-to-peer network like a mesh, and taking a page from Rick Falkvinge\u2019s book Swarmwise by pushing the relevant decision-making authority out to the edges of the network. For Arcade City, that means empowering drivers with tools to create their own recurring customer base and make their own decisions like any entrepreneur would.\nThe Achilles\u2019 heel of Uber and Lyft is their centralized management of pricing. This week's uproar by drivers \u2014 and their willingness to join an alternative \u2014 shows the failure of that approach. You cannot build a long-term relationship with drivers if you are taking away their ability to set their own pricing. Arcade City will decentralize those decisions to the level of the driver and their customers.\nIn the end, Arcade City will be a protocol composed of Ethereum smart contracts supporting a global logistics network with an entire ecosystem of apps and businesses running on top of our infrastructure. What SMTP is to email, Arcade City will become for distributed logistics.\nCT: How are drivers getting paid? Bitcoin? US dollars?\nCD: At launch we will offer two payment modes: peer-to-peer and gamified. Peer-to-peer mode will let drivers accept whatever payment methods they want to work out with their customers. They can take cash, credit cards through Square, PayPal, Bitcoin, whatever they feel like supporting \u2014 and keep 100% of their fare. Or they can use gamification mode, which requires payment through the app and offers perks and prizes for \u2018leveling up\u2019 your driver or rider profile. Think Habitica meets Uber.\nWe expect most rides at launch to be peer-to-peer mode because we won\u2019t yet have much built out in the realm of payment processors and the like. But by summer we expect most rides to be gamified, which will let us take a transaction fee. We plan to always have a lower fee than Uber and Lyft. They take 20% or 25%, we will only take 10%. About half of that 10% will go up the tree of referrals to pay whomever recruited that driver, and a similar referral tree for riders.\nDown the road it will be interesting to offer drivers and riders the opportunity to pay in Bitcoin instead of USD and pay fewer fees. Can we make it easy and worthwhile for consumers to pay in Bitcoin, and drivers to request to be paid out in Bitcoin? By tying Bitcoin adoption to additional rewards in our gamification layer, we definitely think so.\nCT: Are you worried about running into legal issues by using such a radical platform?\nCD: Excited, not worried. Approximately all laws about ridesharing are outdated and in need of revision.", "birthday": "2016-01-20T17:42:00+00:00", "date": "2016-01-20 17:42:00", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 20}

So much has happened during the two years, it seems pretty amazing. We managed to develop the masternode concept, along with instant transactions, privacy, funding and governance. I\u2019m pretty happy with the progress that we\u2019ve made.\nCT: What was your vision for Dash when you founded it? Now two years later, do you think you have achieved what you set out to do with Dash?\nED: When I originally discovered Bitcoin in early 2010, one of my original concerns was that the platform of cryptocurrency is giant and the Bitcoin developers were only focusing in a very small area of what was possible. My first thought was to add some core-features to the Dash client, such as anonymity, then to explore the potential of the cryptographic currency platform and see what other kinds of features could be created.\nSince then, we\u2019ve managed to implement a new kind of peer-to-peer network known as a two-tier network, which fully incentivizes full-node operators. Using the masternode network concept (also known as a two-tier network), we\u2019ve been able to implement a great feature set for our users such as instant double-spend proof transactions, transactional privacy, decentralized funding and decentralized governance. The project has been a great success over the past couple of years and I\u2019m quite happy with the progress we\u2019ve made.\nCT: In the two years since you founded Dash, what do you think has changed in the cryptocurrency market- both for the better and the worse?\nED:\u00a0During the past two years, there has been a great awakening of the general public to the power of cryptographic currency for solving many of the problems with the legacy banking system, along with an understanding that this technology is not a fad. This is quite important because Bitcoin defies some principles in classic economic theory, mainly concerning where the value of money comes from. The longer that Bitcoin and other cryptographic currencies survive, the more merit we have of disproving this old theory and possibly replacing it with another theory that is better suited for explaining the value of money and why a network such as the Bitcoin network can maintain its value when many originally thought it wouldn\u2019t. This is great for long term adoption, as it will take a shift in the academic mindset in order to convince the general population that these technologies are safe to use.\n\nCT: What do you think puts Dash at an advantage when compared to other cryptocurrencies?", "birthday": "2016-01-21T11:10:00+00:00", "date": "2016-01-21 11:10:00", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 21}

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/emercoin-implements-solution-to-reduce-blocksize-inflation", "title": " Emercoin Implements Solution To Reduce Blocksize Inflation ", "content": "A very controversial problem today in cryptocurrency is the idea of \u201cblocksize\u201d, which has become unaddressed in the field over the past year. With concern growing over\u00a0blockchain inflation and how well this technology will be able to scale, cryptocurrency\u00a0Emercoin has taken a proactive approach and has granted Cointelegraph exclusive access to their solution.\nEvery cryptocurrency can only spend the entire Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) when making a transaction. When a wallet contains many past transactions and needs to make a new outgoing transaction (payment), the wallet will select the best subset of suitable UTXO's to generate the payment. A model of this creative logic is as follows:\nNumber of possible subsets is 2N, where N is the number of available \u00a0UTXOs. Therefore, if the wallet contains more than ~20 UTXOs, it will be practically impossible to check all of them and find the optimal subset of UTXOs to use.\nThe Current Solution\nBitcoin and many other cryptocurrency wallets use a stochastic approach for selecting an optimal subset of UTXOs. In this algorithm, the wallet performs 1000 attempts at random UTXO selections. A subset with a minimal amount is then used to fit the output transaction. Afterwards, a payment transaction is generated with 2 outputs: A payment output and a change output. The probability of finding the optimal solution where the sum of UTXO subsets exactly matches the output value is extremely low. Emercoin has estimated the probability to look like (approximately formula):\n(Nfit * Nattempts) / (2N).\nWhere:\nN is the number of UTXOs,\nNfit is the number of possible optimal transactions (without change),\nNattempts is 1000 for the current Bitcoin wallet code\nA More Efficient Solution Is Needed\nIn the current implementation, there is a high probability that the optimal subset of UTXO will be missed. As a result, an unnecessary second UTXO is generated and added into the transaction, increasing the size of the transaction. As the number of additional active UTXOs increases, so does the size of the underlying blockchain. This produces the dreaded blockchain inflation the industry is working so hard to find a solution for.\nAdditionally, this approach generates a huge volume of UTXOs with trivial values, also known as \"gold sand\" \u00a0or \"dust\". In aggregation, these are considered a type of spam and are generally undesirable. \u00a0With blockchain technology adoption increasing exponentially, the world is in need of a better method to address UTXOs.\nThe project is heavily dependent upon the use of dynamic programming. What is dynamic programming as used in this solution? Dynamic programming is a very powerful technique to solve a particular class of problems. It demands very elegant formulation of the approach and simple thinking and the coding part is very easy.\nEmercoin\u2019s Solution\nEmercoin looks for areas of opportunity within the industry and brings a forward thinking, proactive mindset towards blockchain development and innovation. Our most recent innovation is the Transaction Optimizer, which is an algorithm that selects the optimal subset of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXO) for a new outgoing transaction (payment).\nIf an exact UTXO subset exists for any given amount output, this subset will always be found by the Transaction Optimizer and utilized to complete a new transaction. The additional and unnecessary second UTXO is no longer being generated, reducing the amount of information being input into the transaction on the blockchain. The Optimizer uses a dynamic programming approach and requires:\nO(V) memory and O(V*N) time, which is much more optimized than the\u00a0current O(2N)\nWhere:\nV is the value of the TX output.\nThe Optimizer can also efficiently utilize existing \"gold sand\" and \"dust\" transactions, further reducing the blockchain size and \"cleaned up\". The Transaction Optimizer code is open source, and available on the official Emercoin Github for analysis and use in other cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms.\nOleg Khovayko, CTO of EmerCoin, told Cointelegraph:", "birthday": "2016-01-15T16:05:00+00:00", "date": "2016-01-15 16:05:00", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 15}

You would probably ask: how so, if the price fell to $2.90 and continues to decrease? But take a look at the chart of LTC:BTC \u2013 Litecoin exchange rate is fixed higher than 0.008, and even reaching 0.0084. This means that the price of $2.90 speaks not about weakness of Litecoin, but about the weakness of Bitcoin during a whole bunch of bad news (the report of RAND on need of fight against digital currencies, bankruptcy of Cryptsy, the next split in Bitcoin Foundation and a statement of Mike Hearn). Moreover, new discussions on the size of the Bitcoin block have begun again\n.\nIn the beginning of 2016 Litecoin price was noticeably higher than $3.40. It has created a small triangle with an exit up to $3.64 by January 7. But then Litecoin started falling continuously having reached today's $2.90.\nNow it is impossible to give the forecast for the next week. The negative factors didn't affect the Bitcoin price fully yet. Panic sales are still possible, which will give us an opportunity to buy really inexpensive Litecoins. But price correction are possible and it can turn the trend up at any time.\nDASH\n\nDASH price grows by 10-20% a day. DASH price even grew from $3 to $4, despite the falling of Bitcoin.\nDASH don't care about the problems with block size, emergence of new forks or the problems of regulators and exchange collapses. The exchange rates have already reached 0.01, or 100 DASH for one Bitcoin. Traders willing to buy DASH may now only dream about the exchange rates of 0.0055, which were available only a month ago.\nThroughout the whole week, a steady uptrend was developing and next week we may expect corrections to begin. For example, it may drop the price to the level of 0.0075. However, one note: it is impossible to be sure that this correction surely has to happen.\nDogecoin\n\nDogecoin grew more than by 30%, having surely fixed on 40 Satoshi in the beginning of 2016. The top was reached on January 9 with the price of 49 Satoshi. It especially pleased those who bought Dogecoin on January 8 for 30 Satoshi. It seems now that we won't see the price of 30 Satoshi again for a long time. But buy orders on 33-36 are still possible and even desirable.\nNext week it is worth expecting price fluctuations around 40 Satoshi or falling to 35 Satoshi and below.\nETH\n\nETH breaks records with the continuous growth that proceeds this week. It jumped from 0.0022 to 0.0034, thus trading volumes are record-breaking high as well.\nThis success is connected with the active advertising and PR campaign of Ethereum and an anti-advertising of Bitcoin that began synchronously. At the moment no possible changes of the trend are visible, but also I would not recommend traders to make purchases next week, as its already too late. If the price growth proceeds, it may stop being so rough at any moment. Moreover, ETH can stop moving up and even fall sharply.\nPeercoin", "birthday": "2016-01-17T11:44:00+00:00", "date": "2016-01-17 11:44:00", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 17}

The consequence was an abrupt drop in the value of Bitcoin and a lot of discussion all over the net. But what are the real motivations behind Hearn\u2019s leaving?\nMike Hearn\nMike has developed the Java version of the Bitcoin software, and has been working with the technology for around five years. He left a good job as a security engineer at Google, just to risk his career in the Bitcoin world. This should make him a person above any suspicion.\n \u201cI\u2019ve spent more than 5 years being a Bitcoin developer. The software I\u2019ve written has been used by millions of users, hundreds of developers, and the talks I\u2019ve given have led directly to the creation of several startups. I\u2019ve talked about Bitcoin on Sky TV and BBC News. I have been repeatedly cited by the Economist as a Bitcoin expert and prominent developer. I have explained Bitcoin to the SEC, to bankers and to ordinary people I met at cafes.\u201d \nBut we must not forget one thing: the interests behind Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are huge, and I\u2019m not talking about the miners\u2019 Bitcoin reward. If there\u2019s something that can relieve humanity from the perverted money production system of Central Banks, it\u2019s Bitcoin (and probably nothing else).\nBitcoin developers continuously receive death threats, and Mike could have been among them, especially after the big fight that took place on the block size change. On word of Mike, he\u2019s leaving because the Bitcoin experiment has failed, and the situation he is painting is surely not an easy one, but how much can he be trusted in this situation?\nHearn is the one that tried to sneak \u201cBlacklisting code\u201d into Bitcoin XT: a piece of code that would \u201cmark\u201d Bitcoins, and would prove useful in case of theft, but he didn\u2019t document it anywhere, and also pushed another \u201chidden\u201d technical feature to neutralize the use of Bitcoin over the TOR network, justifying the addition as a prevention against DDoS attacks on Bitcoin nodes.\n\nConspiracy Theory\nHearn quitting comes exactly in conjunction with an interesting thread on Reddit, that explains how much Bitcoin is doomed, how it is inferior to Ethereum and \u201cmust be replaced\u201d. The thread link has been spammed to a lot of users.\nBut there\u2019s more: in November 2015, Hearn joined R3CEV, a new cryptocurrency project backed by 30 large banks from all over the world.\nFirst of all, by joining a project funded by banks, Hearn clearly shows that he never understood (or was going to follow) the deep motivation behind the creation of Bitcoin: removing the ground under the Central Banks\u2019 feet.\nCoincidences in life happen all the time, but in business? Not so much. Is it possible that Bitcoin is undergoing an organized assault to destroy its value?\nAnother interesting thread on Reddit brings up what seems to be irrefutable proof that Hearn is in cahoots with the R3CEV organization for the destruction of Bitcoin.\n  \nThis week really seems the one chosen by somebody to spread FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) over Bitcoin.\nBitcoin has several enemies: banks and governments in primis, but we shouldn\u2019t forget competing cryptocurrencies. And this project R3CEV is a conjunction of both.\nApart from the traditional monetary world, if there\u2019s somebody that has a lot to earn from the fall of Bitcoin, it\u2019s the altcoins. A lot of people have spent a lot of time on altcoins and alternative blockchain projects. Some of these have also been funded with hundreds of thousands of dollars, in some cases millions and some of these investors have a lot of power in their hands.\nFran Strajnar, Co-founder of BraveNewCoin, says that we probably shouldn\u2019t care too much what banks are doing:\n \u201cThe reality is that we are 100% going to see 5-6 major blockchains for different uses. This cannot be stopped as anybody can write a blockchain now, but the question is: what does this mean for bitcoin. Should Bitcoin even care what these guys do? I would say let's not care what the banks do. Bitcoin is already here and has its own problems for scaling. if these problems are solved, Bitcoin will do its own thing. We will have 2 different communities: Bitcoin & 'Distributed Ledger Industry', doing different things in different sectors, and maybe 10-15 years from now, people will start to want interoperability between these private chains and Bitcoin.\u201d \n\nHere we have a group of 30 banks that have invested an unknown sum of money on a new blockchain project, and they probably need to defuse Bitcoin, if they want to have success with their project.\nThe opinion of Oleg Khovayko, Computer Science expert and CTO at Emercoin, is that R3CEV is a laboratory, an entity external to banks that allows them \u201cplay\u201d with the new technology without being affected by the stringent bank regulators:\n \u201cBanks are strictly regulated. Because of this, every serious bank has a powerful legal department, and every bank action is approved in there. Cryptocurrency, instead, is \u201cterra incognita\u201d, something that seems to have some relationship to money, but it is not safe for a bank to treat, and nobody knows what benefit the blockchain can bring to banks yet. So, banks set up this consortium and cooperate to create an external entity: R3CEV. If anything happens in that, they won\u2019t be affected.\u201d \n\nThe Standard\nHowever, a replacement for Bitcoin is far from easy to produce, for a simple reason: Bitcoin is the standard.\nThere was a time when Windows wasn\u2019t as good as it is now, it was terrible, and in comparison to MacOS and AmigaOS it was really terrible. Despite this, Windows kept selling much more than anything else, because it was already spread over millions of users, it had a huge applications park, and PC parts were cheaper, in some cases much cheaper, than Macs and Amigas. It was crappy, but Windows was the standard de facto.\nLater on MacOS was recovered and rebuilt by that marketing and managing genius of Steve Jobs, but Amiga died. If it hadn\u2019t been for Jobs, MacOS would have died as well.\nWith Bitcoin, we are in the same situation: Bitcoin is not the best technology out there, there are some that are technologically superior, but Bitcoin is the first that has set foot.\nIt\u2019s hugely adopted when viewed in respect to other cryptocurrencies and a lot of people have put money in it, some have put a lot, some much less, but everybody in the Bitcoin community has interest in keeping it alive and seeing it walk up its path.\nAt the moment, Bitcoin is the standard de facto, and by a long shot. A conspiracy to kill it shouldn\u2019t be watched like something strange or improbable, quite the opposite: there\u2019s business, and there\u2019s fight, and this is exactly what\u2019s happening.", "birthday": "2016-01-17T15:50:00+00:00", "date": "2016-01-17 15:50:00", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 17}

Did they have to close because of their own incompetency? Or Is the BTM business not beneficial anymore? Cointelegraph conducted a survey of experts from the \u00a0Bitcoin ATM market. \u00a0\n\nTheir own doing?\nRobocoin was one of the first entrants in the business of Bitcoin ATM manufacturing. Did they have to close their business because it was not sustainable anymore because of their own shortcomings? \u00a0Most industry experts believe that this is the case.\nPeter Trcek, CEO of Bitnik says:\n \u201cThey did not give out full control of the machine, had extremely expensive (and impractical) hardware and wanted to retain a portion of operator's profit. Their business model was risky and it now failed. It's their own business decisions and attitude towards operators that caused their downfall.\u201d \nEric Grill, CEO of CoinOutlet\u00a0also believes that fault lies with Robocoin itself:\n \u201cRobocoin machines were never very well received by the community, the unfair contracts they made the operator's sign with them was pushed onto the customer in extra fees not to mention the exorbitant pricing structure.\u201d \nBTMs not Profitable Anymore?\nAnother reason why Robocoin had to close its Bitcoin services could be because the entire market for BTMs is not profitable anymore.\nMichael Dupree, founder of Easybit, thinks it is a two way street. As per him, it is a difficult business but profit is possible.\nDupree said:\n \u201cIt\u2019s not really about a profit model it's more about logistics and compliance at this point. Profit is possible, though many are unsuccessful due to poor management, etc. Those trying to make a quick buck aren\u2019t doing the ecosystem any good - and likely won\u2019t go very far.\u201d \nHenry Brade, CEO of Bittiraha, said:\n \u201cBitcoin ATM business is certainly profitable but it depends on a lot of factors.

BargainFox and Georgi Georgiev do not think so. In fact, they have even put together an infographic presenting 33 indicators that bitcoin growth is not slowing down this year. However, as we looked closer, only some can be considered indications of growth in 2016 - more than half are merely FYI facts, others are open to interpretation.\nWe contacted the author to clarify his intention, but received no comment. What follows is our brief overview of the infographic. We divided the indicators into those that are likely to mean continued growth of bitcoin, those that are questionable, and those that are informative facts without a clear link to bitcoin growth in 2016.\nIndicators that bitcoin will continue to grow\n\nFive major exchanges have multiplied their volumes up to 8 times and have traded almost $200 million worth of bitcoin in total. While this is still a drop in the ocean, slightly above the GDP of Marshall Islands, the speed at which this drop is getting bigger is an indicator of continued growth in 2016.\n\nDaily transaction volumes in 7-year-old Bitcoin have surpassed 164-year-old giant Western Union. Next in line are Square valued at $5 billion in its last funding round and PayPal whose growth versus Bitcoin is slowing down.\n\nWhile we must note that Bitcoin and PayPal are in astronomically different weight categories as to absolute volume, they are pretty close on daily transaction volume, thus comparing their user growth rates is an interesting indicator. \u00a0\n\nBitcoin is still in its hyped early adopter phase, growing fast among tech enthusiasts and slowly but surely attracting brave businesses over recent years. PayPal is already a behemoth convincing more conservative potential users and battling difficult legislations to fuel their growth.\nHowever, what this indicator says is that if you rely on historical data and predict continued growth of PayPal in 2016, it is consistent to expect the same for Bitcoin, whose growth is even faster.\n\nTransaction fees are one of the main teasers for pragmatic Bitcoin adopters. Since major wallet services started hedging users against exchange rate volatility, bitcoin has become a viable, and even attractive alternative payment method.\n\nIf 2014 was a bloody massacre for Bitcoin price and confidence, 2015 yielded slow but steady stabilization. In 2014 Bitcoin enthusiasts were trying to uphold the hype by quoting tech giants Dell, Microsoft and Overstock.com who accept bitcoin, even if their settlements with Coinbase and BitPay were still 90-100% USD-based. After the currency lost over half of its value, volatility was quoted as the main reason why Bitcoin would never be accepted without immediate conversion into fiat. In 2015, the volatility subsided, which could be stretched into a positive argument: less volatility = higher user confidence.\n\nBitcoin-based innovations have attracted almost $1 billion in venture capital investment to date, more than half of that coming in 2015. While the growth has slowed down in 2015 due to a rough 2014, the trend did not reverse and investors continued to put their money in Bitcoin-based businesses, reaching a record amount.\nWhile a notable portion of it was invested in previously held companies to fuel further growth, the very fact that investors still believe \u00a0it is worth financing these businesses in 2015 is a bet for a favourable 2016.\nQuestionable indicators\n\nAs expected, the first investment in 2013 was received by developed countries with strong tech talent. However, the trend over the next two years includes more and more developing states with smaller economies but emerging tech hubs like Kenya or Netherlands, as well as politically and economically unstable Argentina. With Bitcoin investments now reaching countries on all continents, the trend is positive.\nHowever, although the number of new countries receiving Bitcoin VC investments continued to grow in 2015, it halved from what it was in 2014. Together with a slowdown in the total volume of VC investments mentioned earlier, this may be an indication that investors are being more cautious with bets in new markets than in 2014.\n\nIn 2014 VC investment has grown in all major industry areas, except universal businesses. Venture capitalists are placing the heftiest bets on wallets and financial services, followed by mining and payment processing. It would be interesting to see the stats for 2015, as there have been several notable rounds, including $116m for 21 Inc Bitcoin computer for developers, $75m for CoinBase wallet and $25m for bitcoin miner BitFury, which made it the most funded miner to date.\nWithout data for 2015, it is hard to say whether this trend is applicable to predict a rise in 2016, as growth of other VC indicators has slowed down in 2015.\n\nInvestor names range from relatively new VCs specializing in the sector like Digital Currency Group to well-known professionals with pedigree like Andreessen Horowitz that have grown and exited Skype, Instagram, Groupon and other well-known companies.\nThis is a positive fact in general, and could be stretched to say that these investors are likely to attract more prominent names in 2016, however, it does not directly imply more investment in 2016.\n\nCompetition to Bitcoin is emerging and growing. The 5 most popular alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) have a market cap of $407 million. This indicates that competitors see a lucrative market opportunity.\nHowever, using absolute values of market cap without a timeline, this does not show whether competitors slowed down in 2015, as did many other indicators. Notable total market cap does not automatically mean that they will continue to grow in 2016.\n\nExciting bitcoin-based startup companies are emerging. Here are some highlights. Does it necessarily mean growth in 2016? No. It means that startups and their investors believe they will be successful in 2016. But have we seen a year when they wouldn\u2019t? Exciting companies were emerging in 2013 as well, everyone was cheering for a whooping 2014 and we saw a major crash.\nGreat startups are an indicator of excitement in a generally hot scene, which is not directly indicative of growth in 2016. Slowing growth in VC investments, while bitcoin penetration is still so low, tells us something else.\nFYI facts\nNow these 12 indicators are further stressed by just as many FYI facts from the past to build a positive context around Bitcoin, without any particular link to 2016.\n\n\nOver 7,000 merchants accept bitcoin as mode of payment. Even though most convert it to fiat at a 100% rate right away, this incentivizes individuals to adopt bitcoin as a mode of payment, and not just as a speculative tool.\nBut does a list of top merchants indicate anything about growth in 2016? Right in the next graphic we see that the number of major merchants that started accepting bitcoin in 2015 has shrunk more than 3x since 2014. It is a positive fact that new merchants are joining, but due to the slower rate it cannot be used as an indicator of growth in 2016.\n\nIt is generally positive to see 5 top bitcoin service providers. However, since they were not established in 2015, it is hardly an indication of growth in 2016, particularly. The only relevant fact in this graphic is that Coinify was the Winner of IFM Awards as Best Payment Solutions provider.\n\nNot mentioning that most of these retailers convert all bitcoin into fiat right at the moment of purchase, what does this fact tell us? There are many retailers accepting bitcoin worldwide. None of the Top 10 has joined in 2015. It is not clear how this indicates growth in 2016. We could flip it and say that none of the ten dumped bitcoin in 2015. However, that would still not mean more growth in 2016.\n\n\nThe incentives for merchants and retailers go beyond following the latest fad and attracting tech-savvy customers. Not having to bear the losses from fraudulent payments is another strong argument. But it was true in 2015, just as it was in 2013. This fact should not fuel extra growth in 2016, unless we factor in that notably more merchants would suddenly become aware of it this year. Which the graphic doesn\u2019t.\n8 industries are most actively using bitcoin. However, the link between listing these 8 industries and projecting bitcoin growth in 2016 is unclear.\n\nA rising number of Bitcoin ATMs are being installed letting users convert cash into bitcoin. 471 Bitcoin ATMs worldwide is surely better than none. However, if we compare that to at least 3 million regular ATMs, it is still a drop in the ocean. Even more so, if this drop is spread across just 2 countries. This fact indicates user interest and it indicates potential, but it does not indicate growth of bitcoin in 2016, particularly.\n\nThis sure is an interesting fact. The presence of at least 5 competitors also indicates that they see a market opportunity. However, is it relevant to talk about market shares if there are just a few hundred ATMs on the market? More importantly, without a timeline this fact does not indicate much about growth of bitcoin in 2016.\n", "birthday": "2016-01-19T10:00:00+00:00", "date": "2016-01-19 10:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 19}

However it is a very political decision to knowingly kill public sector jobs en masse.

Today, CoinMap.org lists over 7,000 businesses employing Bitcoin worldwide.\nCointelegraph talked to several business owners, both legal and extralegal, about their use of Bitcoin.\nWhite Market\u00a0\nDr. Darren Tapp, Ph.D., a mathematics professor who teaches mainly homeschooled children, started using bitcoin as a toy.\n \u201cAs I learned more about it, I started to realize that bitcoin or something like it will change the future.\u201d \nHe believes accepting Bitcoin helps him retain certain clients who pay with it exclusively.\nResponding to local market demand\nMatthew Ping, a property manager who manages several rental units in the Manchester, New Hampshire area, adopted Bitcoin to facilitate the rent payment process.\n \u201cThere was a market demand for it in Manchester and I\u2019m intrigued by the technology. \u00a0As a property manager I received the request to accept bitcoin because some of my residents get paid in bitcoin. I want to make it easier and less expensive for my residents to pay rent on time.\u201d \nAbility to instantly accept payments\nAnd largely, this has helped Ping\u2019s business, since he can receive on-time payments when residents are traveling anywhere in the world, without accruing an additional transaction cost or waiting for a check to arrive. However, he doesn\u2019t see using Bitcoin as being without complications.\n \u201cIt is sometimes difficult because the mortgage lenders and vendors don\u2019t accept bitcoin yet. The rent payments have to be converted by using a service like Bitpay or Coinbase which make the facilitation much easier but still somewhat of a hassle.\u201d \nCompliance with all local regulations\nPing seeks to operate in complete compliance with all local governmental regulations for the security of his business.\n \u201cI operate my business above ground because I am a licensed Real Estate Broker. \u00a0I follow all rules and regulations set forth by the state and I wouldn\u2019t do anything to jeopardize my livelihood.\u201d \nDr. Tapp also operates above ground and reports income etc. to all applicable authorities, but admittedly faces less regulatory hurdles than Ping.\n \u201cThe whole point of my project is to provide services outside of a highly regulated industry. Since I do not offer any certification, \u00a0I am not a school, and I do not claim to be accredited there are no applicable regulations to comply with.\u201d \nBlack Market\u00a0\nOn the other side of the equation, Cointelegraph interviewed Bitcoin-using business owners who explicitly choose to avoid government compliance. Ron Helwig, creator and owner of Shire Silver, an alternative currency based on precious metals, chooses not to report any of his activities to regulators.\n \u201cWell, I have no contact with government, if that's what you mean. No registration of the business, no taxes, no filings. The business isn't a corporation of any kind.\u201d \nGovernment cooperation as unprofitable\nAmanda B. Johnson, co-founder of daily cryptocurrency and peer-to-peer network news show, has also not sought out compliance with any legal or governmental framework.\n \u201cWe try to only do things that are profitable, and I wouldn\u2019t consider a government partnership to be profitable.\u201d \nJohnson, who heavily relies on Bitcoin as it makes up roughly 90% of her business, sees it as immensely practical.\n\n \u201cSending and receiving payments is so fast and easy, and when they\u2019re received they\u2019re confirmed within 20 minutes, so it\u2019s not days with a bank, it\u2019s not I have to go to an ATM now, it\u2019s not I have to go deposit a check now.

Gox compromise. If you haven't lost coin yourself, I'm sure you've heard of those who have. The reasons vary, but all come down in the end to a lack of experience and education.\nAs we go about bringing bitcoin more into use in our day-to-day lives, it becomes important to have a basic understanding of what bitcoin is, how it works, and how we can use it without putting our value at unnecessary risk.\nA very short primer on Bitcoin and the Blockchain\nFirstly, Bitcoin is a layer on top of an accounting abstraction implemented in software called 'the blockchain'. Think of the blockchain as the network, and bitcoin as a protocol running on that network. Some have called the blockchain a 'peer-to-peer ledger', and they have the peer-to-peer part right, but it is very much more journal than ledger. It 'contains' a large list of transactions. The people who run the programs or 'nodes' that record the transactions are paid in bitcoin, and the 'records' they create are called 'blocks'.\nIt's important to note that bitcoin transactions are stored cryptographically. No one actually 'holds' the coin; they hold cryptographic keys to the coin. These keys come in pairs, one public and one private. The public key is used to check the balance and make deposits; the private is used to 'sweep\u2019 or collect the coin from the key pair. Every transaction represents a movement of some value, and so that value is always finally 'stored' in some key pair. The point is, the key pair is the wallet; not the paper it's printed on, not the website holding your coin, not the software in your mobile phone.\nThe disposition of your coin is under the control of whoever has the private keys.\nCommon Sense\nPeople like to say that bitcoin is a 'digital currency'. That's not quite right, for all that it is wed to networks and the Internet; it is more accurately described as a 'cryptographic currency', or 'cryptocurrency'. In either case, the same sort of common sense rules apply as if you were using cash or a line of credit through a bank.\nRoles\nIt is good to form a habit of asking yourself what you are doing with bitcoin today. Investing? Buying a product or service online? Selling some bitcoin in person? There are many things you might be doing with bitcoin; being very aware of what you are doing and what you hope to accomplish helps avoid missteps and losses. The key is, do one thing at the time, and only keep coin on your person (or accessible on the Internet) that you intend to dispose of in the near term. If you are sweeping your cold storage to your mobile to have funds for coffee and donuts for your office, you should probably be a little more careful.\nServices\nThere are many companies offering many services in the marketplace. Before signing up for a service, make certain you understand the services provided and how those services solve problems for you. For instance, if you aren't going to be actively trading, you probably don't need to go through the hassles of signing up for a full exchange account.\nWallets\nIn it's finest essence, the 'wallet' is the public/private key pair. However, the way in which the wallet is implemented in the physical world is of considerable importance.\nLet us suppose for a moment that we can all memorize our key pairs with complete accuracy, and as many of them as we will need. We could safely store bitcoin in these wallets without any problem at all. However, we can't do that, so we need ways of recording the keys, and retrieving them as needed; and some ways are more convenient for some purposes than others.\nTypes of Wallet\nLet us briefly break down the various types of wallets. Firstly, there are web-based wallets. These might be associated with a service. If so, they are likely to be attached to the service via a sidechain for purposes of paying for the service or perhaps trading. Then there are web wallets as such as a service; the primary usefulness of which is convenience. There are also the hardware wallets, which generally provide some electronic security and some key storage. Lastly, the so called 'paper wallet', which can take many physical forms. The important thing to remember is that the key pair is the wallet; these physical implements simply encode and store key pairs.\n\nUtility\nEach type of wallet is useful for different reasons, and each has unique security strengths and weaknesses.\nService Wallets\nWeb wallets attached to services are very useful; they facilitate rapid payment for the attached services. Are such wallets good for long term asset storage? It depends on your level of trust in the service provider. Probably not. Are they useful in other respects? Yes, they are indisposable for trading, purchasing coin, or cashing out to fiat currency.\nGeneral Purpose Web Wallets\nMore generic web wallet services are useful in a variety of ways, most of which involve using them temporarily on an as-needed basis. Paper wallets are really any reasonably durable material that has a key pair encoded on or in it. Literal paper wallets are useful for private retention of key pairs according to conventional security practices; e.g., in a safe or safe deposit box. They can also be a convenient means to deliver coin to another party, without using devices.\nMobile/PC Wallets\nMobile and PC wallets are software systems for phones and computers that implement wallets. Wallets on such devices are only as secure as the device. Your level of comfort should vary with the amount of bitcoin on the device at any given time.\nHardware Wallets\nFinally, hardware wallets provide the security features of a paper wallet, but typically with an additional layer of security provided by hardware level cryptography.\nSecurity and Utility: Two Sides of the Same Coin\nBitcoin is like any other currency in many respects; if you leave it laying around, someone will pick it up. If you leave it in someone else's care and they get lost, so does your coin. That being said, strategic use of wallets can go a long way to keeping your coin safe and in your control.", "birthday": "2016-01-14T12:25:00+00:00", "date": "2016-01-14 12:25:00", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 14}

Could this be a perfect opportunity for Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrency startups to break into the largest market in Africa?\nAnother new policy\nIn a press conference by the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele on Monday January 11 2016, he announced that the nation\u2019s apex bank will be stopping the sale of forex to Bureaux De Change operators within the country. Mr. Emefiele also announced that the ban on dollar deposit into domiciliary accounts by individuals or corporations in commercial banks was being lifted. This was a ban which took effect from the first week of August 2015 after the release of a circular signed by the Director of Trade and Exchange of the CBN, Isiaka Gbadamosi. Here is a summary of the announcement:\n \u201ca) The Bank would henceforth discontinue its sales of foreign exchange to BDCs. Operators in this segment of the market would now need to source their foreign exchange from autonomous sources.

She has started a petition calling for ACCC action of control over banks\u2019 actions in regard to Bitcoin.\nThis is only one of the latest of several events that are affecting small Bitcoin traders and miners all around the world, and the situation is expected to worsen day by day, while governments and banks try to squeeze Bitcoin out of their countries.\nBut do not despair: as Mahatma Gandhi once said:\n \u201cFirst they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you. Then you win.\u201d \nWell, that\u2019s a misattributed quote, as there\u2019s no proof Gandhi ever said that in his life, but we\u2019ll keep it as good for the sake of poetry. Anyway, the sentence fantastically applies to the history of Bitcoin.\nIn fact, we can identify a first embryonal period, from 2009 to 2010, when nearly nobody was aware of Bitcoin.\n\nFirst They Ignore You\nThen, from 2011 to 2012, Bitcoin\u2019s fame began to spread, but it was ignored: bankers, financial experts, and don\u2019t even mention common people, they didn\u2019t care about it at all. If you mentioned it to somebody, they would dismiss you with a \u201cwhat do you want to do with that?\u201d or \u201cwe don\u2019t need another currency\u201d or anything else. Bitcoin was simply too weak to convince most people it was worth something.\nIt was a thing for a very restricted population of the very open minded and people of the \u201crevolutionary\u201d type. Nerds and anarchists were its first adopters.\nSo many said it was just a phenomenon for nerds or a Ponzi scheme or simply an experiment that would have disappeared shortly. Very few could understand how it worked.\nThen They Laugh At You\nBut from 2013 to 2014, word of Bitcoin left the internet and it began to be mentioned on traditional media.\nThis was the mockery phase: many more people knew about Bitcoin now, but it just looked so strange and different from anything seen up to that moment, that nobody could believe it was of any value.\nLook at all those poor nerds wasting money on that Ponzi scheme! What is Bitcoin anyway?\nAlso some venture capitalists fell for this thing and wasted more than 300 millions of dollars! LOL!\nThere was a lot of laughter, yes.\nThen They Fight You\nBut 2015 has already changed everything. Bitcoin is definitely out of the clown costume except for a few obtuse remaining skeptics, and this year saw the switch from derision phase to fight phase. After almost one billion dollars were invested in Bitcoin infrastructures, softwares and services, the financial world finally understood that Bitcoin isn\u2019t a nerd quirk or a Ponzi, they are now well aware of the fact that Bitcoin is a concrete reality and it\u2019s stealing \u201ctheir\u201d money in the form of non-perceived fees on transactions. And it doesn\u2019t look to be easy to stop. Banks also understood that blockchain technology can be useful and they are implementing it in their systems in the hope that can help them fight Bitcoin.\nBut the most fearful of all are the Central Banks: for them, rulers over everything, Bitcoin is a wild horse that could spell their end.\nWell aware of the menace, top bankers are now speaking against Bitcoin on every possible occasion, still trying to ridicule it, but in a whole different manner: by including subtle menaces.\nAnd by their side, of course, governments do their part in their attempt to stop it, by banning banks from exchanging the cryptocurrency, or proposing absurd white papers for laws to ban cryptography from all mobile phones, and not wasting the chance of using terrorist attacks as an excuse to eliminate it altogether.\nThen You Win\nOr\u2026 do you?\nThe fight has started, it\u2019s a war, and it\u2019s difficult to say how long it will last. One thing is certain, Bitcoin can\u2019t win the war alone: its power are its users. Early adopters will have to fight for it and help clear its path, and the time is now. The third phase has just begun and the war will probably last years until Bitcoin will be so widely adopted that its resilience will grant it \u201cimmortality\u201d.\nThe War Is On\nApart the mentioned methods to try to eliminate Bitcoin from the scene, there are more \u201cin detail\u201d and straight ways to fight it, and some banks seem to be stretching the limits of legality.\nMichaela Juric, aka Bitcoin Babe, an Australian based Bitcoin trader recently stumbled into an episode that looks out of legality: her bank closed her account abruptly and claimed fraud after she sold around 10000 USD of Bitcoin to different clients. She must now rely on her clients\u2019 honesty to recover that money, and the bank didn\u2019t care about seeing her proof of a legitimate trade.\n \u201cI told my bank, no its not I did a KYC/AML check (made the customer take a selfie with their ID and then a photo of their ID next to the computer screen, clearly showing they are buying bitcoin). They refused to accept that, returned my funds to the buyers without proper investigation and shut down my account immediately. Because of the abrupt shut down, almost $10,000 worth of pending transfers into my account have now bounced, despite me already releasing bitcoin for these orders.\u201d \n\nTime For A Class Action\nMichaela says that this is only the latest in a series of episodes that seem like a concerted move to remove Bitcoin from circulation even though it hasn\u2019t been declared illegal, and the first time she\u2019s been called a fraud for selling Bitcoins.\nAfter this last event, she decided to start a petition to push the ACCC (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission) to investigate the banks\u2019 behaviour in regards to Bitcoin trading. She says that banks have no right to close accounts claiming fraud by people selling Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is legal in Australia:", "birthday": "2016-01-10T09:59:00+00:00", "date": "2016-01-10 09:59:00", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 10}

Bitcoin casinos are working hard to make their clients\u2019 experience even more pleasant and exciting. For example, NASCasino.com now offers provably fair games and they are able to redirect savings on processing fees / fraud into player bonuses and marketing. Casino representative, Stephen Turk, told Cointelegraph:\n \u201cI think bitcoin casinos are beginning to get a market share as Bitcoin has been very stable and indeed is rising in value.

Sasha Jade added:\n \u201cMy point is that real money fiat casinos will in 2016 start adding also bitcoin as payment method which will in turn cause the bitcoin gambling adoption to raise as more gamblers will learn about this new form of payment method\u201d.

Megafon, Beeline and other popular operators now accept Bitcoins through such services as Cryptonator and 7pay.in. Such services can make Bitcoin more attractive for ordinary Russian users.\nCryptonator also offers payment options for popular online games, such as World of Tanks, Perfect World and others. Besides, they can use Bitcoins to replenish their accounts in popular Russian social networks and Skype.\nHowever, the service doesn\u2019t make Bitcoin payments directly. They take Bitcoins, then convert it to RUR according to the system\u2019s internal rate and only then send the money to the final destination. the main thing that distinguishes Cryptonator from its competitors is that they work without fees.\nHowever, Vladimir Dubinin, COO of Distributed Lab, thinks it\u2019s impossible to provide such a service without fees. He stated to Cointelegraph:\n \u201cIf they have zero payment fees, than means only that fees are included in their internal exchange rate. One way or another, but fees are always there\u201d. \n\nWho is the Best?\nCryptonator is not the first service that allows users to pay bills with Bitcoin. 7pay.in has operated for three years already, offering its customers both a Bitcoin exchange and a service to pay internet and mobile phone bills. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe peculiarity of 7pay.in is that they don\u2019t hold customers\u2019 Bitcoins which provides additional safety.

He told Cointelegraph:\n \u201cMaximum of what we do is we keep the change from transactions on client\u2019s balance and add that to the next payment\u201d. \nThe other interesting thing about 7pay.in is that people can view all processed operation statistics on the site which adds additional transparency. Besides, there\u2019s no need for registration procedures or passwords which provides more simplicity.\nSuch Services aren\u2019t Designed for Common Users\nHowever, Russian experts stay rather sceptical about such services as they think they are not designed for users that are unfamiliar with Bitcoin. It can be a useful option for those who already use and trust in Bitcoin but it\u2019s not enough to attract users from outside the industry.\nAccording to Dima Vollo, developer of BitcoinFamily.org, Russia, \u201csuch services should offer something that would attract ordinary users, they should make Bitcoin payments simple, cheaper and more convenient than traditional payments as most users will prefer the way of payment which involves only several mouse clicks\u201d. He told Cointelegraph:\n \u201cThe main mistake of such services is that they are oriented on the customers that \u00a0already use cryptocurrency. And that is the direct way to failure. If they want to succeed in a long-term prospect, they should offer obvious advantages of crypto payments over traditional payments.

How much impact have these changes and FinTech advancements had on her neighbours within the West African subregion? How dependent on Nigeria are its neighbours, considering future technological improvements?\nWhile delivering her speech after a meeting with the President and Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria at the Presidential Villa in Abuja, the Chairperson of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde emphasised how dependent on Nigeria her neighbours are. According to Ms. Lagarde:\n \u201dNigeria is one of those countries that actually has an impact not just on itself and its people, but also around it and its neighbours.\u201d \nFinancial experts have easily agreed with Ms. Lagarde, and are also of the opinion that the slow pace of most FinTech developments in the West African subregion is directly related to the fact that the Nigerian market is yet to become fully captured.\n\nBloggers\u2019 view on IMF\u2019s position\nAmang Saliyuk is an SEO Consultant and blogger. In his analysis, Amang states that one major reason why Nigerian issues directly affect the entire region is due to the relative size of her economy. He says:\n \u201cAs the largest economy in Africa it invariably means that everything that happens in Nigeria affects its neighbours and it's people.\u201d \nSpeaking further, Mr.Saliyuk elaborated on areas of technological advancements that have been achieved in Nigeria and its impact on both her immediate society and that of her neighbours. He says:\n \u201cFrom a financial purview using 1999 till today as a timeline I'll say the Nigerian financial services sector has not only been very receptive to new technologies but has also been a trailblazer in technological development within the country. Using the banking industry as an example, Nigerian banks have come a long way from the days of analogue banking systems to a more friendly digital banking model that has given birth to a whole new realm of opportunities for Nigeria, her citizens and her neighbours. With the advent of card services in the banking sector a lot of businesses have been birthed which in turn created jobs and opportunities for Nigerians. Services like online retailing, Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) registration, interbank transfers and a whole lot of other opportunities. The rise of financial technologies also coincides with the growth of the telecoms sector which acts as a service provider to the financial sector. A whole new subsector of financial/telecoms startup companies have sprung up to offer support/outsourcing services to the banking/telecoms giants and by doing so creating jobs and value to the economy and creating a huge market for international organisations especially those resident within the neighbouring countries. We see Nigerian companies expanding to other African countries and the need to repatriate monies to their host countries has led to Nigerian banks and other financial institutions expanding to such countries to offer services to businesses of Nigerian origin. As these banks open up shops in diaspora and beyond they export their expertise and technologies to their host countries and recreate the same scenarios created in Nigeria with a ripple effect that trickles down to the micro-economy.\u201d \nAmang concluded by stating that like previous technological developments, the Blockchain technology will eventually be deployed in Nigeria but not any time soon. He said:\n \u201cBlockchain technology sooner or later would be embraced by the Nigerian systems, but I don't see it being deployed in the industry any time soon because of the technological deficiencies in Africa and the lack of the political will from the government.\u201d \n\nFinancial services\u2019 attitude\nBabatunde Ajayi is the Team Lead, Corporate Finance at Investment One Financial Services Limited.

Who needs a money transfer service, when you can just download an app?\nWith Bitcoin being around for a few years now, one would have expected remittance services to begin to adopt it for their own business, but somehow this didn\u2019t happen.\nMeanwhile, the Bitcoin software ecosystem keeps expanding, and another killer app seems to be on the horizon.\nFreemit\nFreemit is an app due for release in 2016 that will allow users to send fiat money abroad using the Bitcoin blockchain. John Biggs left \u201cthe best job ever\u201d, Chief Editor at TechCrunch, to become CEO of this project.\nFreemit will automatically \u201ctranslate\u201d local currency into Bitcoin and then back into the destination country\u2019s local currency in a completely transparent way to the user.\n \u201cUsing the blockchain and a local currency in/local currency out vision, we will make moving money cheaper, better, and friction-free.\u201d \n\nIn other words, you could send $100 from the USA to your brother in Japan, and have that money immediately transferred and converted into the japanese Yen equivalent of $100.\nThat\u2019s a 0% commission we are talking about, here.\n \u201cMoney transfer and exchange have not changed at all in the past 100 years. New blockchain-enabled technology makes money transfers instant and free. We are using this technology to eliminate the inefficiencies in the system.\u201d \nOn top of that, the transaction happens in minutes: the average Bitcoin transfer time.\nRemittance System, Bancomat and Debit Card\nAs Freemit users will fund their accounts with money or Bitcoin, the same app will allow them to use the app like a debit card, and spend those funds in affiliated shops.\nAnd at the same time, Bitcoins can be converted into any FIAT currency at \u201cthe best possible rates\u201d when users are abroad, if in need of cash.\nNot So Fast\nThere must be a reason if remittances are still alive and Bitcoin didn\u2019t set foot for good in this sector yet, despite its innumerable advantages.\nOne of the points of power of remittance services is that they don\u2019t ask for a bank account. People can just go into the venue, give cash and then the transmission is scheduled. An app cannot compete with this. A large number of people use remittances exactly because of this feature: they don\u2019t have a bank account and they want to send money home, or to their sons. When it\u2019s time, they just enter the venue with their cash and it\u2019s done.\nThis is something Bitcoin will have a hard time to beat.\nSimon Dixon, CEO of BnkToTheFuture.com and Fund Manager at Bitcoin Capital, says that Bitcoin is only a menace to organizations like Western Union:\n \u201cWestern Union is not in the business of transferring money. They are in the business of storing money in many different currencies in many different locations so that when somebody wants to receive cash on one end they already have the cash on that end without having to incur any costs transferring money. Their cost of transferring money is very small as they have built large reserves of currency in many locations. Their cost is maintaining offline outlets and software for their clients that want to become brokers for Western Union. If Western Union used Bitcoin it would only educate their customers that peer to peer money transfers can be done cheaper without Western Union in the future. Western Union has nothing to gain from using Bitcoin, but everything to lose from others using Bitcoin.\u201d \n\nAbout smaller remittance services, Simon thinks that it only needs time for them to adopt it:\n \u201cOther remittance services that are not holding large cash reserves and genuinely transfer money between countries will be using Bitcoin software to make their remittances in the future. BnkToTheFuture is looking to close investments in this sector at the moment as we believe there will be a large business case here in the future. At the moment the global Bitcoin markets are not liquid enough to keep the costs really low when converting fiat to Bitcoin and back again in more exotic currencies, but they will be as more reliable liquid exchanges come to market in the future for every currency.\u201d \nEric Grill, a Bitcoin ATM manager from the USA working in cryptocurrencies for years now, says:", "birthday": "2016-01-13T09:15:00+00:00", "date": "2016-01-13 09:15:00", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 13}

Since that time banks started treating Bitcoin suspiciously and ceased opening accounts for Bitcoin businesses.\nOnly five companies are allowed to continue operating as Bitcoin exchanges. These are the only companies that FSA is listening to. Considering the current situation, in the next 18 months there will be no new Bitcoin entering the market. It will take time to change that. That is the general situation of Bitcoin businesses in Japan.\nCT: What are the main prospects of Blockchain adoption among banks in Japan?\nTA: At the moment, Mijin is the biggest Blockchain-based private platform. We have already introduced our Blockchain product in September last year but banks didn\u2019t pay any attention to it.\nThere is no Blockchain technology here in Japan because we are the most conservative country and have the most conservative government in the world. So banks didn\u2019t even imagine they were going to use Blockchain distributed ledger system.\nI talked to the banks but still they all were looking to see \u00a0who\u2019s going to adopt the technology first. Then, finally, this month Sumishin SBI net bank officially announced it was going to do the experiment with Blockchain. It was in December and it was in the news. So everyone started jumping to the Blockchain.\nFinally, Japanese banks started watching Blockchain market.\nBut still, most people have little trust in Bitcoin. Until recent times all the news and headlines about Bitcoin were negative and offensive. That\u2019s why people tend to think all Bitcoin people and Bitcoin companies are criminals after the major Japanese media has published the headline about \u201cHead of Bitcoin being arrested\u201d.\nFortunately, people happen to have more trust in blockchain technology. I\u2019ve talked with several Japanese public companies about testing Blockchain technology and they were interested in that.\nIt\u2019s good that I\u2019ve managed to contribute to the development of Bitcoin companies and to make their names clean in the market. So people got interested in Blockchain and Bitcoin. The change took place in the last 30 days or so.\n\nCT: Is your market open for foreign companies to enter the Japanese market? Is there any interest from foreign companies to enter the Japanese market of Blockchain and Bitcoin? Are there any connections in the reverse direction? I mean are there any Japanese companies that want to enter the European or the US markets?\nTA: It would be difficult for foreign countries to settle in Japan. As I\u2019ve said, we are a very conservative country. So it\u2019s hard to do business in this country. Japanese companies are difficult to work with. It\u2019s extremely hard even to sign a contract. To enter our market, the company has to be big like Google. Otherwise Japanese companies would simply not listen to you.\nIf we talk about the reverse direction, I think it\u2019s going to be Mijin. We plan to start doing that in February. Currently, no one else is trying to go out of Japan because, for example, for Bitcoin exchanges it\u2019s like red auction market. Japanese companies have difficulties in going abroad just the same as foreign companies have difficulties in going to Japan.\nAnd concerning Blockchain \u2013 there are no other companies that have original Blockchain technology here in Japan.\nCT: How many companies from traditional space pay attention to Blockchain and Bitcoin space at the moment? How many companies from that space want to enter Blockchain market in Japan except the banks?", "birthday": "2016-01-11T11:15:00+00:00", "date": "2016-01-11 11:15:00", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 11}

Could the Blockchain be the ultimate solution to preventing mass data hacking?\nThe Blockchain is seen as the main technological innovation of Bitcoin. It is a public ledger of all bitcoin transactions that have ever been executed.\nThe Blockchain is basically an authentication technology as every transaction is open for verification by every participant of this distributed ledger. Whether the Blockchain can be employed to tackle the problems of identity and data theft over the internet is yet to be verified.\nBlockchain can be a part of the system\nVitalik Buterin is the founder of Ethereum, \u00a0a decentralized platform for applications that run exactly as programmed without any chance of fraud, censorship or third-party interference.

Vitalik said:\n \u201cBlockchains are NOT a privacy solution. They are an authenticity solution.

The collapse of stock markets and halts to trading there will have two contravailing reactions: a) traders will seek to move assets into something more portable and tradable outside chinese markets, like btc, and b) traders who have taken losses in regular securities will seek to liquidate btc to make up for those losses. In the US, we see Obama jumping on new activism in dictatorial actions on gun control, while Wall Street is falling due to fallout from the Chinese situation. People are reacting to both by a new rise in Gold, Silver, and BTC as well as newer scarce metals like platinum and rhodium that are also industrially useful as catalysts. Just as the precious metals have catalytic properties, btc is rising as its utility as a catalyst for smart contracts is becoming more evident with useful tools that enable that\u201d.

{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/dash-young-cryptocurrency-with-an-interesting-story", "title": " DASH: Young Cryptocurrency With An Interesting Story ", "content": "Despite its youth, the DASH cryptocurrency has a history full of events. The project was launched on January 18, 2014 as XCoin. Considerable interest in this new currency arose from the start and this was caused because mining of XCoins was possible even with the graphic processors of videocards while mining of Litecoin and Bitcoin on CPU and GPU stopped being the profitable a long ago. Of course, cryptocurrencies that can be mined on CPU and GPU, both then and now exist but XCoin differed favorably from any of them.\nThe times of XCoin\nThe combination of 11 cryptographic algorithms (blake, bmw, groestl, jh, keccak, skein, luffa, cubehash, shavite, simd, echo) became the base algorithm of Xcoin. A short abbreviation of all of them was called X11. Only by breaking all 11 algorithms would give hackers a chance to seize power over the network. It made Xcoin a safer system in comparison with cryptocurrencies which use only one algorithm (like Bitcoin\u2019s SHA-256 and Litecoin\u2019s Scrypt algorithms).\nMoreover Xcoin provided a high speed of transactions. The speed of confirmation of the transaction, 2.5 minutes (similar as with Litecoin), is favorably differed in comparison with Bitcoin with its 10 minutes or more to confirm the transaction.\nMiners liked XCoin because of its high efficiency algorithm that saved electric power and mining equipment. In general, it had many technical innovations but still, Xcoin received lots of criticism. Especially because of an unnoticed bug in the code that allowed some early miners to get a huge reward. In only 48 hours they received 1.9 million coins, or about 30% of the whole volume today. And the next year the miner with one hundred thousand Xcoin became a Dollar millionaire.\nTimes of Darkcoin\nJust 10 days after the start of the project on January 28, 2014, Xcoin was rebranded into Darkcoin. The whole negative information about the unevenness of distribution of Xcoin remained in the past, and thanks to the unique DarkSend function the Darkcoin cryptocurrency soon gained considerable popularity.\nBitcoin isn't anonymous at all, users must use additional services to ensure anonymity. While the function of Darkcoin that allowed it to mask transactions and IP addresses of participants of a network is built into the cryptocurrency. It became possible exactly because of the DarkSend algorithm. And it received a huge demand. For 2014 the price of Darkcoin made a considerable jump, and Darkcoin got in the TOP-5 of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world.\n\nThe trades began at the level of approximately $0.6 at the end of February, 2014, and until the end of April the price didn't exceed $1. But then it jumped to $2, got a small kickback, and reached $14 by the end of May.\nThe Darkcoin price kept its positions at the levels over $10 for not long, and then began falling just as fast to the level of $1.6 in August. Until the end of 2014 the price of Darkcoin fluctuated from $1.6 to $3.2 with a tendency to decrease. 2015 too began at the level of $1.6.\nDASH era\nOn March 25, 2015 developers changed the name Darkcoin to Dash (short for \"digital cash\"). The renaming was made to avoid associations with the underground markets and shadow business, and also to attract a wider audience. The developers plan succeeded and DASH began its ascension. Now many supporters of DASH see this cryptocurrency as a good alternative to Bitcoin.\nThe InstantX technology, which appeared in the fall of 2014, at the time of Darkcoin, makes payments instant (thus it charges an additional small fee). However, even by taking into account incomparably higher speed, commission charges when using DASH are tens times less, than when using Bitcoin.", "birthday": "2016-01-13T15:38:00+00:00", "date": "2016-01-13 15:38:00", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 13}

Currently the level of resistance is about $430 and buyers can not overcome this level. However, sellers can not seize the initiative at the moment either. Market players are waiting and are in no hurry to open long or short positions.\nIt seems that the price of Bitcoin should soon break upward to the range of $440 - $450. The reason for this is the beginning of the year, when investors try to form their investment portfolio. The US Dollar, \u00a0Bitcoin's main competitor, is now under pressure because of the weak economic data coming from the US. The index of activity in the manufacturing sector, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) revealed yesterday to be at the level of 48.2, which is its lowest level since June 2009. Decline in business activity in the manufacturing sector suggests a reduction in US GDP, as well as placing the Dollar under pressure. Bitcoin has, on the contrary, big prospects for growth in 2016. We asked experts again, if we can expect the price of Bitcoin to rise to $500 by the end of January? And got the following answers:\nMike Lorrey from USA, the co-creator of cryptocurrency Galactic and cryptocurrency BitGold:\n \u201cYes, it appears that UK PM David Cameron\u2019s recent statements that unless taxes are raised significantly, the only way to meet budget demands will be to confiscate savings in bank accounts, has motivated a number of UK persons to begin looking seriously at bitcoin as a means of shielding their savings from the tax man. If bitcoin is accepted to even a minor extent in the UK as a major means of storing savings, this could result in a significant and permanent uptick in the price of bitcoin. The problem, of course, is that the UK govt may make it difficult for persons to transfer funds to companies providing bitcoin services, or the govt may start collecting bitcoin wallet keys of UK residents in order to track the bitcoin savings of UK residents and citizens, and to impose seizure orders\u201d. \nVishal Gupta is the Founder of Bitcoin Alliance India, CEO at SearchTrade, and Director at Moving Trumpet:\n \u201cIt seems Market is factoring in halving of bitcoin in advance and we could see price rising as far as 600 to 700 before July.

Basically we are creating booking.com or expedia.com of Bitcoin but we don't accept any other currency except Bitcoin.\nCT: What kind of hotels will you have available for booking?\nKP: We have 40 hotels which we can list at the launch. It will be in USA mainly.\nCT: Will it be available worldwide?\nKP: Yes, it will be available once we get hotels listed. mostly in Europe and india. I am getting in touch with people in Italy , France and London. This is one project which we are starting as a fair trade. we will not hide anything from the customer as well we don't do business to make money ourself at the cost of hotel owner.\nCT: You said 40 hotels, are they already available? How can a person start using your service?\nKP: Right now it is not available since we are testing. Once we are done testing then it will be available. Right now we need to reach out to the Bitcoin community to get some users signed up, so we can make our case to hotels to convince them to enroll with us. We are not just unique because we accept Bitcoin but we are unique because we will allow people to price thieir own price and get instant offer match. We will allow group booking prices online and also meeting rooms will be bookable online. We will also have an event planning tool so you can create an event and invite guests who are needing hotel room while attending events and we have a split payment tool. You can book for a group and \u00a0we send payment link to each member to pay their own share. So it is more then just booking with bitcoin\nCT: Why have you started this project?\nKP: Since I am a hotel owner myself I started this project. When I learnt about bitcoin I liked it so much and I wanted to accept bitcoin for my two hotels but my webmaster told us \u201cNo\u201d. So I was looking for other platform to add my hotel could not find so i started BookWithBit.\nCT: So your hotel(s) will be the first in the list? Which is the hotel you own?\nKP: Green Country Inn of Heavener,\u00a0Motel 6 tulsa, and many hotels owned by my close family as well.\nCT: What are the fees for you service?\nKP: 5% fees will be paid by guest and 5% paid by hotel. So our commission is only 10%.\nCT: Are there any similar services accepting cryptocurrency?\nKP: We know Expedia is offering Bitcoin bookings but they are not promoting Bitcoin nor passing savings to hotel or hotel guests.

Cointelegraph asked Daniel Dabek, founder and core developer of Safe Exchange.\nA lot of crypto-developers write to \u0421oinTelegraph willing to share their amazing stories of meeting and working with cryptocurrencies. Today our guest is Daniel Dabek, \u00a0Founder and core developer of Safex.\nWhen he first saw the Safe Network in June 2014 upon meeting Paige Peterson, who does work for MaidSafe, he realised that this platform was going to be very important. So he knew that making a start-up would be feasible, and he had initially ignored and steered clear of situations that would lead him into an employment position.\nDaniel had a small success in trading CitiBank shares, when he became acquainted with Bitcoin in Mexico. But he applied his expertise only in San Francisco. Shortly after arriving there, he discovered MaidSafe and the Safe Network. Projects that could use his expertise in the needs of Wall Street traders.\nCointelegraph: Former CitiBank shares trader is solving a problem, how to avoid the CIA\u2019s spying in China and USA to keep privacy and secrets in business. How is it possible?\nDaniel Dabek: Yes, that is a part of it. With privacy in users\u2019 hands first, and instantaneous transfer of cryptographic payloads (coins) it reduce the threat layer that people are exposed to. Transparency is dependent on the parties involved; and the level of transparency would be well known in advance. If someone wants to know my address for shipping, the only way to get it is to ask for it. In today\u2019s internet system and how things work, The IP address and undisclosed metadata compromises people\u2019s safety, their digital data\u2019s safety and the physical safety of people and their data. This is how people and organizations are exposed, the door in is wide open through purely digital means\n \u201cIf you give a merchant your physical address, and no one else, and later you are attacked on your home computers it would be reasonable to commit that as investigatory evidence that merchant collected your information.\u201d \nCointelegraph: Tell us a little about your project. What is its purpose?\nDD: Certainly, Safe Exchange is a digital contract marketplace that lets people create a cryptographic version of an underlying thing and be able to transfer it by message or through sale. Since it is built using the Safe Network as a backend the whole process takes place without a centralized party handling the clearing of the transaction. People clear their contracts directly with each other. Additionally, since there is no open ledger to the Safe Network people\u2019s transactions are anonymous to outsiders, and only known to the participants involved. In no way can the service or the network determine any level of information that will be compromising by attacking the software itself.\nThis means that people could offer to sell anything that they choose without having their geographic location disclosed. For example: if you bought something with your credit card, and you ordered to your office but you used the website to make your purchase from home.. well you lost your obfuscation there and now the merchant knows where your home is. By the same token Bitcoin also has a drawback though watch this: if I bought something from amazon and shipped it to my office to protect my home address, and I did it from home. Now the merchant knows where I sent bitcoins from, how many I have, where I live, and where I\u2019m going with the coins in the future.\n\nCT: Do you think that the Internet will gradually be decentralized?\nDD: I think that the internet is already decentralized except it has been tailored to aggregate its traffic into central hubs where the majority of the nodes of the internet are owned by controlled entities therefore centralizing the information of the internet;\nI think that the internet will need a modification in the way it routes ALL data, and at least when it goes through the centralized hubs the data is not exposed to them (in other words the data is encrypted and the keys are inaccessible to the hub masters). This will protect people, and also I think make internet hub formation less lucrative. I think of 1 trillion dollars asset AT&T - with solutions like bitcoin it introduced that people will run their computer at home and maintain the network. It used to be that people ran ISPs from garages. We need some of that again, and we see that in the decentralized space with mining; but I also think that we need to be agnostic to the data and the purpose of data that is being transmitted.\nCT: What if I have a great trade secret?

Blockchain\u2019s charts page is a good source of data, reflecting a large part of the market, and the last month has seen a further boost in the parabolic curve of wallets registration.\nNow at around 12000 new wallets created each day on Blockchain.info alone, and with similar numbers confirmed by Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, it\u2019s time to see what this number really means.\n7th Year Of Bitcoin\nThe year 2015 is the seventh in Bitcoin\u2019s life, and that year is coming to an end, as Bitcoin\u2019s genesis block was mined on the 3rd of January 2009. This year has seen a lot of events, while the price fluctuated between 200 and 300 USD, the number of transactions is ever increasing, with more than double the volume in the last three months, but one of the most interesting trends is the number of new wallets that are being opened every day. Arguably a better thermometer for Bitcoin adoption can be found, but how reliable is it? How many of those wallets are real?\n100 Million By 2020\nIn the graph below, the blue line represents actual data from the Blockchain.info website My Wallets page, while the orange line represents its future development with the actual trend. At the moment, there have been around 5 millions wallets opened.\n\nOnce cleaned of a couple of bumps due to critical moments like the MtGox affair, that brought a lot of advertising on the mainstream media, the graph shows a curve that is clearly growing in a geometric progression fashion.\nIf the actual trend persists, a hundred million wallets registered by 2020 is in sight, which predicts that the entrance of Bitcoin into the mainstream is nearer than most people expect. And these numbers only apply to a single operator, albeit one of the largest. Together with Coinbase wallets, and all the more from other operators, the clients installed and smartphones apps, 100 million really just looks like the minimum we\u2019ll have by 2020.\nBut how many of these wallets correspond to real people?\n2015 Just A Passage Point, A Lot To Be Done\nCointelegraph asked\u00a0Bitcoin.com\u00a0supervisor and\u00a0Blockchain.info\u00a0angel investor himself, Roger Ver, who is already part of Bitcoin history, what is his vision of the future of Bitcoin and if this trend is the final mark to its entrance into the mainstream.\nCointelegraph: What do you think about this number, about these 12000 wallets created every day? The projection of the single Blockchain.info wallets chart leads to somewhere around 100 million wallets by 2020. Bitcoin seems to be going to reach the Moon sooner than most expected.\nRoger Ver: 12,000 wallets per day is amazing, but we need to grow even faster than that. If you are are reading this, and are a fan of Bitcoin, and the positive changes it will bring to the world, \u00a0it is your job to tell your friends and family. Set them all up with a Bitcoin wallet for the new year, and teach them how to use Purse.io or Foldapp.com\nCT: Even though I am very happy with this trend, this number looks a bit off reality to me: I don\u2019t see an increase in Bitcoin chatter in forums, initiatives, and such, that should obviously reflect this number. Do you think there\u2019s a considerable number of people opening more than one wallet? Is there any way to know if different wallets belong to the same person? For example, by checking the IP address when a new user is registering. Are you doing that at Blockchain?\nRV: I\u2019m sure lots of people have more than one wallet, \u00a0but I\u2019m also sure that thousands or tens of thousands of new people are signing up for Bitcoin wallets for the first time every single day.\nWith amazing reasons like 20% off everything from Amazon via Purse.io or 20% off every Starbucks thanks to foldapp.com, it would be more surprising if tens of thousands of people weren\u2019t signing up each day.\n\nCT: Could it make sense for a single person to create more than one wallet? What advantage could they receive from this practice?\nRV: I think lots of people have multiple Bitcoin wallets just like they have multiple bank accounts. \u00a0I don\u2019t think this is abnormal in any way.\nCT: This page sports a interesting examination of the number of wallets, and the conclusion is that a large number of the wallets do not represent single users but are opened for different reasons, like wallet shuffling, laundering and coin mixing. What is your point of view?\nRV: I think this chart is a lot more informative:\u00a0\n\nThe fees are real money that real people are willing to pay in order to use Bitcoin.\nWe have seen somewhere in the ballpark of a hundred times growth in this metric over the last two years.\nFrom about one hundred dollars a day in fees, to over ten thousand today.\nIf real people weren\u2019t using bitcoin for real commerce, they wouldn\u2019t be willing to pay the ten thousand dollars in fees each and every day.\nCT: I have recently read that 80% of Bitcoins are bought in Yuan. Speculation is that the Chinese population is buying Bitcoin to bypass government restrictions to limit capital migration from the country. Do you see any political implication in this fact?", "birthday": "2016-01-05T14:45:00+00:00", "date": "2016-01-05 14:45:00", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 5}

Staring in disbelief, a lot of traders sold their coin on April 10, 2013 at $4.49. Probably, those who sold their Litecoin on March 2-3, 2013 at the price of $0.07 - $0.09 were very upset.\nAlmost during the whole of 2013 Litecoin was falling from the top of $4.49, and by October, 2013, one Litecoin was priced at $1.7-$2.

Too bad January 1 has begun with a terrible headache and nausea. Seems familiar, doesn\u2019t it? I bet it is! Of course, Cointelegraph believes our readers have the sense of proportion as it is actually the best way to avoid a hangover, but if you did find yourself feeling terrible on the morning of January 1, we can help you find a cure or, at the very least, ease your suffering.\nFirst of all, there is no such thing as a hangover remedy. All medicines with such a label mostly appear ineffective. More worryingly, they can even make you feel worse. A good option is to take an enterosorbent before you start drinking, such as charcoal. It will absorb alcohol and save you from intoxication. But you can\u2019t always know in advance when will you start a drinking session.\nThere are many ways to fight a hangover, and most of them are not connected to medicines at all. For example, Medical Daily recommends drinking water or eating asparagus as the \u201camino acids in asparagus improve the speed of how human cells break down alcohol, which can prevent some of the long-term damage from alcohol\u2019s toxic byproducts, such as hydrogen peroxide\u201d.\nMen\u2019s Health recommends eating crackers or toast or even have sex, though \u201cthere is no scientific research that shows that sex will make a hangover go away\u201d. However, you can actually ease your pain with the usual painkillers like aspirin or ibuprofen. And if you are too lazy to go to the pharmacy yourself, you could use your Bitcoins and order your remedy with delivery. Here are four pharmacies that accept Bitcoins:\nSwiss Online Pharmacy\nThis company operates from the Seychelles and India. Swiss Online Pharmacy guarantees the quality of their goods and 100% security. They ship to nearly every country of the world. Though, you\u2019ll definitely need to order your medicine in advance as shipping takes from 8 to 21 working days.\nThey only offer generic drugs which are distributed without patent protection. They differ from brand name drugs slightly so you should read the information table on the web site before ordering.\nCanada Bitcoin Pharmacy\nThis is the first Bitcoin only pharmacy ever, which allows you to buy medicines via your account at Coinbase, Circle, or LocalBitcoins. They also have a delivery option though it is not stated which countries they actually ship to. Delivery usually takes 2-3 weeks, but for EMS shipping it takes 5-10 business days.\nThey have quite a good assortment of medicine though there are only a few kinds of painkillers. But you\u2019ll definitely be able to buy Viagra if you decide to take that advice from Men\u2019s Health.\nJCM Pharmacy\nJCM Pharmacy was established in 1962 in Singapore. So, as you can see, the company has quite a long history. Now, they have over 45 pharmacies operating in India, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. \u00a0\u00a0Besides those, they also have shipping centers in 4 countries: Singapore, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and their main shipping center in Mumbai, India.\nJCM Pharmacy offers a good range of medicines of different kinds so you will definitely find something to help you there. The only bad thing is that the shipping will also take some time - 15-20 mailing days.", "birthday": "2016-01-02T11:45:00+00:00", "date": "2016-01-02 11:45:00", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 2}
{"url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-bitcoin-price-changes", "title": " Why Bitcoin Price Changes? ", "content": "Both Bitcoin buyers and sellers attention on the market is always focused on the cryptocurrency price. This is a defining factor that empowers traders to makes decisions on whether to buy or sell Bitcoins. Every day, experts make forecasts about the price based on fundamental or technical analysis and market players are closely following any news that may affect the price and value of Bitcoin. In this article we will try to understand what factors affect the growth or decline of Bitcoin price rates. But first, let us recall what represents the price of Bitcoin.\nBitcoin has value for several reasons:\n Bitcoin is money and an alternative to fiat money. Bitcoin has all the features that are inherent in money - it is divisible, durable, recognizable and most importantly, it is accepted as a payment. Unlike fiat money or gold, Bitcoin has no physical embodiments and is not backed by physical items but rather it has a mathematical and technical basis. People trust in this currency and this trust is increasing. Bitcoin is already a common means of payment among its users, and its acceptance ia spreading fast too. The cost of Bitcoin is determined by its users, and only by them. \nFactors that affect the price\nNow let's try to find out what factors affect the growth of the Bitcoin price. The price of any currency or commodity, as it is known, is determined by supply and demand.\nThe first factor that affects the price of Bitcoin, in our opinion, is its limitations, both in quantity and in production time. The total number of Bitcoins has long been known \u2013 only 21 million. Thus, the time at which newly created or mined Bitcoins will be available is predictable, and the production rate is decreasing. This factor has a positive impact on Bitcoin and contributes to its growth.\nThe second factor is the belief in the price of Bitcoin rising to unlimited levels: $ 10,000, $ 1,000,000 and above.\nThe third factor is the use of Bitcoin as a payment system to transfer money from one point to another.\nThe fourth factor is the trust of the people. In recent years, more and more people are interested in cryptocurrency and tend to buy it. More and more companies and merchants accept Bitcoin as a means of payment. This factor also contributes to the growth of Bitcoin.\nThe fifth factor is the recognition of Bitcoin as a means of payment and investment in it by different governments. As well as growing legal acceptance, regulation and the acquiring of official status in countries worldwide.\nThe sixth factor contributing to the strengthening of Bitcoin\u2019s price is its independence from the macroeconomic indicators of the leading countries of the world. Their national currencies are fluctuating due to the quality of state statistics, but such news has almost no effect on the Bitcoin price.", "birthday": "2016-01-02T14:00:00+00:00", "date": "2016-01-02 14:00:00", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 2}

It is very easy - the system helps claim property rights to the pieces of arts that are very difficult to forge. Perhaps, that\u2019s why 2015 was rich with art projects applying Bitcoin and the Blockchain.\nCointelegraph talked to Masha McConaghy PhD, a curator and co-founder of the Berlin-based startup, Ascribe, that works in the arts industry. She outlined some of the most interesting art projects of 2015 that use Blockchain technology, saying that \u201c2016 will be an interesting year\u201d. She added:\n \u201cIn the physical art world there is a great need in clean provenance. Here where blockchain technology will play an important role. In Germany, especially after the discovery of Gurlitt Collection the Provenance research became the most important topic. The unregulated art market is in need for transparency and regulation and blockchain can dress a lot of issues\u201d. \u00a0 \n\nLeft Gallery\nIt is a digital gallery, launched by the successful Dutch, Berlin-based artist Harm van den Dorpel. The project helps artists selling their works which are \u201cdownloadable objects\u201d. Left Gallery uses Bitcoin as a payment option.\nIkonoTV\nIkonoTV is the first television channel broadcasting art 24/7 in HD. The channel collaborates with more than 1000 international artists, over 200 collections, archives and the most significant museums of the world. \u00a0IkonoTV is using the Blockchain to make sure their artists are properly attributed. The technology is also applied to signing contracts cryptographically so that copyrights are always clear. The channel reaches a viewing audience of more than 300 million people.\nCointemporary\nCointemporary is an online platform for exhibiting and selling artwork. The platform is dedicated to a single piece of art for 10 days, during which it is exhibited and can be sold for a fixed price in Bitcoins. After the work is sold or the 10 day period passes, the platform exhibits another piece of art for another 10 days. Cointemporary is a project by two Vienna-based artists, Valentin Ruhry and Andy Boot, that pioneered selling art for Bitcoin, and more recently blockchain-ascribed digital art. Masha McConaghy stated \u201cthey are going to dedicate the 2016 only to digital works\u201d.\nN3uro\nN3uro is a marketplace that sells thoughts. Literally. The platform captures brainwaves of people, and sells the recordings of those brainwaves as limited digital editions. Literally, they sell blockchain-ascribed brain scans. The official N3uro website states that \u201cthese limited digital editions are possible via a combination of copyright & contract law, and the bitcoin blockchain as an ownership registry\u201d.\nPlantoid", "birthday": "2016-01-03T12:25:00+00:00", "date": "2016-01-03 12:25:00", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 3}

What has Bitcoin brought to us last year? On the first day on the year 2015, January 01, 2015, the price of Bitcoin moved to the level of $313, which is 59.35% less than a year before that, on January 01, 2014, when the price was $770.\nDuring the first two weeks of 2015 the price of Bitcoin dropped sharply to $177. The price then rose gradually to $250 in September and had moved to another top of $300 by the end of October. The maximum price in 2015 we saw in December 2015, when the Bitcoin price was approaching a level of $480. However, on New Year\u2019s Eve investors decided to take their profit and the price of Bitcoin has now dropped to $430.\nAs we have seen, in 2015 Bitcoin had to deal with a lot of factors that influenced the cryptocurrency\u2019s volatility and price. However, in 2015 the daily volume of transactions reached new levels as Bitcoin approached world famous payment systems, such as Western Union and PayPal. Bitcoin\u2019s transaction fee is relatively lower than most other payment systems. The volume of investments in US Dollar in 2015 increased to $469 million. More than one hundred thousand companies worldwide are now accepting Bitcoin as payment. Therefore, despite all the difficulties that the cryptocurrency had to face in 2015, Bitcoin confidently holds its position and is firmly embedded in our daily lives.\n\nThe year 2016\nIn 2016, with some confidence we can say that Bitcoin will continue to grow. One reason for this is the two-time reduction of new Bitcoin coming into the market. According to the Bitcoin algorithm the reward for confirming one block is reduced twice every four years. And the year 2016 is one such year. In addition, the growing popularity of Bitcoin as a means of payment for goods will lead to an increase in its use. These two factors together will cause increased demand and a shortage of Bitcoin in the market.\nAccording to Tone Vays, Head of Research at BraveNewCoin, the bullish trend of Bitcoin will be restored in the 3rd quarter of 2016, but has not ruled out a rollback to the level of $300. We asked Patrick Dugan from USA - CFO at Omni Foundation about when to expect a recovery of the bullish trend on Bitcoin, too. According to him:\n \u201cWe're in the eye of the storm of an extremely bullish wave that will eclipse the previous one before going into an even larger triangle consolidation between $600 and $350.\u201d \nLet\u2019s now take a look at the major competitors of Bitcoin. In our opinion, they are the US Dollar, Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan and Gold. This time oil will not be considered due to the collapse of its price.\nDollar\nThe US Dollar is the strongest and the main competitor of Bitcoin. Despite December's decline, the Dollar has managed to finish the year 2015 with a growth of 9 percent against other major currencies. Last year, the dollar has shown the maximum growth of the last 10-15 years. According to experts at the big banks, the Dollar will continue to grow in 2016 as well. So, Bitcoin will always feel the pressure of the Dollar.\nEuro\nThe second most important currency in the world and the main competitor of the Dollar is the Euro. It has a leading position as one of the major reserve currencies. The Euro is considered to be a funding currency. \u00a0This means that European banks use this currency to raise funds in order to ensure their core business. Previously, this function was performed by the Dollar. Such status has a positive effect on the Euro and makes it a sort of safe sanctuary. However, forecasts for the Euro price in 2016 are disappointing. By year end, the EUR/USD exchange rates could come close to a level of 0.95.\nBritish Pound\nSince 2006, the Pound returned itself to a status of reserve currency and became the third largest among the world's currencies. An especially noticeable rise in popularity of pounds is seen in recent years. In 2016, the British Pound will be under pressure from the Dollar, due to the reduction of the budget of England and the constant threat of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. Moreover, the Bank of England continually postpones rate hikes, which adversely affects the Pound. Next year, we will clearly see the decrease to 1.4 and maybe even 1.3.", "birthday": "2016-01-04T14:06:00+00:00", "date": "2016-01-04 14:06:00", "year": 2016, "month": 1, "day": 4}

In fact, it could hardly be called a market yet, as it consists of only a couple of enthusiasts working hard to promote Bitcoin and the Blockchain among the Kazakh people. Recently the first Bitcoin ATM was installed in Kazakhstan and in 2016 Kazakh enthusiasts plan to create a Bitcoin Foundation in the country.\nBoris Komarov is such enthusiast and a head of the First Bitcoin Center in Kazakhstan. He told Cointelegraph about the current situation in the Kazakh crypto market and also shared his plans for further development of the market in 2016.\nCointelegraph: How many companies work in the Bitcoin industry at the present time? Are there any companies that accept Bitcoin payments?\nBoris Komarov: \u00a0There are several companies in the industry. And there are also 3 online shops and a lawful agency that accept Bitcoin payments. The First Bitcoin Center also accepts Bitcoin donations. You can check Bitcoin Map for more details.\nCT: What problems are faced by crypto companies in Kazakhstan? Is it difficult to solve those problems?\nBK: \u00a0Actually, there are no problems as there are only a few Bitcoin businesses in the country. Though, there is a Bitcoin ATM which could be considered as business as well. And that ATM\u2019s owner is obliged to pay a 3% tax to the government. It could not be called a serious problem but I don\u2019t really understand why it is taxed.\nThe owner has his interest in Bitcoins and Kazakh government has no proper regulations for cryptocurrency. Moreover, it has no clear status in the country\u2019s legislation. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to charge Bitcoin ATM without having defined its place by the law.\n\nCT: Could you summarise your achievements in developing the Kazakh crypto market in 2015?\nBK: We didn\u2019t have any significant achievements yet. Less than 0.1% of Kazakh people try to search any information about Bitcoin via search engines like Yandex or Google. We had some increased demand when people started applying to our Bitcoin Center but this could hardly be called a consistent progress. I think it was rather connected to some news than to increased interest.\nCT: What future do you see for the Kazakh crypto industry in 2016? Perhaps, do you have some plans or new projects to be launched in 2016?\nBK: I foresee the interest of local residents for cryptocurrency will be increased gradually in 2016. I plan to continue raising Bitcoin awareness among Kazakh people and consulting everyone who would like to have some guidance to Bitcoin. I consult people individually via email or Skype. I also train experts to hold Bitcoin meetups for local residents. \u00a0\u00a0\nI have another cryptocurrency-related project called Criptodengi. It has achieved quite a success as its geography isn\u2019t limited to Kazakhstan. The project is aimed at helping Russian speaking people raise their awareness about Bitcoin. In 2016 I plan to issue a series of Bitcoin tutorials which help people get learn about Bitcoin, mining, earning Bitcoins, investing in cryptocurrencies and other topics relevant for now. \u00a0\nI also plan to establish a venture fund to attract investments to Bitcoin startups, as well as for other players of the market.\nCT: And what about the government and banks?
