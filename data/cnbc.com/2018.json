Worldpay works with Coinbase to use Visa's network. Not all card issuers were affected by the issue of unauthorized transactions.San Francisco-based company Coinbase is the leading U.S. marketplace for buying and selling major cryptocurrencies.In the last few days, an increasing number of Coinbase users took to Reddit and other social media to complain about duplicate transaction charges that sometimes drained the bank account to zero, with overdraft fees.The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in a statement to CNBC Friday that  \"the CFTC is aware of customer complaints and is looking into this issue.\"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also said in a statement that,  \"We are aware of the reports, and expect companies to comply with all applicable laws regarding the treatment of consumers' funds. Consumers who find unauthorized charges in their bank account or credit card should contact their financial institution immediately.\"J.P. Morgan Chase did not respond to a CNBC request for comment. But the bank's support Twitter account said earlier this month, in a reply to a customer who complained about a  \"$5 non chase atm fee,\" that: \"The recent change to the way Coinbase transactions are processed is due to a reclassification between the merchant and Visa. Any cash-like transaction, such as this, will be assessed the cash advance fee. This is typically $5 or 5% of the charge.\"Wells Fargo declined to comment for this story.Bitcoin marketplace Coinmama, which also supports Visa, told CNBC Friday they have had no issues so far with payments on their platform.The impact of the issue Coinbase users were seeing appeared limited. CNBC reached out to more than 30 states where Coinbase is licensed to operate. Of the eight that responded, none of them reported an uptick in complaints against Coinbase.A spokesperson for the Alabama Securities Commission did point out that typically, complaints can take weeks to arrive at their office.

The performance brought bitcoin's three-day gains to more than 22 percent.Other top cryptocurrencies followed suit. XRP, the world's second largest digital currency, jumped 16 percent while ether rallied 13 percent, according to CoinDesk.Still, 2018 has been a horrible year for most cryptocurrency investors. Bitcoin is down more than 80 percent from its all-time high hit almost exactly one year ago. This year alone, it's down 72 percent and has struggled to attract new buyers.Finding fresh buyers was hardly a problem last year. Bitcoin first became a household name in 2017 as retail investors made speculative bets on cryptocurrencies, raising money through initial coin offerings. Regulators have stepped up their oversight of the industry this year, cracking down on fundraising projects that have failed to register with the SEC. Other crypto founders have been charged as outright frauds.Over the past six months, hundreds of the ICOs have been forced to close up shop, which CoinFi CEO Timothy Tam said was a necessary shakeout for the market. \"The garbage, or at least a good portion of it, is starting to get collected,\" Tam said. \"Ultimately this strengthens the market.\"Still, he underlined that a 10 percent bitcoin spike doesn't mean crypto prices are in the clear or that it's  \"time to breath a sign of relief.\" \"If anything, it proves speculation still dominates and most \u2014 not all, but most \u2014 are not trading in reality,\" Tam told CNBC, adding that he saw some institutional-level money flow into the markets over the last 48 hours. Tam said certain investors had been sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the market to find bottom. \"It's certainly a hell of a lot more cost efficient to buy now,\" he said. \"The hope is that the market has culled jumpy retail investors and, as regulators move in, we start to see some much needed stability.\"Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, said bitcoin's  \"impressive push from the floor\" on Wednesday was also the result of short covering. \"People are looking to reduce their exposure and closing out high-risk sell positions before the holidays, and this is creating upward pressure on market prices, which is ultimately resulting in a rally,\" Greenspan said.Michael Moro, CEO of Genesis Global Trading, also saw an uptick in short covering. He echoed Tam's sentiment that bitcoin is not quite out of the woods yet. Moro said he is not ready to call a bottom until prices break toward the $4,000 ceiling. \"Buyers typically need to see prices holding for a few days before they really step in, and I think $3,900 is a key short-term level here before that really happens,\" Moro told CNBC.By midday Wednesday, bitcoin surrendered some of the morning's gains. It was trading at $3,774.85.\n", "birthday": "2018-12-19T14:14:33+0000", "date": "2018-12-19 14:14:33", "year": 2018, "month": 12, "day": 19}

She is stepping down for person reasons, the company said in a statement, but will remain involved as a board member, strategic advisor and shareholder.The bitcoin mania of 2017 also brought attention to its underlying technology, blockchain. Masters and other Wall Street executives have praised the technology and its disruptive potential, and companies from Amazon to J. P. Morgan are exploring how to use it in their own lines of business. But most have stayed away from embracing cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin itself has tumbled more than 80 percent from its high near $20,000 last December, and was trading near $3,826 on Wednesday.Masters spent roughly two decades on Wall Street, most recently at J.P. Morgan as head of global commodities. She was a key pioneer behind the credit-default swap, a derivative designed for risk management that later took heat for being a toxic contributor to the 2008 financial crisis.In moving to blockchain, she was also a pioneer.

In fact, the number of new crypto job postings, as a percentage of all new job postings, peaked in early 2018 and has since been steadily on the decline.Utilizing AngelList's A-List platform to gauge interest in blockchain jobs, data shows about 40 percent of top job seekers listed blockchain among the industries they were most interested in joining in 2017, trailed by a drop-off in March 2018. Currently, just under 20 percent list blockchain as among their top three industries of professional interest. \"Many firms across the digital currency landscape hired aggressively throughout 2017 and early 2018 as the market rose, and it makes a ton of sense as to why firms are now having to downsize. It means that companies are making rational decisions, and not simply assuming that prices will recover in 2019,\" said Michael Moro, CEO of Genesis Global Trading, to CNBC.Another area of the digital currencies hemisphere \u2013 cryptocurrency hedge funds \u2013 are also feeling the pain.Matthew Stover, CEO of MG Stover, tracks data on crypto hedge funds. \"We had five [funds] that already closed and one more planning to close at year-end. So that would be 6 percent of our crypto funds,\" Stover told CNBC in an email.Stover pointed out that most of the funds that are closing had very little capital and posted poor performance this year.Despite the downturn in cryptocurrency prices, Stover is still expecting 12 new crypto funds to launch within the next couple of months.While the sell-off in digital currencies had made investing in this new asset class more challenging, it hasn't seemed to impact the larger funds like Polychain Capital and Blocktower Capital at this point.CNBC reached out to both companies and did not receive responses.Other funds like Morgan Creek Digital, which has $1 billion in assets under management, see the drop in cryptocurrency prices as an opportunity. \"While most people are going home or slowing down, we are getting more aggressive at Morgan Creek Digital. It is our belief that bear markets are the most attractive time to deploy capital or build companies.The work being done in the crypto industry today will pay off in prices and returns 2-3 years from now,\" said Anthony Pompliano, founder of Morgan Creek Digital, to CNBC.Institutional digital currency trading firm Genesis Global continues to expand. \"For Genesis specifically, we are continuing to grow even as the bear market lingers. In 2019, we are increasing head count in lending, technology, and operational support,\" says Moro.Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange, told CNBC it is also expecting to continue hiring in the new year. \"We've more than doubled our head count since June.

Bernstein | Reuters\nCongress may finally bring the cryptocurrency industry what it has been loudly calling for: regulatory clarity.Two congressmen are introducing a bill Thursday that would exclude digital currencies from the decades-old definition of a security. The legal definition might seem like an insignificant change, but it has become a heated issue for those in the industry who say the law is outdated for a digital asset class.The  \"Token Taxonomy Act\" \u2014 a bipartisan effort by Reps. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio and Darren Soto, D-Fla. \u2014 defines a \"digital token\" and clarifies that securities laws would not apply to cryptocurrencies once they become a fully functioning network. \"In the early days of the internet, Congress passed legislation that provided certainty and resisted the temptation to over-regulate the market. Our intent is to achieve a similar win for America's economy and for American leadership in this innovative space,\" Davidson said in a statement.A major concern for lawmakers and regulators has been consumer protection. Retail investors made speculative bets on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies last year, and many lost big as the crypto bubble burst. Bitcoin is down 71 percent this year while XRP, the second largest, is down 85 percent this year, according to data from CoinDesk.WATCH: When Bitcoin hit $100 for the first time in 2013\nVIDEO4:4104:41When Bitcoin hit $100: Watch CNBC's 2013 coverageMarkets\nSquare peg, round hole\nA recurring complaint from cryptocurrency participants is the idea of applying a 72-year-old securities law to digital currencies. The Securities and Exchange Commission uses what's known as the  \"Howey Test,\" which comes from a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court decision involving a Floridian citrus farmer to determine whether or not a cryptocurrency is a security.The Supreme Court determined that any transactions that qualify as  \"investment contracts\" are considered securities. According to the SEC, an investment contract exists if \"a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.\"But experts say those standards should be more nuanced for digital assets.Many of these cryptocurrencies are also blockchain software platforms, meaning you can build on top of them. They are also capable of being traded without an intermediary, making them far different from your average stock on the Nasdaq. \"These decentralized networks don't fit neatly within the existing regulatory structure,\" said Kristin Smith, head of the Blockchain Association, the first group in Washington to lobby for the technology behind bitcoin. \"This is a step forward in finding the right way to regulate them.\"SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has made it clear he does not intend to update those standards to cater to crypto. The chairman said at a Senate hearing earlier this year that every initial coin offering he has  \"seen is a security.\" The only two they agency has explicitly said are not securities are bitcoin and ether, which are regulated as commodities by the Commodities Futures Trade Commission.William Hinman, head of the Division of Corporation Finance at the SEC, said in June that bitcoin and ether are not securities because they are decentralized \u2014 meaning there is no central party whose efforts are a key determining factor in the enterprise. Initial coin offerings, or ICOs, he said are securities because of the expectation of a return by a third party.While the SEC has clarified existing laws and made exemptions, it would take moves by Congress to actually change any statutes the agency is required to follow.The bill looks to amend the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which established the current structure for what a security is, by adding a new definition for  \"digital tokens.\"Smith, who was an aide to former Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine, and lobbied blockchain issues for Overstock.com, said this bill does not mean that these digital tokens will go unregulated. If the bill passes, they will instead likely fall under the purview of the Federal Trade Commission or the CFTC.Thursday's bill also directs the IRS to adjust taxation of virtual currencies, create a tax exemption for exchanges of one virtual currency for another and to create a de minimis exemption from taxation for gains realized from the sale or exchange of virtual currency.\nHow did we get here?\nThe bill was months in the making, and was largely a result of a roundtable hosted by Davidson in September. More than 50 industry participants including experts from Fidelity, Nasdaq, State Street, Andreessen Horowitz and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce gathered on Capitol Hill to discuss regulatory shortcomings.At the Washington roundtable, advocates claimed that until regulation is crystal clear and updated for the modern digital asset class, the crypto industry can't flourish or mature. If regulators don't keep up, founders warned that innovation in these emerging markets will flee overseas.The group told stories of companies scrambling to interpret whether their ICOs are compliant. Because some have a  \"utility\" use case, founders argued they should be exempt from securities laws, and instead be considered a commodity regulated by the CFTC.The SEC has cracked down numerous cryptocurrency projects this year. Some ICOs have been proven to be outright frauds, others have been prosecuted for less egregious violations, like not registering with the agency.The issue has slowly gained some momentum in Congress. Earlier this month, Soto and other members of the House are introduced two bills that could bring more oversight and less opacity to the cryptocurrency industry.This week's bill is largely symbolic. Friday is likely the last day Congress is in session and the bill will need to be reintroduced next year, when Democrats are in control of the House. \"It shows that there's momentum on both sides,\" Smith said. \"There's interest among bipartisan members, and lays groundwork for the next Congress.\"\n", "birthday": "2018-12-20T18:31:17+0000", "date": "2018-12-20 18:31:17", "year": 2018, "month": 12, "day": 20}

Instead, they ask the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to come up with recommendations. \"Virtual currencies and the underlying blockchain technology has a profound potential to be a driver of economic growth,\" Reps. Darren Soto, D-Fla., and Ted Budd, R-N.C., said in a statement. \"That's why we must ensure that the United States is at the forefront of protecting consumers and the financial well-being of virtual currency investors, while also promoting an environment of innovation to maximize the potential of these technological advances.\"Any cryptocurrency legislation marks a certain maturity in these markets.While bitcoin itself has been around for a decade, the cryptocurrency fundraising method known as initial coin offerings began attracting billions of dollars from retail investors at the end of last year. Regulators and lawmakers were caught unprepared as many ICOs turned out to be frauds, backed merely by abstract ideas or in some cases nothing at all.Bitcoin's price soared to almost $20,000 amid the mad dash to own digital currency last year, but since then has lost more than 75 percent of its value. It dropped 37 percent in November alone.\nThe road to new crypto laws\nFor now, the regulatory environment in crypto is fragmented: The CFTC oversees the largest two, bitcoin and ether, and the Securities and Exchange Commission oversees all other cryptocurrencies.The SEC has cracked down with settlements on everything from fraud to failing to register initial coin offerings as securities. The agency's chairman, Jay Clayton, has repeatedly said that most cryptocurrencies are securities, and therefore need to register under those laws.More clarity and global competition were major themes in an October roundtable attended by more than than 50 industry participants and Budd and Soto. Attendees warned that if companies don't get a better idea of the industry's legal footing, the U.S. could fall behind on innovation and trail in the potentially profitable blockchain realm.The second bill, the U.S. Virtual Currency Market and Regulatory Competitiveness Act of 2018, centers on making sure the U.S. stays competitive in the industry. The bill directs the CFTC to do a comparative study of crypto regulation abroad, then make recommendations for U.S. regulatory changes. It also calls for alternatives to  \"current burdensome regulations that may inhibit innovation.\"Lawmakers are asking the CFTC to clarify which virtual currencies it sees as commodities. It also asks the agency to examine costs and benefits of a new regulatory structure that could replace the current money transmission system, which some in the industry have argued is inefficient.Many of the consumer protection concerns stemmed from a New York attorney general's report on virtual exchanges' risk of manipulation, the lawmakers said. The AG's months-long investigation published in September found that cryptocurrency exchanges are vulnerable to market manipulation and lack standard consumer protections that come with established financial markets.The first bill, also sponsored by Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., focuses on the AG's findings. The  \"Virtual Currency Consumer Protection Act\" would ask the CFTC to create a report examining potential for price manipulation in cryptocurrency and its effect on the economy.Others in Congress have also acknowledged a need for more rules regarding the digital asset class.Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, is drafting a crypto-related bill to be introduced before the end of this year that he said in October was not  \"fully cooked\" yet. In September, Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said he also planned to introduced three crypto and blockchain-friendly bills.\n", "birthday": "2018-12-06T16:30:41+0000", "date": "2018-12-06 16:30:41", "year": 2018, "month": 12, "day": 6}

The digital currency is now down more than 70 percent since the start of 2018 and 80 percent from its all-time high hit late last year.The market capitalization of all major cryptocurrencies took a $70 billion hit for the month, according to CoinMarketCap.com. XRP, the world's second largest cryptocurrency, dropped 18 percent in November while ether fell 43 percent in the same time period.For bitcoin, this month's price performance was a stark turnaround from its relatively stable October. The cryptocurrency traded near $6,400 without much volatility as global markets fell.Michael Moro, CEO of Genesis Global Trading, said  \"it didn't take much for the price to break down\" after bitcoin failed to stay above the key support level of $5,850. \"It's unclear if this is a 'bottom' or a brief period of consolidation before next move down, but buyers are still maintaining some cash on the sidelines in case it does go lower,\" Moro said.There was a spike in short interest in bitcoin as momentum traders piled on, he said.

Grogan | CNBC\nA cryptocurrency asset manager is mimicking the playbook of one of the industry's most notable critics: Warren Buffett.Morgan Creek Digital is recreating Buffett's famous $1 million wager pitting the performance of the S&P 500 against a group of hedge funds. But unlike the famous value-investor, Morgan Creek is betting against the S&P and placing its faith in the 10-year performance of cryptocurrencies.The crypto investing firm calls the challenge  \"Buffett Bet 2.0,\" and invites any investor who believes the S&P 500 will produce better returns than their basket of cryptocurrencies over a decade to take the other side of the bet.Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital, said whoever takes the other side will likely be someone with the same outlook as Buffett. It'll be either someone who is bullish on the S&P 500, or someone who thinks cryptocurrencies are worthless or overvalued. \"This is a combination of our outlook not only for the upside of cryptocurrencies but also the outlook on public equities,\" Pompliano told CNBC in a phone interview. \" A lot of people might look at this and just think we're bullish on crypto \u2014 but you need to look at what asset we're going up against. Public equities aren't exactly at their all time highs either.\"Pompliano pointed to recent losses is in FANG stocks and other investor favorites. These once high-flying tech stocks have taken a beating lately, with Facebook leading the group down, with a 24 percent loss year over year.Still, the losses look minor compared to cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, the world's largest and best-known cryptocurrency, was down 37 percent in November alone. The digital currency has dropped 73 percent this year after climbing to almost $20,000 last December.Morgan Creek was co-founded by Mark Yusko, former chief investment officer of the University of North Carolina's endowment. The index fund, the result of a partnership with Bitwise, offers accredited investors like professional investors and high net-worth individuals access to a basket of the top cryptocurrencies by market value. Pompliano said the index fund, which requires a minimum $50,000 investment, was structured to give similar exposure to the S&P 500, just with cryptocurrencies.Buffett, who recently called cryptocurrencies  \"rat poison squared,\" took a $1 million bet against asset manager Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Partners in 2007. The billionaire investor wagered his own money that a passive investment in the S&P 500 would outperform a sample of five actively managed hedge funds. Buffett won that bet in 2017, with the S&P returning about 7 percent compounded annually versus a 2.2 percent from the hedge funds, whose names were not publicly disclosed.Similarly, Morgan Creek partners are personally funding their side of the $1 million bet and said they would not be relying on money from the fund. They still need whoever takes the opposite side of their bet to agree, but Pompliano said the intention is for the winner to donate the proceeds to charity.WATCH: How Warren Buffett makes long-term investments\nVIDEO0:5800:58How Warren Buffett makes long-term investmentsMake It\n", "birthday": "2018-12-06T15:30:05+0000", "date": "2018-12-06 15:30:05", "year": 2018, "month": 12, "day": 6}

In addition to settling with crypto exchange EtherDelta, it also settled its first civil penalties solely for initial coin offering, or ICO, for a registration violation.San Francisco-based payment company Ripple, which owns roughly 60 percent of the XRP in existence and uses it for its cross-border payments products, has been in talks with Coinbase since at least April about adding the cryptocurrency.

Square board member and former Goldman Sachs finance chief David Viniar is overseeing the search.The company also said in a securities filing Jack Dorsey had sold roughly 130,000 shares, worth about $7.4 million at the time, in a pre-scheduled sale last week.Bitcoin was also lower Monday and fell below $5,000 for the first time since last October. Square offers bitcoin trading through its popular Square Cash app and said it generated $43 million in revenue from the cryptocurrency in the third quarter.Square is well-known in the payments sector for its credit card processor, payment hardware and popular Cash app but has also moved into small business lending through Square Capital.Apple, Amazon and Facebook also weighed on markets Monday with the S&P technology sector pulling back 3.9 percent.

Coinbase acts as what's known as an  \"agency\" and earns commission by executing client trades.\nVIDEO4:3804:38I come to bury bitcoin, says UBS' global chief economistFast Money\nCoinbase is best-known for the popular U.S. cryptocurrency exchange that was on-boarding as many as 50,000 retail accounts per day during the crypto boom last year. But although it took off with ordinary investors, many institutions weren't as eager to use it, according to Christine Sandler, the head of institutional sales.The OTC  \"soft launch\" began with a small network of clients like asset management firms. Sandler announced it in an interview with Cheddar this week. But she said it was important to debut it slowly with a ring of trusted institutions before they  \"blanketed the Earth\" with a new product.Sandler, who was head of electronic equity sales at Merrill Lynch and later Barclays during her 30-year career on Wall Street, described OTC as giving  \"an extra pair of hands\" to facilitate a trade.Clients can call Coinbase and say  \"I'd like to buy $1 million in bitcoin right now \u2014 what's the spread?\" Coinbase, in this case, finds willing buyers and sellers without tipping off the market that a big order is coming. Coinbase will then get a bid and an offer, and reflect that in multiple price quotes for the client.Wall Street professional investors are slowly warming to crypto. Goldman Sachs-backed Circle has a  \"principal\" OTC desk called Circle Trade with a minimum entry-point of $250,000. Principal trading desks use their own inventory complete customer orders and also provide liquidity for clients. Genesis Trading is another OTC option for crypto in addition to Gemini, a firm founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.The Coinbase executives anecdotally started to notice an increase in OTC volumes and decided it was time to jump in. \"This is a really opportunistic way for us to counterbalance and offer something that's different than our exchange trading but offers value to clients in a way that's really safe,\" Sandler said.\nCrypto risks\nOne of cryptocurrency's major benefits or risks \u2014 depending on who you ask \u2014 is its anonymity.Digital currencies' secretive nature has led to criticism from economist Nouriel Roubini and others, who peg it as the currency of choice for money-launderers or criminals. Bitcoin itself has fallen more than 70 percent from its high, marked by volatility on its way down.In addition to price and headline risk, counterparty risk that a party might not live up to its contract obligations is already top of mind for asset managers. \"All of the participants in this program and on our exchange have gone through full [know your customer] and [anti-money laundering],\" Sandler said. \"They're known entities to us.\"\nVIDEO1:5601:56SEC Chairman Jay Clayton on regulating cryptocurrenciesSquawk Box\nEventually, Coinbase said, it will also link the OTC offering to its custody business. Custody in cryptocurrency means storing these assets offline, in what's known as  \"cold storage.\" That makes it hard to make a trade quickly, since it takes multiple days in most cases to move the cryptocurrency back online. But at some point, Coinbase expects clients to be able to make those trades immediately in the OTC product before the funds are physically available, then settle the trade when the funds come out of cold storage days later.For now, Coinbase's OTC desk is only available to accredited investors on Coinbase Prime. Eventually though, executives said it will available for Coinbase Pro, which is designed for more sophisticated individual traders.Still, Sandler said the new product could have implications for the average bitcoin trader, in the sense that it brings more activity to the sector. \"It's bringing diverse flows to the marketplace, and that of diversity creates healthy markets,\" Sandler said. \"The worst thing a marketplace could be is homogeneous. Bringing more diversity to the marketplace is absolutely paramount.\"\n", "birthday": "2018-11-30T21:30:08+0000", "date": "2018-11-30 21:30:08", "year": 2018, "month": 11, "day": 30}

The SEC announced its first civil penalties against cryptocurrency founders on Friday as part of a wide regulatory and legal crackdown on abuses and outright fraud in the industry.Reports of possible cryptocurrency market manipulation also piled onto the negative sentiment.

But it's likely to be a sore subject for people who bragged during last year's holiday feast about their new investment idea.Your relatives who took the smug brother-in-law's advice and bought $1,000 worth of bitcoin during the week of Thanksgiving 2017, have lost about $450 of that investment. Those who waited to buy until the week after Thanksgiving 2017 have lost $550. And those who resisted temptation to buy until the week before Christmas last year have lost around $763 of that $1,000 investment.Bitcoin first topped $10,000 in the last days of November 2017, and by mid-December was worth almost $20,000, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. Contrast that to this Thanksgiving: Bitcoin's price has sunk back below $4,300 for the first time in 13 months.Kyle Asman, partner and co-founder of crypto advisory firm BX3 Capital, began using cryptocurrency in 2013 for online gambling. He was shocked when bitcoin came up at his own dinner table. \"Before that it was more of a closet thing,\" Asman said, though he did notice the price started spiking last year around the holiday. \"I remember that was the only time I had talked about it at my Thanksgiving table \u2014 some described it as digital gold, others as a new form of money.\"In the weeks after Thanksgiving, the price moves became even more exaggerated. Asman recalled being at a holiday party, going into the restroom when bitcoin was $9,000 and returning minutes later to have a friend tell him it was trading at $11,000.ALSO WATCH: Here's what Gary Shilling really thinks of bitcoin\nVIDEO1:3301:33Gary Shilling on bitcoin: It's a 'Ponzi scheme'Politics\nFear of missing out\nThe cryptocurrency's run-up last year granted it sudden pop-culture status and ushered in retail investors thanks to what many call  \"FOMO,\" or \"fear of missing out.\" \"It's easy to dismiss crypto as some sort of fake money that's only useful for criminal enterprises, but at some point when the price went up by so much, so quickly, people had no choice but to peek under the hood and see what was going on,\" said Steve Ehrlich, chief operating officer at Wall Street Blockchain Alliance.Another phenomenon that took off alongside bitcoin was a new fundraising method called initial coin offerings. ICOs have attracted billions of dollars from investors, often without a live product. Many have been outed as outright frauds, and others have settled with U.S. regulators for not registering as securities. \"These companies raised insane amounts of money and had no pressure to ever deliver,\" said Ehrlich, a former Citi fintech analyst. \"Since then, a lot of people have realized most of the money from ICOs was irresponsible and a lot of those companies are never going to deliver any of those products.\"\nBefore popular U.S. exchanges like Coinbase, Ehrlich pointed out that bitcoin was complicated and nearly impossible to buy unless you had a computer science or coding background. Coinbase, valued at $8 billion, at one point was signing up 50,000 new customers a day at the height of the crypto boom last year, CEO Brian Armstrong said at the Bloomberg Players Technology Summit in San Francisco this summer.But it wasn't all dinner-table hype that led to the epic price rise.The rapid spike also coincided with the introduction of a bitcoin futures market. Peak prices lined up with the day the Chicago Mercantile Exchange introduced bitcoin futures trading on Dec. 17. The Chicago Board Options Exchange opened a futures market a week earlier.Until futures existed, it was extremely difficult, if not impossible, to bet on the decline of bitcoin prices.This week, bitcoin futures products hit their lowest level since they were introduced. Research from the San Francisco Federal Reserve suggests bitcoin futures were partly to blame, as investors finally got the option to bet against the cryptocurrency.U.S. regulators have flagged other potentially nefarious reasons for bitcoin's stratospheric rise last year.The Justice Department is reportedly looking into whether traders used tether, a controversial cryptocurrency that founders say is backed one-to-one by a U.S. dollar, to prop up bitcoin during its record-breaking rally, according to Bloomberg News, which cited three people familiar with the matter.Some academics are also skeptical. University of Texas finance professor John Griffin, who has a 10-year track record of spotting financial fraud, and graduate student Amin Shams published a study in June that said at least least half of the jump in bitcoin was due to coordinated price manipulation.At key moments when bitcoin was declining, they said tether was used to buy bitcoin to help  \"stabilize and manipulate\" the cryptocurrency's price.Despite the massive losses this year, Asman think his own family members remain curious and open to the conversation. But this year, the theme might be less about the  \"crazy euphoria\" of last year and more about looking ahead to 2019. \"A lot of people are going to wonder what happened, and what comes next,\" Asman said.WATCH: When bitcoin hit $100 in 2013\nVIDEO4:4104:41When Bitcoin hit $100: Watch CNBC's 2013 coverageMarkets\n\n", "birthday": "2018-11-21T12:31:32+0000", "date": "2018-11-21 12:31:32", "year": 2018, "month": 11, "day": 21}

The stock soared, splitting in June 1998, and continued to climb to more than $300 per share by December 1998. Amazon executed its only two other splits in January and September of 1999 right before the dot-com bubble burst in March 2000. In September 2001, Amazon traded for under $6 per share.Fast forward, Amazon in September 2018 became the second U.S. company to eclipse a stock market value of more than $1 trillion. (Apple was the first, a month before.) But since its all-time high of $2,050 per share on Sept. 4, Amazon lost 27 percent in the October and November rout as of Tuesday's close.However, Kerner said that kind of volatility, while troubling, is nothing compared to what longtime bitcoin investors must endure.  \"There was a day in 2013 when we were down 70 percent overnight. Nobody likes being down like this. But this is what investing in crypto is all about.\"Bitcoin became a phenomenon in 2017, skyrocketing from about $3,600 per coin to more than $19,000 in December of that year. But by February 2018, it fell under $7,000. After bouncing around for most of this year, bitcoin plunged about 30 percent over seven sessions to about $4,100 as of Tuesday. Other cryptocurrencies fared much worse. But bitcoin was actually up nearly 3 percent in early Wednesday trading. \"Crypto has been so weak because most of it there's no underlying value outside of confidence,\" Kerner said. \"[But] bitcoin, itself, we think is going to replace gold eventually. Gold is an $8 trillion thing.\" \"I think it's a store of value. I think it's the greatest store of value ever created,\" he added. \"It should surpass gold over time. It won't happen overnight.\"Kerner isn't the only crypto investor who believes bitcoin will become the new gold. But there's plenty of skepticism among many Wall Street veterans, including J.P. Morgan chief Jamie Dimon who in September 2017 called bitcoin a fraud only to walk back those comments a bit about three months later.In putting his faith in bitcoin, Kerner said he subscribes to Amara's law, which was coined by Stanford professor Roy Amara in the 1970s. It holds that the impact of all great technological change is overestimated in the short run, and subsequently underestimated in the long run. But in the meantime, he said he's  \"holding on for dear life.\"\n", "birthday": "2018-11-21T15:41:13+0000", "date": "2018-11-21 15:41:13", "year": 2018, "month": 11, "day": 21}

He's now betting the future of that brand on multiple blockchain start-ups through its fully owned subsidiary called Medici Ventures.The Salt Lake City-based company has invested $175 million in Medici, which has been burning money since its 2014 inception: It lost lost $39 million in the first three quarters of the year, and roughly $22 million last year, according to the company's public filings. Overstock itself is in the red, with a net loss of $163 million in the first three quarters of this year.One of its best-known start-ups, tZero, a trading system that hasn't launched commercially, is also burning money. \"I don't care whether tZero is losing $2 million a month,\" Byrne told the Journal. \"We think we've got cold fusion on the blockchain side.\"Medici houses start-ups that go well beyond the scope of just cryptocurrencies. One company Voatz, runs blockchain-based voting through a smartphone app while another is working on digital property rights in Rwanda.While Byrne told investors in a September shareholder letter that Overstock does not  \"have significant holdings of bitcoin, \" the share price moves have been tightly correlated. During the cryptocurrency's rise to nearly $20,000 last year, Overstock shares surged more than 400 percent from July through the end of 2018. After trading above $80 in January, the stock is down to just above $21 as of Friday afternoon.Bitcoin itself was trading above $4,200 on Friday, down 78 percent since its high reached in December 2017.Multiple Wall Street CEOs have denounced bitcoin as a scam or bubble, while Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett famously likened it to rat poison. But its underlying technology is more widely accepted among public companies. IBM, J.P. Morgan, Deloitte, Amazon and Facebook are among those implementing the technology in some way.Still, skeptics abound on the blockchain side. Global economist Nouriel Roubini, one of the few who predicted the 2008 financial crisis, recently called the technology the most  \"over-hyped \u2014 and least useful \u2014 technology in human history.\"\n", "birthday": "2018-11-23T14:41:49+0000", "date": "2018-11-23 14:41:49", "year": 2018, "month": 11, "day": 23}

But in some cases, it also might mean you're getting hacked.San Francisco resident Robert Ross, a father of two, noticed his phone suddenly lose its signal on Oct. 26. Confused, he went to a nearby Apple store and later contacted his service provider, AT&T. But he wasn't quick enough to stop a hacker from draining $500,000 from two separate accounts he had at Coinbase and Gemini, according to Santa Clara officials.Nicholas Truglia, 21, lifted the $1 million from Ross' two cryptocurrency accounts, according to a felony complaint filed this month in California state court. Prosecutors say Truglia also hacked the phones of multiple Silicon Valley executives but was not able to rob their accounts. \"It's a whole new wave of crime,\" said Erin West, the deputy district attorney of Santa Clara County. \"It's a new way of stealing of money: They target people that they believe to have cryptocurrency,\" she told CNBC.Truglia has been charged with 21 counts, which include identity theft, fraud, embezzlement, crimes that  \"involve a pattern of related felony conduct,\" and attempted grand theft in Ross' case, according to court documents.West said Ross had been saving that money for his daughters' college funds, and stored it in U.S. dollars on the crypto exchanges. Truglia later converted that money to cryptocurrency and moved it to his own accounts before Ross was able to regain control of his phone number.Officials obtained a warrant and searched Truglia's 42nd Street high-rise in Manhattan last week, they told CNBC. They were able to recover $300,000 from a computer hard drive. But the rest of the missing money may be tough to track down.Cryptocurrency fans have said it is more trustworthy because transactions are recorded on a public ledger, known as blockchain. Transactions can be seen by anyone, but the identity of the sender and receiver are anonymous. \"In some ways, it's helpful because we can see where the money is going \u2014 that's the beauty of the blockchain,\" West told CNBC. \"It's public, but what we still can't see is who holds those accounts.\"Cryptocurrency trading became especially popular last year, attracting floods of retail investors as bitcoin rose to nearly $20,000. But with that popularity came hacks. The total in cryptocurrency lost by individuals hit $1.6 billion at the end of June, according to CoinDesk's 2018 State of Blockchain Report. Bitcoin itself is now down more than 75 percent since those December highs, and was trading near $4,400 Wednesday.Other victims that were hacked and named in the court papers include Saswata Basu, the CEO of blockchain storage service 0Chain; Myles Danielson, a hedge-fund executive, and Gabrielle Katsnelson, co-founder of start-up SMBX.Truglia has agreed to extradition, and Santa Clara officials expect to pick him up in December. After that, a court date will be set, officials said.\n \"SIM-swapping\" schemes\nIt would hardly be the first instance of phone hacking. Criminals are exploiting a tactic known as  \"SIM swapping\" to take over phone number accounts by duping wireless carriers.Wireless store employees can assign your phone number to any device with the right authorization. To confirm a phone swap, they ask for pieces of private information like a birthday or a Social Security number. This data can be bought on the dark web and later used to answer security questions from a wireless store employee.Once the criminal hacks into a person's email or cryptocurrency account from their own devices, what's known as  \"two-factor identification\" will send a text code to the phone number to prevent any sort of unauthorized login. But because the hacker now controls that phone number, there's no way for the rightful owner to quickly regain control or stop the hack.This summer, a California man sued AT&T for $224 million after hackers used his number to steal $24 million worth of cryptocurrency stored on an online exchange. Michael Terpin accused AT&T of negligence in that case, likening it to  \"a hotel giving a thief with a fake ID a room key and a key to the room safe to steal jewelry in the safe from the rightful owner.\"In order to stop that trend, cybersecurity and industry experts say investors should guard their cellphone numbers with the same paranoia with which they guard their Social Security numbers. Experts also recommend that investors keep their funds in what's known as  \"cold storage.\" The method allows you to store digital currency offline, away from any internet access. That makes it harder to hack.WATCH: How the dark web became the platform for all things illegal\nVIDEO3:3903:39Dark web: how the unseen internet is accessedDigital Original\n\n", "birthday": "2018-11-21T19:59:21+0000", "date": "2018-11-21 19:59:21", "year": 2018, "month": 11, "day": 21}

Meantime, XRP, a digital token associated with blockchain firm Ripple, dipped 6.7 percent to below 41 cents, while ether, the digital token of the Ethereum blockchain, fell more than 7 percent to just under $122.\nVIDEO7:1807:18Tom Lee cuts bitcoin year-end target to $15,000Squawk Box\nThe extension of losses for the market comes on the heels of a Tuesday report by Bloomberg News that the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether cryptocurrency traders used tether, a token founders claim is pegged to the U.S. dollar, and an associated trading venue called Bitfinex, to buoy the price of bitcoin.Tether has proven to be a point of contention for the entire industry, given doubts around whether it holds enough dollar reserves to match the number of tether tokens in circulation. Tether claims it does.The controversial token sank well below its dollar peg last month, dropping as low as 93 cents, as questions built up over its alleged role in driving bitcoin's rally \u2014 which saw the digital coin soar close to $20,000 \u2014 last year.But Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, insisted the market was still driven by  \"technicals.\" \"The price (of bitcoin) is up more than 1,000 percent over the last three years, and after the great bull run in Q4 2017, what we're seeing now is simply a pullback,\" he said. \"In percentage terms, this type of pullback is quite normal for bitcoin and has happened many times since its inception.\"There have been a number of instances in which the price of bitcoin has been shown to have fallen steeply. \"There are many side stories in the crypto space right now some of them fairly complex, including the bitcoin cash hard fork, but none of them have any fundamental reasons to send prices down,\" Greenspan said. \"In fact, (it's) the opposite. The crypto industry is progressing at a rapid rate, blockchain projects are hiring and institutional players are getting ready to enter the space.\"\n\n\n", "birthday": "2018-11-23T15:02:06+0000", "date": "2018-11-23 15:02:06", "year": 2018, "month": 11, "day": 23}

The plunge followed what had been a surprisingly calm few months for bitcoin and a break from the rest of its volatile trading year. Since then, prices have hit new 13-month lows and struggled to move out of the $4,300 range.The price dips are a stark contrast from last Thanksgiving when the cryptocurrency was entering a hot streak thanks to a wave of new retail investors. Since that holiday week last year, prices are down by more than 55 percent.\nBreaking down the dip\nSome analysts blamed a  \"fork\" in the cryptocurrency bitcoin cash for that initial drop below $6,000. That digital currency split into two versions in mid-November and diverted what's known as \"hash power,\" which some say dragged down the broader crypto markets. Both sides appeared to be selling bitcoin to \"fund mining operations to win the battle,\" Brian Kelly, CEO of BKAM, told CNBC.The $6,000 level could have been a key exit point for some traders. Bitcoin going below it likely triggered  \"stop losses\" which could have exacerbated the selling. Those bitcoin support levels were broken as the cryptocurrency continued to hit lower lows.Regulatory crackdowns have also weighed on prices.The Securities and Exchange Commission announced its first civil penalties against cryptocurrency founders last week as part of a wide regulatory and legal crackdown on fraud and abuses in the industry.\nEarlier this week, Bloomberg News reported that U.S. regulators are looking into whether bitcoin's record-breaking rally last year was the result of market manipulation. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether traders used tether, a controversial cryptocurrency that founders say is backed 1:1 by a U.S. dollar, to prop up bitcoin, according to the report, which cited three people familiar with the matter.Bitcoin could also be feeling the effect of other global markets sliding this week. \"Markets around the world are fragile, and panic and sentiment are playing a disproportionate role right now,\" Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CNBC this week. \"Does this mean bitcoin is broken? No. The use case is still there, but in the short term, panics are panics.\"\u2014 CNBC's Ryan Browne contributed to this report.WATCH: This company wants to be the Amazon Prime for gasoline\n\n", "birthday": "2018-11-23T16:50:56+0000", "date": "2018-11-23 16:50:56", "year": 2018, "month": 11, "day": 23}

Donors seeking a break on their 2018 taxes must make their charitable contributions before Dec. 31.Keep in mind that it's also harder to take the deduction for charitable giving, as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has roughly doubled the standard deduction to $12,000 for singles and $24,000 for married couples who file jointly and limited certain itemized deductions, including a break for state and local taxes.As a result, fewer people are expected to itemize in 2018 and fewer individuals will qualify to claim their charitable donations on their taxes.For those who can itemize, cash donations and highly appreciated stocks often are the items generous filers want to give away. However, these aren't the only things charitable organizations are willing to take.For instance, Fidelity Charitable received close to $1 billion in so-called complex assets in 2017. \"Complex assets are basically what isn't traded publicly, including private shares, bitcoin, real estate and bags of corn,\" said Amy Pirozzolo, vice president at Fidelity Charitable.\nIf you have stuff in your house you can't wait to get rid of, you think it's the most valuable thing in the world.Tim SteffenCPA, director of advanced planning at Robert W.

There have also been reports of people dumping huge servers they used to mine cryptocurrency due to the falling prices of virtual currencies. One widely-shared social media post \u2014 which could not be independently verified by CNBC \u2014 appeared to show someone in China wheeling away cryptocurrency mining rigs from a mining facility.When a miner successfully validates a transaction, they are rewarded in cryptocurrency.

The cryptocurrency slid below $3,500 for the first time in 14 months, then later recovered toward the $3,900 level by Monday, according to data from CoinDesk. That brings its decline from last year's peak to more than 81 percent.That loss isn't the worst bitcoin has suffered, but the world's largest digital currency is getting close.\nWay, way back in 2010\nBitcoin's current level is still well above the fraction of a penny price where it first began trading in 2010\u2014 and its early investors are mostly wealthier because of it.By June 2011, it had risen to a new all-time high of roughly $30. But by that November, the cryptocurrency was back below $2.50, tumbling more than 92 percent from their high.That year, volume was still low and the dozens of now popular trading exchanges like Coinbase didn't exist yet. Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox was handling roughly 70 percent of all cryptocurrency transactions in the world.The site experienced its first of multiple hacks in 2011, and its eventual downfall coincided with what would be bitcoin's next bear market in 2013.\n2013 through 2015\nTwo years later, most bitcoin trading was still done on the soon-to-be defunct Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange. During the two years leading up to 2015, Mt. Gox was effectively frozen out of the U.S. banking system for regulatory issues. It stopped trading, closed its website and filed for bankruptcy protection.Bitcoin first shot above the $1,000 mark in December 2013, according to data from CoinDesk. Two years later, it was back below $200. The cryptocurrency saw an 84 percent rout between those two years.\n if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"Fgg4M\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"Fgg4M\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":444,\"200\":400,\"300\":400,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"Fgg4M\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-Fgg4M\"),window.datawrapper[\"Fgg4M\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"Fgg4M\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"Fgg4M\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"Fgg4M\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"Fgg4M\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"});\n2018\nMeasured in dollars, this year's damage has been much more significant. Roughly $700 billion has been wiped off cryptocurrencies' global market capitalization since the high, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. The price of one bitcoin has dropped more than $15,000 since December.Bitcoin skyrocketed to current its all-time high of almost $20,000 in December 2017. Coinbase's CEO said this summer that at the height of that boom, the exchange was opening up 50,000 new accounts a day, for mostly retail investors. The all-time high also came ahead of the availability of bitcoin futures. Those products have also fallen. On Monday, they dropped to their lowest levels since launching.Trading volumes are also down drastically. Bitcoin's 24-hour volume was near $49 billion at the peak, and as of Monday was down 61 percent, to $19 billion.Even some bitcoin bulls are anticipating more short-term carnage.Anthony Pompliano, founder and partner at crypto investment firm Morgan Creek Digital Assets, is predicting an 85 percent decline from the all-time high. That would make this year's downturn the second-worst bear market for bitcoin, implying a price of about $3,000. \"We've probably got a bit more to fall,\" Pompliano told CNBC's Squawk Box Monday.Still, Pompliano is bullish on its long-term value. Despite the volatility, it's still the up more than 400 percent in the past two years, far outperforming the S&P 500's 20 gains in the same time frame. \"Through 2017 all of the buyers were retail \u2014 as the price is drawing down you're starting to see institutional investors come in,\" Pompliano said.\n\nWATCH: Bitcoin could be the biggest bubble in history - here's how\nVIDEO2:0002:00Bitcoin could be the biggest bubble in history \u2013 here's howDigital Original\n\n", "birthday": "2018-11-26T18:54:02+0000", "date": "2018-11-26 18:54:02", "year": 2018, "month": 11, "day": 26}

Istanbul is a common jumping-ff point for people traveling from Western countries to join ISIS by crossing into nearby Syria.Law enforcement agents, who were aware of her wire transfers abroard, intercepted Shahaz at an airline gate at JFK, prosecutors said. She told them that she planned to visit various mosques and tourist sites in Istanbul.But when she was asked about some of the wire transfers,  \"she provided false and conflicting explanations\" about the reason for them, prosecutors said. Shahnaz also was carrying $9,500 in cash, $500 less than the amount that triggers a requirement for travelers to disclose the amount of currency in their possession when flying outside of the United States.A federal grand jury indicted Shahnaz months later, in December 2017, and she was detained without bail after her arrest.WATCH: Bitcoin mining can land you in jail in this country\nVIDEO0:0000:00Bitcoin mining can land you in jail in this countryDigital Original\n\n", "birthday": "2018-11-26T20:56:08+0000", "date": "2018-11-26 20:56:08", "year": 2018, "month": 11, "day": 26}

Many critics have poured scorn on the volatility of the currencies and their lack of government regulation.But many have spoken favorably of the blockchain, which is the public ledger behind some of these currencies, including bitcoin. The blockchain has won plaudits because it cannot be tampered with or changed retrospectively. Advocates of the technology say this makes bitcoin transactions secure and safer than current system.Speaking to CNBC's Eunice Yoon at East Tech West in the Nansha district of Guangzhou, China, Yeung said the Chinese government is investing in the blockchain but said  \"what they are not endorsing is the crypto part of things, which is challenging the fundamental of financial systems.\"She made the comments when asked what the strategy was for cryptocurrency in China, after the government banned cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs) there in September 2017, marking the start of a crackdown on digital currency in the country.\n\nThe China Internet Report, created by Yeung, further details how China wants to be a frontrunner in blockchain technology despite the crypto ban. It says that Shanghai, Shanxi, Henan, Guangzhou, Guiyang and Hangzhou have all issued policies to encourage blockchain development.New funding has come from Shenzhen, after it established a 500 million ($71.9 million) yuan fund for blockchain investments. Hangzhou also announced plans to invest 10 billion yuan in a blockchain fund. The sector also has central government support from President Xi Jinping who ordered the use of blockchain technologies to create a smart city for the Xiongan New Area economic zone.Blockchain start-ups are also seeing investment growth. The report highlights that the 41 percent of new Chinese companies that received funding in the first quarter of 2017 were blockchain-related.\nBlockchain potential\nSpeaking at East Tech West, Yeung said the kind of blockchain companies that have potential in China are those more on the enterprise side of things. \"I was looking at a user case where they were trying to certify diamonds. Diamonds come from one place and you pass it (on) ... you wanna make sure that it's real jewelry for us,\" she explained. \"I think there is a lot of really practical use cases the whole world can use blockchain for,\" she said.\nEdith Yeung, Head of Greater China & Partner of 500 Startups China, speaks during Fireside Chat on Day 1 of CNBC East Tech West at LN Garden Hotel Nansha Guangzhou on November 27, 2018 in Nansha, Guangzhou, China.Dave Zhong/Getty Images for CNBC International\nYeung's report also highlights more examples where blockchain can be applied across industries, including health care, logistics, identity management, and digital asset tracking.China's big internet giants \u2014 Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent \u2014 collectively known as BAT in the industry, are also all building or investing in the blockchain, the report shows. It sets out some recent examples, including Alibaba's partnership with the city of Changzhou in August 2017 to launch China's first application of blockchain technology in the medical sector.While Tencent partnered with the China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing in March 2018 to develop an industry application based on the Tencent blockchain \u2014 TrustSQL.\n", "birthday": "2018-11-27T14:45:53+0000", "date": "2018-11-27 14:45:53", "year": 2018, "month": 11, "day": 27}

Blockchain platforms are secured through cryptography, assigning a unique alphanumeric code to each user, which is effectively treated as a digital signature for every transaction that make.\nCrypto meltdown\nThe cryptocurrency market had a challenging week last week as investors sold their holdings in digital assets. Bitcoin, normally known for its volatile price swings, was relatively stable earlier this month before suddenly plunging below $6,000.Markets have had a slight lift recently, with most cryptocurrencies trading in positive territory on Tuesday. However, bitcoin, XRP and ether \u2014 collectively the largest three \u2014 are still down 80 percent, 90 percent and 91 percent respectively since their all-time highs.The total value of the crypto market as a whole has lost more than $700 billion since its January peak, according to CoinMarketCap data. But Xin was mostly unfazed by the rout in prices.\nVIDEO3:3203:32Is Google a monopoly?CNBC Explains\n \"I think with more and more people adopting bitcoin and other crypto tokens, then more and more usage will be adopted by people,\" he said.Some governments \u2014 China's included \u2014 have taken a markedly harsher stance on cryptocurrencies. Beijing last year banned a controversial practice known as an initial coin offering, or ICO, where start-ups raise money by selling new digital tokens. The government also shuttered local bitcoin exchanges.Speaking about his own company's business model, where firms are rewarded in cryptocurrency in exchange for data, Xin suggested Bottos could only grow more from here. \"I think more and more people would accept this way to be rewarded,\" he said.\n\n\n", "birthday": "2018-11-28T12:06:36+0000", "date": "2018-11-28 12:06:36", "year": 2018, "month": 11, "day": 28}

In April, Nasdaq announced a collaboration with digital currency exchange Gemini, founded by early bitcoin investors Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss. The deal gives Gemini access to Nasdaq's surveillance technology to help make sure the platform provides a fair and  \"rules-based marketplace\" for their own participants, Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss said in a statement.Exchange-traded funds track an index or group of assets but trade like stocks. Analysts say the approval of one could bring in a wave of institutional buyers and because bitcoin has a fixed supply theoretically push up prices.The agency has rejected multiple applications for a cryptocurrency ETF. In its decision not to approve the Winklevoss brothers' ETF, the SEC pointed to the risks of fraud and market manipulation and the challenge of investor protection.\nCustody needs to be 'improved'\nHow to safely store these assets is a major roadblock. While bitcoin's price itself is certainly volatile, investors could also be exposed to a risk of theft in the underlying asset. \"We've seen some thefts around digital assets that make you scratch your head,\" Clayton told Silver Lake Partners Co-founder and North Island Chairman Glenn Hutchins, who moderated the panel. \"We care that the assets underlying that ETF have good custody, and that they're not going to disappear.\"There are dozens of cryptocurrency custody solutions that have either been announced or are already on the market. Fidelity said in October that it was launching a separate company to handle cryptocurrency custody and trade execution for institutional investors.Crypto companies Coinbase, Gemini, BitGo, Ledger and ItBit are among those already working on similar solutions. Japanese bank Nomura also announced plans in May to offer crypto custody, and Goldman Sachs and Northern Trust are reportedly exploring custodial services. But until Fidelity, there had been a noticeable lack of big U.S.-based incumbents officially entering the space.Despite the options, Clayton said custody offerings still  \"need to be improved and hardened.\"Watch: When bitcoin first hit $100\nVIDEO4:4104:41When Bitcoin hit $100: Watch CNBC's 2013 coverageMarkets\n'Assume' your ICO is a security\nClayton also had a message for those issuing initial coin offerings: Chances are, it's subject to SEC laws. \"You should start with the assumption that you're starting with a securities offering,\" Clayton said.In June, Clayton made it clear that the agency won't bend the rules for cryptocurrency when it comes to defining what is or what isn't a security. He told CNBC at the time that the U.S. has built a $19 trillion securities market that's  \"the envy of the world\" following the current rules.Whether an asset is a security right now follows the  \"Howey Test.\" The ruling comes from a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court case that classifies a security as an investment of money in a common enterprise, in which the investor expects profits primarily from others' efforts.The SEC has said explicitly that bitcoin and ether are treated as commodities and therefore aren't subject to that test. But all other cryptocurrencies are still seen by the SEC as securities and need to register with the agency.The SEC has penalized multiple cryptocurrency projects that failed to do so. Earlier in November, the agency announced its first civil penalties against founders who did not register new coin offerings, adding to its crackdown aimed at abuses and outright fraud in the growing digital industry.Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, was trading near $3,760 Tuesday, down more than 80 percent from its all-time high in December, according to data from CoinDesk.\n", "birthday": "2018-11-27T23:25:29+0000", "date": "2018-11-27 23:25:29", "year": 2018, "month": 11, "day": 27}

The SEC has turned down multiple other applications, including one by brothers Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss, citing risks of market manipulation and investor protection.The U.S. financial watchdog has yet to approve one.

The cryptocurrency has dropped by more than 68 percent in 2018, and is now off more than 77 percent from its all-time high.Andy Bromberg, co-founder and president of CoinList, a platform for listing digital tokens, said Wednesday's recovery may have been the result of investors  \"digging back in after the craziness of last week.\" \"Today's rise is mostly a reaction to the precipitous drops last week and people thinking that may have been an overreaction,\" Bromberg told CNBC.Because crypto markets are still relatively small, one buyer placing an especially large  \"buy\" order can \"kick off an avalanche,\" Bromberg said.Brian Kelly, CEO of BKCM, said bitcoin may have also been boosted by  \"hash wars\" over bitcoin cash finally coming to an end.

The initial launch was set for November 2018, but the company announced last week it would push that debut back to January.Kelly Loeffler, chief executive officer of Bakkt, gave some details on the decision. She explained that the original timeline was ambitious and the customer pipeline filled up quickly.\n\n \"To give it the best chance for success we pushed it back to the holidays to give people more time to get on board,\" Loeffler said. \"It's a positive indication of the interest and it gives people time to learn. We have a responsibility to do that so we're taking that extra time.\"Bakkt is starting with bitcoin, which is regulated by the Commody Futures Trading Commission. The company's role, as Loeffler explained it, is to provide custody and price discovery for bitcoin that's free from fraud and manipulation. Prices now tend to fluctuate depending on the exchange, which in many cases are unregulated. \"We're creating that infrastructure that doesn't exist today, which we think is a big opportunity for institutional investors to come in,\" Loeffler said.Another key difference is how the futures contracts will settle.Bakkt's bitcoin futures will settle in bitcoin. Existing bitcoin futures on the CME and CBOE, which began trading in December, settle in cash. Those futures contracts this week hit their lowest prices since they began trading last year.

The world's largest cryptocurrency was trading around $4,300 as of 3:55 p.m. ET.\nBitcoin as a benchmark\nWhile it might not have the best technology of all cryptocurrencies, bitcoin will still likely emerge as the yardstick by which all others are measured, Sprecher said. \"Somehow bitcoin has lived in a swamp and survived,\" Sprecher said.  \"There are thousands of other tokens that you could argue are better but yet bitcoin continues to survive, thrive and attract attention.\"Sprecher, who is married to Loeffler, likened it to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The  \"Dow\" as it's known, is an index of 30 stocks that is price-weighted, meaning it gives higher-priced stocks more influence but doesn't take into account the industry size or market cap. \"The Dow has been around for decades. It's a terrible index. We could come up with an index that's more representative of our economy but somehow that index will not go away,\" Sprecher said.Dow critics say it's not an accurate representation of market performance. Yet, it's the most widely used barometer. Similarly bitcoin has flaws, but Sprecher said it's still likely to be the go-to cryptocurrency. \"Often times in finance, it's not about being the best \u2014 it turns out to be about being the broadest and the most commonly accepted and for whatever reason bitcoin has become that.\"WATCH:\u00a0Bitcoin is disrupting the $45 billion art industry\nVIDEO1:3601:36Bitcoin is disrupting the $45 billion art industryDigital Original\n\n", "birthday": "2018-11-28T21:31:51+0000", "date": "2018-11-28 21:31:51", "year": 2018, "month": 11, "day": 28}

Mandel, 41, said the decision was twofold: It increases  \"options and ease\" for taxpayers, and it opens the door to software engineers and tech start-ups. \"We're doing this to plant the flag in Ohio as a national and international leader in blockchain technology,\" Mandel told CNBC at the Consensus Invest conference in New York this week. \"We really want to roll out the red carpet and welcome all sorts of blockchain companies to Ohio \u2014 not just in the cryptocurrency space but in a variety of different use cases.\"States tend to compete for software engineers and new businesses, Mandel said. By being open to bitcoin, the idea is that blockchain companies may follow.Forty-one-year-old Mandel, a former U.S. marine who served multiple tours in Iraq, led the cryptocurrency charge after learning about bitcoin a few years earlier. The bitcoin-tax process started in the middle of this year, he said.For now, the payment option is only available to businesses. Companies can go to OhioCrypto.com, enter their tax information, then third-party payment processor BitPay verifies the transaction on blockchain. It converts the cryptocurrency to U.S. dollars, then transfer those dollars to the state of Ohio.For now, Ohio is the only bitcoin-friendly state for taxes. But Mandel hopes the move will inspire others, including the IRS. \"By leading the charge at the state level, we hope that will inspire other states and ultimately the federal government to allow people to pay their federal taxes.\"Bitcoin seemed like  \"a good place to start,\" Mandel said, but the state will eventually would look to accept individual taxes and a range of other cryptocurrencies.One benefit is price. While there is no fee to pay taxes with a check, or ACH deposit, paying by credit card incurs a 2.5 percent fee. Paying in bitcoin is a 1 percent fee, collected by BitPay. \"Not only is this a new option, it's actually a less expensive option,\" Mandel said.Bitcoin can be a divisive topic with its fair share of critics. CEOs like Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett have repeatedly warned investors of the hype and risks. News of hacks and fraud in initial coin offerings have also muddied the reputation of cryptocurrencies. Still, Mandel said he hasn't seen resistance from state policy-makers. \"We haven't seen pushback,\" Mandel said. \"Thankfully, not yet.\"\nBitcoin's price pain\nBitcoin started a decade ago but gained status as a household name during its 1,300 percent price rise and march to nearly $20,000 last year. Because the cryptocurrency's value can vary drastically in a single day, it hasn't widely caught on as a means of payment.Those prices have dropped precipitously this year. Since January, the cryptocurrency has fallen roughly 70 percent. Sunday it fell below $3,500 for the first time in 14 months, and lost 30 percent in over seven days. It recovered slightly this week and was trading near $4,300 Thursday, according to CoinDesk.\n if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"dQjoY\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"dQjoY\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":470,\"200\":427,\"300\":427,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"dQjoY\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-dQjoY\"),window.datawrapper[\"dQjoY\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"dQjoY\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"dQjoY\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"dQjoY\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"dQjoY\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"});\nDespite the price pain, BitPay CEO Stephen Pair said the amount of bitcoin payment transactions are growing steadily.

The firm uses blockchain technology to share credit data between banks.The former Goldman Sachs president told the Financial Times, which first reported the news, that this was a  \"unique opportunity,\" and \"an obvious place to take a very, very analogue industry and digitize.\" Cohn has made very few public appearances since leaving the administration, and this is one of the first reports of his next job. \"I have been very interested in blockchain technology for a number of years, and Spring Labs is developing a network that could have profound implications for the financial services sector, among others,\" Cohn said in a press release Friday. \"I am excited to actively support the Spring Labs team in the development of this important business and network.\"The 20-person start-up uses blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as\u00a0bitcoin, to swap credit and identity information between banks and corporations. The task of safely transferring consumer credit information has plagued companies such as Equifax, which was hacked earlier this year, subsequently unveiling the private information of 143 million Americans.Spring Labs has raised about $15 million to date in seed funding, according to Pitchbook. Other advisory board members include Bobby Mehta, former CEO of Transunion, and Brian Brooks, chief legal officer at cryptocurrency company Coinbase. The company was founded by members of the team and board of lending platform Avant.Cohn was a key player in drafting the GOP tax reform package, which was voted through Congress and signed by President Donald Trump late last year. He left the White House following disagreements over plans to implement aluminum and steel tariffs.Cohn isn't the first executive to go from Wall Street to the new frontier of blockchain. Former head of J.P. Morgan global commodities Blythe Masters is now CEO of a blockchain company, and Goldman Sachs alumni Matthew Goetz started a cryptocurrency hedge fund. Will McDonough, who was hired by Cohn at Goldman Sachs, is also running a blockchain firm called iCash.While cryptocurrency has been a punching bag for some Wall Street CEOs, its underlying technology is widely applauded and some compare its potential to the internet. Others are still skeptical.

Coinbase says the group of 28 \u2014 and soon to be 27 \u2014 countries was its fastest-growing market last year.While it isn't moving resources away from the U.K. to prioritize Ireland, Coinbase's expansion echoes the sentiment among some big banks that are trying to increase their presence across Europe to offset the impact of Brexit. \"I think that played some part in the decision,\" Feroz said of uncertainty surrounding Brexit. He added that Ireland was a good fit for the firm, being an English-speaking country that is home to a diverse range of talent and a growing technology sector.Coinbase is currently hiring a number of customer support roles and a regulatory compliance position in the Irish capital, according to a job listing page on its website.Michael D'Arcy, minister of state at the department of finance in Ireland, said he was  \"delighted\" the firm was opening an office in Dublin. \"This decision highlights the competitive offering and attractiveness of Ireland for financial services,\" he said in a statement.The London office is the company's headquarters for Europe, as well as other international operations beyond the U.S. With a presence in Tokyo as well, the Dublin facility will be the start-up's third office outside the U.S. \"Dublin is a talent hotspot for companies like Coinbase as they scale and internationalize critical businesses operations,\" Martin Shanahan, CEO of IDA Ireland, the Irish state agency tasked with attracting overseas investment, said in a statement. \"We look forward to welcoming Coinbase into the Irish economy, and helping them access our talented pool of young professionals from the technology and financial services sectors.\"\n\nThe start-up saw a surge in users amid a rally in cryptocurrency prices late last year. In October 2017, it had 11.7 million users, representing an increase of almost 150 percent from the previous year. A month later, the firm acquired an additional 1.6 million users, lifting the total number of users to 13.3 million.Coinbase Chief Executive Brian Armstrong said in August that the company was growing by 50,000 customers every day in 2017.Earlier this month, Recode, citing unnamed sources, said the firm was looking to raise up to $500 million from Tiger Global and existing investors, in an investment that would value it at $8 billion. Feroz declined to comment on that report.In December, bitcoin, the world's largest digital coin by market value, surged to a record high near $20,000. However, the prices of major virtual currencies, as well as trading volumes, have plunged following last year's surge.Bitcoin has fallen almost 70 percent against the dollar since its all-time high, ether is off by 85 percent and XRP \u2014 a cryptocurrency promoted by blockchain firm Ripple \u2014 has shed nearly 90 percent, according to industry website CoinMarketCap.Huge volatility in the cryptocurrency market has drawn the attention of governments, bankers and serious investors, and heightened concerns around the speculative nature of the market.While Feroz said he doesn't comment on market speculation, he said it is a  \"young industry still finding its feet.\"\n", "birthday": "2018-10-15T23:04:13+0000", "date": "2018-10-15 23:04:13", "year": 2018, "month": 10, "day": 15}

Circle is buying up exchanges and startups in a bet that, despite this year's slump in prices, the crypto economy is here to stay.Its latest move was acquiring equity-fundraising start-up SeedInvest last week. That company until now had nothing to do with cryptocurrency and didn't seem like an obvious fit for Circle. But Circle founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire explained that it's a cornerstone for his bet that most of the existing financial system is going digital. \"If we zoom out, there's going to be this tokenization of everything,\" Allaire told CNBC in an interview at the Security Token Academy conference in Manhattan. \"Eventually these marketplaces will have tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of assets \u2014 so the next piece was a broker dealer,\" licensed and ready to go.Allaire's crypto bet has tricky timing. The SeedInvest deal comes just months after Circle bought a crypto exchange called Poloniex and introduced its own dollar-backed stable coin. Yet despite the investing public's enthusiasm for digital currencies \u2014 initial coin offerings last year raised the total cryptocurrency market cap to more than $816 billion \u2014 the value of these volatile digital tokens has been cut in half this year, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com.SeedInvest's crowdfunding strategy, as the CEO described it, is a  \"cousin\" to how cryptocurrencies raise money through ICOs. The New York-based company connects fellow start-ups with investors online. Its broker-dealer license was a key reason for the deal, which still needs to be approved by U.S. regulators.While some ICOs turned out to be frauds, the retail interest was a strong indicator that the crowdfunding method was here to stay, Allaire said. Circle decided to seek out a regulated partner like SeedInvest instead of applying for its own licenses or building one in-house. \"We're chasing a similar vision of changing the way businesses raise capital,\" said SeedInvest CEO Ryan Feit, who sits on the fintech committee of FINRA, the brokerage industry's regulator. \"It's a different form of enabling companies to raise money, and another form of alternative assets for investors.\"The crypto craze brought in billions from retail investors last year. That crowdfunding method has ushered in roughly $12 billion this year alone, according to the latest estimates from Autonomous Next. \"It was an incredible experiment in crowdfunding, and tokens and smart contracts as a new capital formation model,\" Allaire said. \"The growth in ICOs were really a pivotal moment for this concept of how can businesses issue digital investment contracts directly over the internet, from all around the world.\"Satya Bajpai, who leads blockchain and digital assets investment banking at JMP Securities, said the deal could be an example of what he calls an  \"acqui-hire,\" short for \"acquisition hiring,\" that's becoming popular as blockchain M&A picks up. In those cases, a company will buy another start-up to quickly gain employees along with its technology. \"It's hard to get good employees, and even harder to get employees who understand the technology and the business,\" said Bajpai, who advises technology and blockchain companies.SeedInvest's CEO disagreed with the  \"acqui-hire\" characterization.JMP's Bajpai pointed to a natural progression of equity crowd-fundraising going digital and eventually looking more like tokenized securities. In that case, it's possible that SeedInvest would have eventually moved toward the initial coin offering model on its own.Venture-backed Circle is one of the most highly valued cryptocurrency companies out there. It's profitable, according to Pitchbook, and brought in $110 million in its latest private fundraising round in May, which brought its valuation to $3 billion. Early investors include Goldman Sachs, bitcoin mining giant Bitmain, Breyer Capital, Oak Investment Partners, Accel and Pantera Capital.\nLaying the foundation\nBoston-based Circle bought cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex in February, which Allaire said it plans to  \"marry\" with the SeedInvest platform to issue tokens to high-net-worth as well as mom-and-pop investors.The Poloniex deal was more than a play on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Allaire explained. Circle is betting that even existing equities, such as stocks, will be  \"tokenized,\" enabling them to operate faster and more efficiently on blockchain technology.He used the example of Best Buy shares. The  \"token\" in this example would still be backed by Best Buy's stock, with the same price and underlying value. But the user could unlock other benefits in an actual Best Buy store, or add technology layers called \"smart contracts,\" that can do things like execute a transaction automatically. \"If people can exchange value over the internet without a toll extracted for payments it's pretty dramatic,\" Allaire said. \"It'll make the web look like a cute experiment comparatively speaking in 10 to 15 years.\"Despite his bullishness on crypto, Allaire isn't sure that people will buy and sell these equities using bitcoin. He said investors will still rely on regular money \u2014 it just needs to be able to operate on the same technology.So, Circle launched its U.S. dollar-backed  \"stable coin\" in May. Allaire said at the time there were \"a number of banks\" that were \"excited about it and will support it.\" The \"USD Coin\" as it's called, is not meant to replace the U.S. dollar, he explained. It's a way to take an existing dollar and make it compatible with the cryptocurrency infrastructure, which advocates say is better and faster than existing payment rails.The  \"stable coin\" also solves the problem of volatility, which has been a key reason bitcoin hasn't reached mainstream payment adoption and is seen more as a store of value.Circle announced a new mobile app for Poloniex this week and debuted  \"Circle Research\" to provide users with crypto asset-specific research, overall market research and insights. The new research will start with primers on certain cryptocurrencies and includes a weekly \"crypto recap\" on Fridays with news and analysis.In order for Circle's vision to really take hold, regulators need to be on board. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been clear that it sees all cryptocurrencies aside from bitcoin and ethereum (which are commodities) as securities. That distinction made it much easier for Circle to operate and informed some of its deal-making strategy, Allaire said. \"The SEC basically said, yes, this is legitimate, this is a new form of capital formation, but you've got to follow the rules,\" Allaire said. \"At the end of the day, you know, the ideas, the technology and the regulators have just got to meet in the middle.\"WATCH: How to start your very own cryptocurrency\nVIDEO3:1303:13How to start your very own cryptocurrencyDigital Original\n\n", "birthday": "2018-10-12T17:02:09+0000", "date": "2018-10-12 17:02:09", "year": 2018, "month": 10, "day": 12}

The exchange posted a response to the reports and reassured investors that  \"Bitfinex is not insolvent, and a constant stream of Medium articles claiming otherwise is not going to change this.\"Kelly highlighted also positive regulatory news out of Asia that may have aided bitcoin's recovery.

Regulators in Singapore meanwhile will help existing cryptocurrency firms set up local bank accounts, according to a report from Bloomberg.\nStock market correlation\nThose who have billed bitcoin as a store of value, or  \"digital gold,\" may have been especially disappointed by its performance this week. As bitcoin tumbled, the U.S. stock market also dropped as much as 1,300 points in two days, its biggest sell-off since February.Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency fund of hedge funds BitBull Capital, said the uncertainty around stocks bled into cryptocurrency markets. \"When we saw equity markets crumble, there was some fear in the cryptocurrency market as well,\" he said. \"I think there was an initial jolt due to larger market activity and the sell off.\"Bitcoin has been hovering between $6,000 and $8,000 since the beginning of summer. DiPasquale said more positive crypto-related news, like an investment from Yale's endowment, or an ETF winning approval could be the bump cryptocurrencies need need to break out of that range.The U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Community Affairs held a hearing on regulation this week, and multiple senators brought up concerns about the possibility for nefarious use cases like money laundering. But the most vocal crypto skeptic was economist Nouriel Roubini, who is nicknamed  \"Dr. Doom\" for predicting the 2008 financial crisis.Roubini called cryptocurrencies the  \"mother of all scams,\" and called its 50 percent losses this year \"crypto-apocalypse.\" The total market capitalization for cryptocurrencies is down by more than 60 percent, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com.Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Washington-based lobbying group Coin Center, took a starkly different stance.

But as discussed in detail below blockchain is the most over-hyped \u2014 and least useful \u2014 technology in human history,\" Roubini said. \"In practice it is nothing better than a glorified spreadsheet or database,\" he said.Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Washington-based lobbying group Coin Center, took a starkly different stance. While he acknowledged that it's not widely accepted as a payment method, Van Valkenburgh said that aspects of it are still promising. \"Is it perfect? No. Neither was email when it was invented in 1972,\" Van Valkenburgh said. \"The mere fact that it works without trusted intermediaries is amazing \u2014 it's a computer science breakthrough.

Bitcoin, meanwhile, has lost 54 percent of its value.As of Monday, 115 deals involving cryptocurrency or blockchain had been announced, on pace to hit 145 by the end of 2018. The count is up significantly from the 47 total deals completed last year, when bitcoin's price was surging to almost $20,000.While JMP didn't have data on the average size of the deals, since many of the details are private, the firm said a majority of the M&A transactions are global in nature and  \"relatively small\" at less than $100 million. The PitchBook data includes majority investments, partial liquidation and full acquisitions.Source: JMP Securities\nValues tied to bitcoin\nDuring this deal frenzy, cryptocurrencies have lost more than 65 percent of the total market capitalization and trading volumes have dropped 55 percent, according to CoinMarketCap.com. As digital assets linger in what some are calling  \"crypto winter,\" most token prices are still correlated to bitcoin, regardless of the underlying value of the company.Because of that, there seems to be a disconnect between value and valuation \u2014 early stage companies are being bought, or at least invested in, at discounted prices, according to JMP Securities' Satya Bajpai. \"You're seeing a mispricing of assets,\" Bajpai, who leads blockchain and digital assets investment banking at JMP, told CNBC in an interview. \"Even for great businesses, the value of the token remains correlated to bitcoin, which can create an ideal opportunity for strategic acquirers.\"\n'Land grab' for opportunities\nWhile bitcoin has been around for a decade, the rest of the cryptocurrency industry has really only started flourishing in the last two to four years. In order to keep up with the industry's breakneck pace, Bajpai said, companies are often forced to buy instead of build. Starting from scratch could simply take too long. \"It's expensive, but you get the technology and product immediately,\" Bajpai said. \"This industry is like a treadmill \u2014 the only way to keep up on a treadmill is to keep running by investing in new technology.\"The current strategy is a  \"land grab\" for innovative technology, access to new markets and intellectual property that can help these companies grow quickly, said Bajpai, who specializes in advising early stage companies or boards on M&A transactions.It may also be a land grab for talent. Blockchain engineers are hard to come by, and it's even harder to find employees with both business and technical backgrounds, Bajpai said. He pointed to Coinbase buying Earn.com, which lets users send and receive digital currency for replying to emails and completing tasks. As a part of that deal, Earn's founder and CEO became Coinbase's first-ever chief technology officer.Communities and users are another part of the strategy. Companies are able to add users, a key part of any tech start-up's valuation, almost immediately through an acquisition.The sector does present challenges, though. Valuations are complex, especially for companies that raised capital through an initial coin offering, or ICO. That method of crowdfunding often promises future use of a platform, some sort of payoff, or company ownership, in the form of a token. While institutional investors might be interested in buying the token associated with a project, it's more likely they'd want an equity stake in the company.To make it even more complicated, many of these deals are happening before these fledgling companies are able to prove themselves. \"As soon as a company becomes interesting, they get bought \u2014 the deal size may still remain small, but the number of deals will increase because that's the most viable and fastest way to grow in this environment.\"WATCH:\u00a0Bitcoin is disrupting the $45 billion art industry\nVIDEO1:3601:36Bitcoin is disrupting the $45 billion art industryDigital Original\n\n", "birthday": "2018-10-18T15:29:57+0000", "date": "2018-10-18 15:29:57", "year": 2018, "month": 10, "day": 18}

It administers $7.2 trillion in customer assets, has 27 million customers, and spends $2.5 billion per year on technology, partially through incubators that house its artificial intelligence and blockchain projects. The new digital asset company was born out of Fidelity Center for Applied Technology, or FCAT as employees call it.The new company will handle custody, or how to safely store digital assets. Crypto companies Coinbase, Gemini (run by the Winklevoss twins), BitGo, Ledger and ItBit are among those already working on similar solutions. Japanese bank Nomura also announced plans in May to offer crypto custody, and Goldman Sachs and Northern Trust are reportedly exploring custodial services. But until now, there's been a noticeable lack of a big U.S.-based incumbent like Fidelity officially entering the space.\n\nPart of the risk in cryptocurrency investing, which experts say has largely barred institutions from embracing these digital assets, is how to prevent them from being hacked. As of the end of June, $1.6 billion in cryptocurrency had been stolen from clients, according to CoinDesk's 2018 State of Blockchain Report.\nCybersecurity a focus\nFidelity has a long history of dealing with enterprise security, as well as public and private key cryptography to make sure it isn't part of that statistic. Its custody solution will include vaulted  \"cold storage,\" which involves taking the cryptocurrency offline, and multilevel physical and cyber controls, among other security protocols that have been created leveraging Fidelity's security principles from other parts of the business. \"You might look at the crypto world and say, 'Wow, is this a new thing?' but we've been managing key materials for a long time,\" Jessop said. \"We took our learnings in how to run enterprise security, then through our exploration of bitcoin and some of the people we've hired, quickly developed some of the crypto native expertise and federated the two of those things.\"\nFidelity techSource: Fidelity Investments\nDespite a slump in prices and news of hacks and fraud, acceptance among institutions for cryptocurrency is growing.Yale's well-known chief investment officer, David Swensen, who manages the school's $29.4 billion endowment, has invested in two funds dedicated to cryptocurrencies, sources told CNBC. Other endowments \u2014 for Harvard University, Stanford University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of North Carolina \u2014 have also reportedly made allocations in at least one cryptocurrency fund, The Information reported.The move by Fidelity may encourage more to do so.In addition to storing cryptocurrencies, Fidelity Digital Assets will use an existing internal crossing engine and smart order router for trade execution. This order router will allow Fidelity institutional customers to execute trades for bitcoin, ether and other assets at multiple market venues. While Jessop didn't say which ones, he said cryptocurrency exchanges have to comply with the same  \"Fidelity standard\" applied in other parts of the business. \"We have a pretty extensive onboarding procedure for these types of counterparties, which involves diligence on their financial strength as well as their regulatory procedures like 'know your customer' and anti-money laundering,\" he said. \"We are certainly only going to connect to those counterparties that we feel good about.\"\nVIDEO2:5202:52Bitcoin could break below $6,000, warns traderFutures Now\nFidelity's crypto ambitions\nJessop said the project is largely a result of Johnson's early interest. The CEO led the charge into cryptocurrency, one of the riskiest and most volatile asset classes of the past year, as early as 2014.Fidelity has a few existing cryptocurrency projects: It started bitcoin  \"mining\" at a location in New Hampshire when the digital asset's price was around $180, has a partnership with Coinbase that allows Fidelity customers to check their cryptocurrency balances on the Fidelity app, and in 2015, started facilitating charitable donations in bitcoin.Johnson  \"is very interested in this and stays up on developments in the space in quite a significant way,\" said Jessop, who joined Fidelity in January from cryptocurrency start-up Chain and before that spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs.The new standalone company, which has about 100 employees and will be headquartered in Boston, is in the process of onboarding its first clients now and will be in the market and  \"generally available\" sometime in early 2019.Cryptocurrency prices, meanwhile, are still struggling to recover. Bitcoin is down more than 50 percent this year and has yet to get back to its all-time high near $20,000.Still, Jessop said neither Fidelity nor institutions it services are distracted by price. He compared the technology's long-term potential with moving financial services to the internet. \"No one said when some of these early-stage Internet companies in 2000 were going out of business, 'Gee, the Internet is toast,'\" Jessop said. \"We don't focus too much on the price. It's a foundational technology \u2014 people are trying to get exposure to the trend and expect volatility in the assets themselves.\"WATCH: Bitcoin is stuck below $7,000, but one market watcher has a strategy to take advantage\nVIDEO3:3603:36Bitcoin is stuck below $7,000, but one market watcher has a strategy to take advantageFutures Now\n\n", "birthday": "2018-10-15T16:30:03+0000", "date": "2018-10-15 16:30:03", "year": 2018, "month": 10, "day": 15}

The phone can only be bought with cryptocurrency.HTC\nHTC unveiled its flagship blockchain-focused smartphone on Tuesday, the Exodus 1, as the struggling manufacturer looks to shift its strategy to focus on new technology.The Taiwanese phone maker said it developed its own cryptocurrency wallet called Zion to make its new phone function as a hardware cryptocurrency wallet.The Exodus 1 comes with a secure enclave \u2014 a secluded area on the phone's chip kept separate from the Android operating system (OS) it runs on \u2014 that uses technology made by SoftBank's Arm Holdings to keep a customer's cryptocurrency safe. \"Think of it as a micro OS that runs in parallel with Android,\" Phil Chen, HTC's decentralized chief officer, told CNBC over the phone. \"It basically is a wallet, but the wallet, what it does is hold your private keys.\" Private keys are lines of code which are meant to be known only to the owner of a cryptocurrency to allow them access to their funds.Chen said the benefit of keeping this area of the phone separate from Android was that Google's OS is  \"fundamentally insecure with a centralized system,\" and therefore storing cryptocurrency using Android would make a user's funds more vulnerable to a hack.He said the significance of integrating blockchain technology in the phone is that it bolsters the security and privacy of a user's assets, and will in the future help with protecting a customer's data and identity. Blockchain can be thought of as a tamper-proof digital ledger that records cryptocurrency transactions and other data across a distributed network with no central authority overseeing it. \"The dominant companies in our world today are Google and Facebook, and in China, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, because they basically own all our data, \" Chen said.\nHTC's \"blockchain phone,\" the Exodus 1. The phone can only be bought with cryptocurrency.HTC\n \"And the reason why you do a blockchain phone is ... for everybody just to own their own keys. Everything starts there. When you start owning your own keys, then you can start owning your own digital identity, then you can start to own data.\"HTC's new phone will run decentralized applications, digital programs that operate on the blockchain. It also comes with a  \"Social Key Recovery\" function that lets a user regain access to their funds if they lose their private key via a select number of trusted contacts.Other than its blockchain features, the Exodus 1 also includes:A 16 megapixel dual main camera and an 8MP dual front camera with 4K video.A six inch display with quad-HD+ resolution.A Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor.Six gigabytes of RAM and 128GB of storage.HTC's early access Exodus 1 is available for pre-order at a price of 0.15 bitcoins or 4.78 ether tokens, which translates to about $960, and is expected to be shipped by December. That huge price tag places it on similar footing with premium smartphones in the market like Apple's iPhone XS and Samsung's Galaxy Note 9.\nVIDEO1:2701:27HTC on its upcoming blockchain phoneSquawk Box Asia\nBut it's important to take note of the cryptocurrency market's notoriety for volatility; bitcoin's price, for example, has been known to climb or fall hundreds of dollars in value within hours. \"It's definitely important that there's this excitement and this huge crypto bubble and people are paying attention and buying bitcoin and ether,\" HTC's Chen told CNBC. \"But is this the most important thing? Is this the reason why we're doing this blockchain phone? No.\"Chen rebutted concerns that the exclusivity of the phone's availability to cryptocurrency holders would shut out some of HTC's core audience. \"Selling it in crypto only and being the first to do so means we are bringing this directly to the core audience and those who will want this device \u2014 the blockchain community,\" he said. Chen pointed out that HTC is inviting third party cryptographers and developers to give it feedback on phone.HTC \u2014 once a powerhouse in the cellphone industry \u2014 has seen its status dwindle in recent years, with competitors like Apple and Samsung winning over market share, and Chinese rivals like Huawei and Xiaomi climbing in the ranks of the world's largest phone vendors. The 2008 HTC Dream was the first commercially released smartphone to run on Android.With a decline in its own phone sales, and a broader slowdown for the industry, HTC has diversified its business, branching out into virtual reality for instance with the HTC Vive, in partnership with gaming firm Steam.The biggest sign that the company was trimming back its phone business came earlier this year when it struck a $1.1 billion deal with Google to move 2,000 of its employees to the U.S. tech giant \u2014 most of whom had worked on Google's flagship Pixel phones \u2014 and to give it a non-exclusive license for HTC's intellectual property.\n\nIt has also recently cut a significant chunk of its global workforce, with its total headcount decreasing to 5,822 from the 7,322 employees it had in March.HTC's Chen told CNBC the focus on blockchain was part of the firm's shifting strategy regarding smartphones, which he said will prioritize software and intellectual property. \"We believe blockchain is the new paradigm for smartphones and it will form part of HTC's wider smartphone strategy,\" Chen told CNBC. \"This marks a change in HTC, with increased focus on software and IP.\"HTC is not alone in developing a blockchain phone though. Start-up Sirin Labs has plans of its own for a $1,000 blockchain-based phone called Finney, which it expects to release before November. \"I think they are trying to find a niche and set an example of how they can integrate new technologies within the phone,\" Neel Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC over the phone. \"So I think it could be the start of (HTC) attracting more investors, or attracting new OEMs (original equipment manufacturers).\"As for the roughly $960 price tag, Shah said it did seem fairly high, but that it was appropriate given HTC was targeting people in the cryptocurrency space. \"I think it could be slightly high but I think it would also be a fair price tag if they're targeting that particular segment, because they are trading and have made money off blockchain technology,\" he said.\n", "birthday": "2018-10-23T08:45:42+0000", "date": "2018-10-23 08:45:42", "year": 2018, "month": 10, "day": 23}

Indeed, we would argue that further falls are highly probable.\"Other cryptocurrencies have struggled alongside bitcoin. The total market capitalization for cryptocurrencies is down more than 60 percent this year, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com.Holden pointed to other issues: There is a decline in the base of individuals who are willing to pay inflated prices for cryptocurrencies, credit card companies have banned customers from paying for bitcoin on a card, and social media sites have banned initial coin offering advertising. \"Taken together, this means that there is likely to be less demand, with less funds available to invest in Bitcoin,\" Holden said.The researcher also highlighted bitcoin's potential as a means for money laundering and buying illegal substances and its persistent volatility as a roadblock to gaining mainstream acceptance.Still, others are more bullish on its underlying technology, blockchain.

The fintech company, valued at $3 billion in its most recent funding round, has made a series of deals and announcements in a long-term bet that despite bitcoin's price slump, the crypto economy is here to stay.The  \"USD Coin\" was one of those bets, and as of Tuesday it will trade on Coinbase's popular cryptocurrency exchange. This is the first time Coinbase has supported a stablecoin, which it said is \"fundamentally different\" from other cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin's price has fluctuated wildly since its rise to nearly $20,000 last year, making it almost impossible to use as a viable payment alternative. A stablecoin like Circle's USD Coin, in comparison, is meant to represent a single U.S. dollar. It is a 1:1 representation of the greenback, just built on the ethereum blockchain. Each USD Coin is collateralized by a corresponding U.S. dollar, held in accounts subject to regular public reporting of reserves, Circle said. \"We see USDC as a major step towards a more open financial system. The advantage of a blockchain-based digital dollar \u2013 like USDC \u2013 is that it is easier to program, send, use in apps, and store locally than traditional US dollars,\" Coinbase, reportedly valued at $8 billion, said in a blog post.Other Stablecoins have proved to be less than stable. Earlier in October, the price of Tether, which is also meant to be pegged to the U.S. dollar, plummeted below 90 cents after reports that the Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange was insolvent. Critics of Tether have called into question whether that cryptocurrency is truly backed by the equivalent amount of U.S. dollars.Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire has made multiple long-term bets on the future of cryptocurrency. But he's not certain trades or investments in the future crypto economy will be done in bitcoin. He recently told CNBC that investors will still rely on government-backed money \u2014 it just needs to be able to operate on the same blockchain technology.Circle's USD Coin is not meant to replace the U.S. dollar, Allaire explained \u2014 it's a way to take an existing dollar and make it compatible with the cryptocurrency infrastructure, which advocates say is better and faster than existing payment rails. \"If people can exchange value over the internet without a toll extracted for payments it's pretty dramatic,\" Allaire said at the October Security Token Academy conference in Manhattan.  \"It'll make the web look like a cute experiment comparatively speaking in 10 to 15 years.\"WATCH: The next stop in the cryptocurrency craze is a government-backed coin\nVIDEO2:4002:40Next stop in the cryptocurrency craze: a government-backed coinGlobal Investing Hot Spots\n\n", "birthday": "2018-10-23T16:05:29+0000", "date": "2018-10-23 16:05:29", "year": 2018, "month": 10, "day": 23}

It can't be altered.Duran compared it to a digital version of the book log used at a library, where you can see who borrowed a book and who returned it. \"Blockchain itself is going to be part of every transaction that occurs in the world,\" he said. \"It's going to take a decade before it's there.\"Here's what's ahead for the new technology.\nBroader use\nA survey from PricewaterhouseCoopers revealed that 84 percent of executives polled said that their companies are  \"actively involved\" with blockchain.The firm polled 600 executives in 15 territories.More from Straight Talk: Watch out for these risks investing in bitcoin Understanding  \"don't put all your eggs in one basket\" investing With assets risk matters, but it's really all about locationMost investors won't necessarily invest directly in the burgeoning technology, but they can likely count on it being an active part of financial transactions in the future. \"Digital currency is the future of money \u2014 there is no doubt about it,\" Duran said.One possibility we may see is that governments will begin using blockchain as a way to track the use of its currency, he said.\n \nSign Up for Our Newsletter Your Wealth \n Weekly advice on managing your money\n SIGN UP NOW\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and services.

Bitcoin, sometimes referred to as  \"digital gold,\" and other top cryptocurrencies wiped out $13 billion of value in a matter of hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com.Other top cryptocurrencies followed bitcoin's lead, with XRP and ethereum both tumbling more than 10 percent. The downward moves came after the International Monetary Fund warned that cryptocurrencies  \"could create new vulnerabilities in the international financial system.\"Bitcoin proponents have billed it as a store of value, or  \"digital gold,\" and a possible replacement for traditional currencies.This week's market plunge, and this year's global turmoil, should have made ideal conditions for digital currencies to prove that. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed more than 800 points lower Wednesday, its biggest loss since February, hurt by quickly rising interest rates and a rout in tech stocks.While U.S. stock market has otherwise fared pretty well this year, government-backed currencies were dragged down by ongoing Brexit concerns in 2018, and there were growing trade tensions between the U.S., China and European Union.Yet, the world's largest cryptocurrency is down 55 percent since the beginning of this year and more than 67 percent since nearing the $20,000 mark in December. Regulatory crackdowns and news of hacks on global exchanges contributed to those declines.\n if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"ieroh\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"ieroh\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":453,\"200\":427,\"300\":427,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"ieroh\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-ieroh\"),window.datawrapper[\"ieroh\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"ieroh\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"ieroh\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"ieroh\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"ieroh\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"});\nBitcoin's failure to make a comeback amidst the global turmoil has been a warning sign for one researcher. In a new report this week, U.K.-based Juniper highlighted bitcoin's inability to rally as a hint of more bad news to come. \"If Bitcoin cannot make gains in such favourable circumstances, then it is unlikely to prosper as and when these issues are resolved,\" Juniper researcher Windsor Holden said in the study published Tuesday. \"We feel that the industry is on the brink of an implosion.\"For those not as bullish on digital gold, real gold hasn't proved to be a much better option this year. The precious metal had fallen about 13 percent since hitting a peak in April, with investors relying on the safety of the U.S. dollar as a trade war with China unfolded, against a backdrop of rising U.S. interest rates. But gold has recovered from a low hit in mid-August, spurred by concerns over economic growth and inflationary pressure from soaring oil prices.U.S. gold futures saw slight bump after the market collapsed, up 1.1 percent Thursday morning and about 0.5 percent higher for the week.WATCH:\u00a0Is a bitcoin breakout eminent?\nVIDEO4:3504:35Is a bitcoin breakout eminent?Futures Now\n\n", "birthday": "2018-10-11T13:18:55+0000", "date": "2018-10-11 13:18:55", "year": 2018, "month": 10, "day": 11}

It ended 500 points higher on Thursday after plummeting a day earlier, then on Friday dropped more than 500 points after some disappointing quarterly results from key tech companies. It later recovered some of that drop.Fears of an ongoing trade war and rising interest rates added to the sell-off. But Bitcoin's insulation from the market wreckage is relatively new.Earlier in October, uncertainty around stock markets bled into cryptocurrencies as the Dow dropped as much as 1,300 points in two days, its biggest sell-off since February. Bitcoin dropped 6 percent as the total cryptocurrency market during that time lost $18 billion of its value.Bitcoin has lost more than 65 percent of its value since nearing a high of $20,000 last year, when retail investors were fanatically pouring into the asset class. The cryptocurrency is still up 14 percent year over year, and was trading near $6,483 Friday, according to CoinDesk.Its volatility has made it almost impossible to use as a viable payment method. Instead bitcoin has been billed as a store of value, or  \"digital gold.\" That safe haven use case also seemed unlikely at certain points this year, as it fell alongside major stock markets.Gold, a more established safe-haven asset, was up 0.6 percent this week.\nBitcoin simmers down\nWhen the markets capsized in early February, bitcoin lost more than 33 percent of its value in two days, dropping from above $9,000 to below $6,000 in 24 hours. But it seems to be entering a new chapter with lower volatility and far fewer price swings.This month, bitcoin has seen only one day with a 5 percent move or more, according to data from CoinDesk.

Ether, the second largest in the asset class, is up 0.2 percent while XRP is up 0.4 percent. Still, Brian Kelly, CEO and founder of BKCM, said crypto investors are mostly separated from what's happening in the broader markets. \"I don't know of anyone saying 'Microsoft dropped, I better sell bitcoin to cover my margin',\" Kelly told CNBC.The relentless selling after bitcoin hit $19,000 last year has slowed down, and Kelly said bitcoin seems to have finally found a bottom at $6,000. While retail interest may be  \"washed out,\" the market is waiting on a wave of institutional buyers, which Kelly said is \"coming but it's slow.\"Institutions are increasingly embracing the new asset class. Fidelity launched a custody solution for institutional buyers, which was seen as a missing factor many investors to enter the market.

The deal marks a massive increase from its previous valuation, which had been $1.6 billion as of August 2017.The Series E round was led by Tiger Global Management, with participants including Andreessen Horowitz, Y Combinator Continuity, Wellington Management and Polychain.Coinbase plans to use the funds to  \"accelerate the adoption of cryptocurrencies and digital assets,\" Coinbase President and Chief Operating Officer Asiff Hirji said in a statement.The company, the best known U.S. cryptocurrency trading platform, is seen as a poster child for the fledgling industry.

But institutional investors seem to be picking up that slack, and led the world's largest digital currency investment firm to notch record inflows this year.New York- based Grayscale, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, brought in $81.1 million in total investments for the third quarter, according to a company report published Thursday. The 33 percent uptick from the previous three months brings Grayscale's inflows for the year to $330 million, its strongest year-to-date total since the firm started five years ago. At this time last year, the firm had raised a total $25.4 million by comparison. The firm now has $1.5 billion in customer assets. \"Bitcoin prices doing nothing but go down the entire year has not deterred our existing clients from putting more capital to work,\" Michael Sonnenshein, managing director of Grayscale Investment, told CNBC. \"Asset inflows are really strong despite these price declines.\"Of those inflows, roughly 70 percent were from institutional investors, meaning hedge funds, pensions or endowments. Grayscale's nine cryptocurrency products are only available to accredited investors, not retail buyers who helped boost prices 1,300 percent last year. Grayscale's other clients are mostly high net-worth individuals or family offices.Despite the rise of smaller alternatives like ether or XRP known as  \"alt coins,\" bitcoin is still \"king\" of cryptocurrencies for investors, Grayscale said,In the third quarter, 73 percent of inflows were into the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which trades on over the over-the-counter markets under the ticker GBTC. Despite being  \"king,\" bitcoin is still down more than 55 percent this year and was trading near $6,300 Thursday, according to data from CoinDesk.\nAffordable entry\nSonnenshein, a former J.P. Morgan associate, said the slump has been positive for those waiting for a lower price after bitcoin's climb above $19,000 last December. \"Investors are taking the pullback as an opportunity to increase their exposure,\" Sonnenshein said. \"The price has not slowed down the pace of investments \u2014 it's actually caused us to broaden our relationships.\"Not only is there more interest from institutions, there's more understanding, Sonnenshein said. Grayscale is no longer teaching  \"Bitcoin 101\" during meetings, he said. Instead, conversations tend to be focused on appropriate allocation sizes, what's going on with scaling, transaction growth and much more \"thoughtful dialogue around the state of the industry.\"Although it didn't quantify it in the report, Grayscale said it did see a  \"slight deceleration\" of investments coinciding with the \"summer slowdown.\" The Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust, or GBTC, has historically traded at a premium to bitcoin and is down about 70 percent this year.Institutions had mostly stayed on the sidelines during the cryptocurrency and initial coin offering mania of 2017. Security, news of fraud and regulatory uncertainty were among the major deterrents. But historically careful investors are slowly embracing the new industry.Yale endowment's widely followed chief investment officer David Swensen has invested in at least two venture capital funds that deal in cryptocurrency and its underlying technology blockchain. While it's not clear that those investments are in bitcoin itself, the reports were seen as a bullish sign for the industry's future.

Morgan named three public companies who are potential long-term winners in the emerging technology.The firm predicted software companies will use blockchain in a similar way to how many currently claim the benefit of machine learning and artificial intelligence. But there are few that J.P. Morgan says will create  \"material incremental growth opportunities\" from the technology. \"Investors should be looking to identify where the opportunity to replace a middleman is the biggest, or where trust is needed where none exists, or what companies are the best positioned to offer blockchain as a service,\" J.P. Morgan software equity research analyst Sterling Auty said in a note to clients Thursday.J.P. Morgan's bets for that disruption are  \"middleman displacement opportunities\" and \"Blockchain as a Service,\" which the firm calls \"BaaS.\" In the bank's coverage at least three names fit that criteria \u2014 Akamai, DocuSign and Ellie Mae.Cloud service provider Akamai, rated  \"overweight\" by J.P. Morgan, could leverage the \"BaaS\" approach. \"Rather than building from scratch we see customers looking to utilize a vendor like Akamai that offers its Blockchain capabilities as a service,\" Auty said. \"While there are a number of companies that have blockchain technology, IBM as one example, we believe the sizeable Akamai network is an inherent advantage in running a distributed ledger in blockchain.\"In this case, J.P. Morgan is advocating for use of closed, permissioned blockchain, also known as just  \"private.\" Bitcoin by comparison, is the biggest  \"public\" blockchain meaning anyone can join or participate in that network. Its \"distributed ledger,\" where transactions are recorded can also be seen by just about anyone.DocuSign already offers the ability to connect a blockchain network to its systems. The company, which J.P. Morgan also rated  \"overweight,\" could leverage both private and public blockchains. \"DocuSign wants to be the platform to enable the entire contracting process in a digital manner. Over time we could see much of the platform being based on blockchain, basically shifting itscentralized security model for the distributed model of blockchain, \" J.P.

The profit per month is down for mining from about $150 last summer, to an estimated $0 for November of this year, according to analysis by Susquehanna.In mining, machines run 24 hours a day, competing against other computers around the world to solve complex math problems. The first computer, or multiple computers, to solve the problem earns a fixed amount of bitcoin or ethereum.The  \"hashrate,\" or speed at which a computer can complete that operation fell drastically for ethereum this year. A higher hashrate is better for miners and adds to the opportunity of finding the next \"block\" and therefore getting the reward of new cryptocurrency.The value of ethereum meanwhile has dropped more than 70 percent this year, trading near $205 Tuesday, according to data from CoinDesk.The combination of those factors means that mining ethereum using a GPU, Nvidia's flagship graphics card, is  \"no longer profitable,\" Susquehanna semiconductor analyst Christopher Rolland said in a note to clients Tuesday.\nHurting Nvidia\nChipmaker Nvidia is losing sales as a result. The company's crypto-related revenue is down roughly $100 million quarter over quarter, Rolland said. He predicted that the company's cryptocurrency-related revenue will be  \"likely close to zero\" in its third-quarter report out Thursday. \"We estimate very little revenue from crypto-related GPU sales in the quarter, consistent with management's prior commentary that they were including no contribution from crypto in their C3Q18 outlook,\" Rolland said. \"3Q18 mining profitability continued to decline, as Ethereum prices have fallen more than -70% since the beginning of 2018.\"Nvidia was a major beneficiary of the cryptocurrency boom late last year as miners relied on Nvidia's graphics cards. That process was a money-maker when bitcoin rose to nearly $20,000 last year, and ethereum rose more than 8,000 percent. But as prices have fallen drastically in 2018, so has the chip-maker's ability to profit off of digital assets.Strength in cryptocurrency mining boosted Nvidia's stock earlier this year. In February, shares surged after its fourth-quarter report, which beat Wall Street's expectations, showed big demand in cryptocurrency. The chip stock has gotten pounded since, especially during the October's market correction. The stock is down 23 percent in the last one month and is now in the red for the year.Nvidia reports third quarter earnings after the bell Thursday. Rolland said the company's earnings report, especially its forecast for the current quarter, is likely to disappoint Wall Street this week. He's upgrading the stock to the firm's  \"positive\" rating from neutral, but still lowered his price target to $230 from $250.WATCH: These college students are mining cryptocurrency in their dorm rooms\nVIDEO3:1503:15These college students are mining cryptocurrency in their dorm roomsDigital Original\n\n", "birthday": "2018-11-13T18:44:16+0000", "date": "2018-11-13 18:44:16", "year": 2018, "month": 11, "day": 13}

Still, bitcoin's current levels are well above the fraction of a penny where it first began trading \u2014 and its true believing investors are mostly richer because of it.The first and most famous digital currency sparked mania among retail investors last year. Despite being founded to bypass them, it has caught the attention of some of the world's most powerful institutions.\nFinding Satoshi\nPerhaps the most confounding thing about bitcoin is its origin story. It was invented by an anonymous cryptographer going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. He, she or they wrote bitcoin's founding white paper a decade ago on Halloween, claiming online to be a Japanese man. But some speculated that was unlikely, based on Satoshi's perfect English and bitcoin's software not being labeled in Japanese.The conspiracy theories and clues are endless. British spellings and phrases such as  \"bloody hard\" on online forums hinted that Satoshi was English, while time stamps from emails suggested that the founder could be American, Irish or Finnish. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is among those who have been suspected of being Satoshi, though he denied it. Multiple others \"admitting\" to being the founder have since been discredited. The code is so impressive, others say, that it must have been written by multiple people.As bitcoin started to gain popularity, Satoshi emailed a fellow bitcoin developer, saying the founder had  \"moved on to other things.\" Satoshi went radio silent on public forums by 2011 and passed the reins to Gavin Andresen, a software engineer, who became the chief developer of the open code that refines the bitcoin protocol. But Satoshi didn't walk away empty-handed. Sergio Demian Lerner, an Argentine researcher, has estimated that Satoshi accumulated around 1 million bitcoins before disappearing.Today, that stash is worth over $6.2 billion.\nVIDEO6:2306:23Bitcoin\u2019s origin story remains shrouded in mystery. Here's why it mattersDigital Original\nBitcoin's original goal, according to its white paper, was straightforward: A  \"purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.\" Satoshi's idea solved the \"double spending\" problem that other failed digital currencies, like e-Cash or DigiCash in the 1990s, ran into.In order to make sure payments didn't need a third party such as a bank, bitcoin would rely on  \"distributed ledgers,\" which could be seen by anyone to verify that the money actually changed hands. The network records transactions and puts them onto an ongoing chain, forming a record that can't be altered. That technology is widely known as blockchain and is now being applied to industries such as health care, farming and mortgages.\nBitcoin goes live\nIt began gaining traction in online forums, and by 2009 the first 50 bitcoins, known as the  \"Genesis block,\" were mined. Mining is the energy-consuming process, done on high-powered computers, to solve math equations that confirm transactions on that public ledger. The first-ever bitcoin transaction took place just over a week later from Satoshi to late software developer Hal Finney.\nVIDEO0:5300:53Happy birthday bitcoin: The cryptocurrency is turning tenCryptocurrency\nIn order to trade bitcoin, the first exchange, called  \"dwdollar,\" came on the scene. A few months later, the first real-world transaction in bitcoin took place. At the time it had no real value. But a Jacksonville, Florida, programmer paid 10,000 bitcoins for a pizza in May 2010, which at the time, using bitcoin's newly established exchange rate, was worth about $25, according to CoinDesk. At October 2018 prices, he would have paid $63 million for that pizza.By the end of 2010, it was emerging as a real currency with the first mobile transaction and its total value topping $1 million.\nMt.Gox & Silk Road\nMt.Gox put bitcoin on the map \u2014 but not in a way some would have hoped. The Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange launched in 2010, and three years later it was handling roughly 70 percent of all cryptocurrency transactions in the world. The site was founded by Jed McCaleb, who later went on to found crypto projects Ripple and Stellar. But he sold before it went under.The site experienced its first of multiple hacks in 2011, when bitcoin reached a price milestone of $1. It was later effectively frozen out of the U.S. banking system for regulatory issues, and by 2013 stopped trading, closed its website and filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\nSilk Road was another smudge on bitcoin's reputation. The dark web marketplace facilitated transactions for guns, drugs and other illicit goods, mostly with bitcoin. Bitcoin became known as the currency of choice for criminals, which is still how it's categorized by those who doubt bitcoin's place in modern finance.The digital currency plunged after U.S. law enforcement officials shut down Silk Road. In 2015 the site's creator, Ross Ulbricht, was sentenced to life in prison. Many expected demand to dry up after the website was closed. But in the following years, the opposite seemed to happen.For some, the government seizures in those years presented an opportunity to buy. Venture Capitalist Tim Draper was among those who bought bitcoin in government auctions after Mt.Gox closed down, and has since called it  \"the greatest technology since the internet.'' Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss, the twins who famously battled Mark Zuckerberg over the origins of Facebook, bought the cryptocurrency in 2013. Bitcoin made it to almost $1,000 that year, but it took until 2017 to actually break that price threshold.Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, recently valued at $8 billion, was founded around the same time, in 2012. BitPay, the largest merchant services provider, started in 2011 and opened up a space for merchants to start accepting bitcoin.The currency made its way from the digital to physical world with the first-ever bitcoin ATM at a Vancouver coffee shop by 2013. But aside from gimmicks, bitcoin's use as a real currency hasn't truly caught on. A key part of that is volatility, since the cryptocurrency's value is known to whiplash by hundreds of dollars in a single day.Still, Overstock.com, Newegg, Expedia, Microsoft, Dish Network, OKCupid, CheapAir and Etsy are among the companies that have historically accepted bitcoin for certain payments.\nLuke MacGregor\u00a0 | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nMarch to $20,000\nBy 2017, investors were using bitcoin more as a speculative bet than as a vehicle for buying pizza. It has been compared to digital gold \u2014 with a limited supply (21 million exist, and of that, roughly 17 million have been mined) and potential as an alternative investment and a safe-haven currency in turbulent times for stock markets. That use case seems less likely, though, as bitcoin has struggled to recover to its high even among trade wars, Brexit concerns and struggling global currencies.\nVIDEO2:0002:00Bitcoin could be the biggest bubble in history \u2013 here's howDigital Original\nMany retail investors were driven by FOMO, or  \"fear of missing out,\" at the end of last year. Bitcoin began last year below $1,000 and by December was trading above $19,000, bringing its total gains to 1,300 percent, according to CoinDesk. Those gains brought in a new era of crypto millionaires, who in some cases, publicized their gains and Lamborghinis on Twitter. It has since dropped more than 60 percent and was trading above $6,300 as of the end of Friday's trading session.\nFutures\nBitcoin's all-time high coincided with the launch of what many hoped would make it mainstream \u2014 a futures market. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or CME, introduced bitcoin futures trading on Dec. 17. That same day, bitcoin hit a peak price of $19,783, according to data from CoinDesk. The Chicago Board Options Exchange, or CBOE, also opened a futures market, a week earlier. \"Futures\" let an investor bet that the price will hit a certain level without having to buy the asset itself. The Intercontinental Exchange, parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, plans to introduce another form of futures in December through a new joint venture called Bakkt, also supported by Starbucks and Microsoft.\nVIDEO2:0002:00If you own bitcoin, here's how much you owe in taxesAdvisor Insight\nInitial coin mania\nAs bitcoin's value climbed, other cryptocurrencies and a fundraising method known as initial coin offerings, or ICOs, climbed with it. An ICO is a fundraising method in which a start-up, usually blockchain-based, raises money to build a business. Typically, all that is needed is a website landing page and an idea laid out in a white paper. The  \"tokens\" or cryptocurrencies sold through ICOs promise a future payoff, or, in the case of ethereum, are used to access the actual blockchain platform. The fundraising method started in 2013, but was made famous last year as it brought in billions from retail investors.Thanks to ICOs, there are more than 2,000 cryptocurrencies in existence, according to CoinMarketCap.com. Many have failed since their inception, but the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization has managed to climb above $200 billion \u2014 bitcoin makes up more than half of that total, with a market value of about $113 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.com.ICO crowdfunding has raked in $12 billion this year alone, more than the total initial public offerings on major U.S. exchanges, according to the latest data from Autonomous Next. Many were outed as frauds and subpoenaed by U.S. regulators who repeatedly warned of  \"pump and dump\" schemes. The Securities and Exchange Commission even launched its own scam ICO website to show investors how to avoid falling for one.Tech companies Google, Facebook, and Twitter banned cryptocurrency advertisements earlier this year, also citing an effort to protect retail investors from fraud.\nRegulation\nThe popularity ushered in new buyers and the attention of regulators.Since it's not backed by a single government, no single entity is in charge of overseeing bitcoin. Each country and even different states within those countries have fragmented rules on how they treat the new asset class. Global regulators are still reconciling how to handle  \"know your customer\" and anti-money-laundering requirements, while not cracking down too hard on what could be an innovative new asset class.The Securities and Exchange Commission has explicitly said that bitcoin and ether, linked to another blockchain platform launched in 2015, are commodities. But it said all other initial coin offerings are securities and therefore should be regulated by the SEC.While industry leaders have increasingly called for more clarity, SEC Commissioner Jay Clayton has said he does not plan to change the rules for crypto. A law change would take an act of Congress, which members of the House left as an open possibility in their September letter to the SEC.\nWall Street\nWall Street has slowly but surely accepted bitcoin as a mainstream investment.Goldman Sachs CFO Martin Chavez said the bank is working on a bitcoin derivative known as a  \"non-deliverable forward,\" because of demand from clients. The bank's now former CEO Lloyd Blankfein tweeted in October that Goldman was \"still thinking about bitcoin\" and that the bank was \"not endorsing/rejecting.\" Goldman Sachs has been clearing bitcoin-linked futures contracts offered by the CBOE and CME since May and is providing clients liquidity for those futures.As for physical bitcoin, Goldman is not quite there yet. Its CFO underlined the need for a safe custody solution before the bank could move forward. Since those comments, though, Fidelity has stepped in to fill that void. It announced a custody solution, and New York regulators approved Coinbase's own custody solution last week.The new industry has seen more and more collaboration between Wall Street and native cryptocurrency companies themselves. Seventy-two-year-old Fidelity, which thanks to its crypto-friendly CEO has been an early leader in the space, teamed with Coinbase so customers could see their crypto balances.Nasdaq announced a collaboration with cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, founded by the Winklevosses. The deal gave Gemini access to Nasdaq's surveillance technology to help provide a fair and  \"rules-based marketplace\" for their own participants. Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman said earlier this year the company was  \"open to becoming a crypto exchange.\" She told CNBC in April that once the space \"matures,\" Nasdaq would consider becoming a digital-currency exchange \u2014 but for now, she says, it is more comfortable acting as a partner.Perhaps the biggest vote of confidence has been from notoriously careful institutional investors.Yale's endowment CIO David Swensen has invested in at least two venture capital funds that deal in blockchain and cryptocurrency. While it's not clear that those investments are in bitcoin itself, the reports were seen as a bullish sign for the industry's future.Despite the recent interest, the SEC has yet to approve a bitcoin ETF. The agency published a letter in January pointing to  \"significant investor protection issues that need to be examined\" before sponsors can offer these funds to retail investors.Those investors had been awaiting the approval of an ETF this summer, momentarily pushing prices above $8,000. But regulators have repeatedly held off, citing investor protection and potential for fraud or manipulation in the markets. In July, the Securities and Exchange Commission rejected a second attempt by the Winklevosses to list shares of what would be the first-ever bitcoin ETF.\nCriticism\nSome of Wall Street's most closely followed CEOs are less excited by the idea of bitcoin. J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called it a fraud. Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett, who has repeatedly warned against bitcoin, famously likened the cryptocurrency to  \"rat poison.\" Citadel's billionaire hedge-fund manager Ken Griffin is one of the many who have called out similarities between bitcoin and the most famous financial bubble of all time: the Dutch tulip bulb mania of the 1630s.Nouriel Roubini, nicknamed  \"Dr. Doom\" for predicting the financial crisis, is one of the biggest critics yet. He recently told U.S. senators at a hearing on Capitol Hill that \"crypto is the mother or father of all scams and bubbles.\"He also criticized bitcoin's underlying technology, blockchain, calling it the most  \"over-hyped \u2014 and least useful \u2014 technology in human history.\"\nBlockchain\nEven if bitcoin doesn't survive another 10 years, many on Wall Street are betting that its underlying technology will.J.P. Morgan Chase, IBM, Deloitte, Amazon and Facebook are among those working on private blockchain solutions for businesses, which for the most part have nothing to do with cryptocurrencies.\nVIDEO0:0000:00Here's why every industry should be looking at blockchainDigital Original\nMeanwhile, merger and acquisition activity for blockchain and cryptocurrency companies has more than doubled in the past year amid a 54 percent slump in bitcoin prices, according to JMP Securities and data from PitchBook.Executives now seem to be going through the same  \"FOMO\" for blockchain as retail investors experienced with bitcoin at the end of last year. In a report published by PwC in August, 84 percent of executives surveyed said their companies are \"actively involved\" with the technology. \"Everyone is talking about blockchain, and no one wants to be left behind,\" according to PwC's 2018 Global Blockchain Survey, which included 600 executives from 15 territories.\n", "birthday": "2018-10-31T11:20:01+0000", "date": "2018-10-31 11:20:01", "year": 2018, "month": 10, "day": 31}

Bitcoin had been trading comfortably around the $6,400 range for the majority of the fall, a stark contrast from the rest of its volatile trading year.Other cryptocurrencies fared even worse on Wednesday. Ether fell as much as 13 percent while XRP, the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, dropped 15 percent, according to CoinMarketCap.com.The rout is likely being spurred by uncertainty around bitcoin cash, according to founder and CEO of BKCM, Brian Kelly.That cryptocurrency was down 18 percent ahead of a  \"hard fork\" scheduled for November 15.

They have agreed to pay penalties, register their tokens as securities, file periodic reports with the agency and return funds to any harmed investors, according to the SEC.The settlement comes a week after the agency notched another  \"first,\" setting charges that a crypto firm called EtherDelta was operating as an unregistered exchange.The cases underscore the SEC's insistence that the relatively new digital financial products must follow traditional securities rules. \"We have made it clear that companies that issue securities through ICOs are required to comply with existing statutes and rules governing the registration of securities,\" Stephanie Avakian, the SEC's co-director of enforcement, said in a statement. \"These cases tell those who are considering taking similar actions that we continue to be on the lookout for violations of the federal securities laws with respect to digital assets.\"On Thursday, federal prosecutors in New York announced a guilty plea by a man who defrauded investors with two cryptocurrencies he founded during the initial coin offering boom.Maksim Zaslavkiy, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud after raising money for two virtual currencies known as  \"REcoin\" and \"Diamond.\" Zaslavskiy admitted to tricking investors into buying the digital tokens by claiming they were backed by real estate and diamonds.In reality, the certificates he sent to investors were not backed by blockchain technology. Zaslavskiy also had none of the promised jewels or land to back those investments, according a statement from the Department of Justice.Thirty nine-year-old Zaslavkiy tried earlier this year to dismiss the case against him by arguing that cryptocurrencies he created were not securities for the purpose of criminal law. That was shot down by a judge in Brooklyn in September.A key part of Zaslavkiy's argument at the time was that current laws around crypto are  \"unconstitutionally vague.\" U.S. district judge Raymond Dearie disagreed. The judge stopped short of defining RECoin and Diamond as securities, but Dearie did say the jury should be able to assess them using existing laws. \"The calculated lies of Zaslavskiy and others led unsuspecting investors who thought they were purchasing cryptocurrency securities to buy worthless certificates,\" United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement. \"This Office will continue to aggressively prosecute those who exploit and defraud investors, whether through traditional means of securities fraud, or new forms \u2013 such as the use of purported cryptocurrency offerings and blockchain technology.\"\nICO mania\nIn an ICO, coins or tokens are sold as a form of crowdfunding. Instead of voting rights or dividends that come with shares of a company, cryptocurrencies often promise access to a network, platform or service. But they're often backed by an abstract idea or nothing at all. That process has facilitated the rise of joke-cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, a Shiba Inu dog meme-turned-cryptocurrency that has a passionate following on Twitter and Reddit.ICO fundraising brought in billions from retail investors last year. In 2018 alone, companies have raised at least $9 billion through initial coin offerings, according to estimates from Autonomous Next. Many of those projects are backed by the promise of a future product or technology platform, while some are backed by nothing at all.In June, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton made it clear that the agency won't be updating the rules when it comes to defining this new digital asset class. As of Tuesday, bitcoin and ether are the only cryptocurrencies the SEC has explicitly said are exempt from Securities law.Clayton has also said that all other initial coin offerings constitute securities and  \"if it's a security, we're regulating it.\" \"We are not going to do any violence to the traditional definition of a security that has worked for a long time,\" Clayton told CNBC earlier this year. \"We've been doing this a long time, there's no need to change the definition.\"WATCH: There are plenty of gimmicky cryptocurrencies and regulators helping to find the bad players\nVIDEO3:2803:28There are plenty of gimmicky cryptocurrencies and regulators helping to find the bad playersDigital Original\n\n", "birthday": "2018-11-16T21:07:44+0000", "date": "2018-11-16 21:07:44", "year": 2018, "month": 11, "day": 16}

But by now, the party is over and the hangover is starting to set in.In its disappointing earnings report Thursday, Nvidia executives outlined a drop in revenue for the current quarter based on lack of demand for its gaming cards. Cryptocurrency mining had fueled demand for those chips late last year. But that has all but dried up as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies' prices nosedived and  \"mining\" for many of those is no longer profitable.These chips are now being sold on secondary markets, adding to surplus inventory, which weighed the company's fourth-quarter guidance. On a call with analysts following the report Thursday, CEO Jensen Huang said it could take up to two quarters to move through that additional inventory. \"The crypto hangover lasted longer than we expected,\" Huang said on a call with analysts following the earnings release.Shares fell 18 percent to a new 52-week low Friday, trading near $165.80. The price slide began after the company's third-quarter miss on sales and profits. Its outlook for the next few months also disappointed. Nvidia said it's expecting $2.7 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter \u2014 well below the Refinitiv consensus estimate of $3.4 billion. \"After many years of near flawless performance, NVDA finally stumbled as the fall-off in crypto demand and the resulting ballooning of inventory impacted its quarter and more severely impacted the guidance,\" Deutsche Bank said in a note to clients Friday. The firm cut its price target to $190 and maintains a hold rating on the stock.Executives gave an especially bleak forecast for cryptocurrency mining revenue. \"Whereas we had previously anticipated cryptocurrency to be meaningful for the year, we are now projecting no contributions going forward,\" Huang said.In mining, computers operate around the lock to compete against other machines to solve complex math problems. The first computer, or group of computers, to solve the problem earns a fixed amount of bitcoin or ethereum. Mining ethereum using a GPU, Nvidia's flagship graphics card, is  \"no longer profitable,\" Susquehanna semiconductor analyst Christopher Rolland said in a note to clients earlier this week. \"Crypto related inventories are playing a significantly more serious problem for Nvidia, and in the near-term may mask strong gaming and data center momentum,\" Rosenblatt Securities, which still has a buy rating and a $315 price target, said in a note to clients Friday.Earlier this year, Nvidia shares surged after solid fourth-quarter results, which beat Wall Street's expectations and were largely driven by demand in cryptocurrency. The chip stock has gotten pounded since, especially during the October's market correction.Despite the drop, Citi is bullish on other parts of the business. \"Net-net, while crypto impact is disappointing, underlying growth in gaming, data center, and auto markets remains on track,\" Citi said in a note to clients. \"As such, we remain buy-rated on the stock but are lowering our [target price] again to $244 from $270.\"\n", "birthday": "2018-11-16T15:04:02+0000", "date": "2018-11-16 15:04:02", "year": 2018, "month": 11, "day": 16}

That level is down to $7,000 from an earlier estimate of $8,000 for the S9 mining machine by Bitmain, according to Fundstrat's data science team. Based on that, Lee estimates that fair value for bitcoin would be roughly 2.2 times the new $7,000 break-even price.Bitcoin is trading well below that, near $5,539 on Friday, according to data from CoinDesk. This week, the majority of major cryptocurrencies saw double-digit downward swings, and bitcoin hit its lowest level of the year.\nVIDEO4:1304:13Widely followed analyst Tom Lee's big bitcoin calls from the past yearMarkets\nBut Lee is betting on a recovery. He told clients in a note Friday that even in the depths of a previous bitcoin bear market between 2013 and 2015, it  \"never sustained a move below breakeven.\" \"While bitcoin broke below that psychologically important $6,000, this has lead to a renewed wave of pessimism,\" said Lee, J. P. Morgan's former chief equity strategist. \"But we believe the negative swing in sentiment is much worse than the fundamental implications.\"Much of that price movement was driven by  \"crypto-specific\" events including the contentious argument over bitcoin cash, Lee said. This week, the cryptocurrency community sparred on Twitter over what's known as a \"hard fork\" of bitcoin cash. The digital currency split into two versions -- \"Bitcoin ABC,\" or core Bitcoin Cash, and \"Bitcoin SV,\" short for \"Satoshi's Vision.\" Bitcoin Cash itself is a result of a fork from bitcoin, after a disagreement on the best way to scale a digital currency.For much of October, bitcoin seemed immune to a sell-off in global financial markets. The cryptocurrency traded comfortably in the $6,400 range before falling off a cliff on Wednesday.Still, Lee is bullish on more institutional involvement bolstering prices into the end of this year. The launch of ICE, Starbucks and Microsoft-backed Bakkt and Fidelity entering the market is  \"part of a broader creation of infrastructure necessary for institutional involvement,\" he said.\n", "birthday": "2018-11-16T20:07:37+0000", "date": "2018-11-16 20:07:37", "year": 2018, "month": 11, "day": 16}

Bitcoin had been trading in the $6,400 range for the majority of October, a break from its volatility earlier this year, as the rest of global markets sold off. The cryptocurrency is now down more than 30 percent since last Thanksgiving.Its epic rise started right after the American holiday last year, as the cryptocurrency gained its status as a household name and became a common topic around dinner tables.

Peak prices lined up with the day the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or CME, introduced bitcoin futures trading on Dec. 17. The Chicago Board Options Exchange, or CBOE, opened a futures market a week earlier. Until futures existed it was extremely difficult, if not impossible, to bet on the decline of bitcoin prices.On Monday, both of those bitcoin futures hit their lowest level since they were introduced. Bitcoin CME futures fell as low as $5,015, while bitcoin contracts on the CBOE dropped to $4,990.Other major cryptocurrencies were mostly lower this week and have fared even worse than bitcoin this year. XRP, the second largest by market capitalization, fell 5 percent Monday, while ether dropped more than 13 percent, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. In the past week roughly $40 billion has been wiped off the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization, which was around $172 billion Monday.Analysts attributed bitcoin's continued sell-off to technical levels and stop orders in the market kicking in after bitcoin fell below $6,000. \"The next logical level of support is at $5,000 but if that doesn't hold, the next logical support level isn't until $3,500,\" eToro analyst Mati Greenspan said in a note to clients Monday. \"With all the falling prices lately, this definitely fits the definition of a buyers market.\"Others pointed to a split in the cryptocurrency bitcoin cash. That digital currency split into two versions last week \u2014  \"Bitcoin ABC\" and \"Bitcoin SV\" \u2014 which analysts said added to uncertainty in broader crypto markets.U.S. regulators made good on promises to regulate non-compliant cryptocurrency projects last week. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced its first civil penalties against crypto founders Friday as part of a bigger regulatory and legal crackdown aimed at abuses and outright fraud in the growing digital currency industry.SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said earlier this year that all cryptocurrencies aside from bitcoin and ether constitute securities and  \"if it's a security, we're regulating it.\" \"The SEC regulation last week spooked a lot of people,\" said Kyle Asman, partner and co-founder of crypto advisory firm BX3 Capital. \"Those who aren't sophisticated investors hear 'SEC' and they hit the sell button.\"The cryptocurrency tumble also comes after fresh warnings from European Central Bank Executive Board member Benoit Coeure at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, according to a report from Bloomberg News. \"Bitcoin was an extremely clever idea. Sadly, not every clever idea is a good idea,\" Coeure said Thursday. \"In more ways than one, bitcoin is the evil spawn of the financial crisis.\"Coeure also said he agrees with BIS head Agustin Carstens, who in June said,  \"Cryptocurrencies are, in a nutshell, a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster.\"Correction: This story has been changed to clarify that Benoit Coeure was quoting Agustin Carstens when he said on Thursday that bitcoin is  \"a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster.\"\n", "birthday": "2018-11-19T14:40:14+0000", "date": "2018-11-19 14:40:14", "year": 2018, "month": 11, "day": 19}

The cryptocurrency fell to a low of $180.60 after kicking off the year above $770.Investor enthusiasm for ether is fading. Mainstream adoption isn't here yet, investors can now bet against the market and blockchain competitors are gunning to be the top platform for developers.Ether is the name of the cryptocurrency, but it's closely associated with the popular Ethereum blockchain. Unlike bitcoin, which gives access to a global financial network, ether gives users access to a computer network. Its use has been compared to gasoline for a car. Developers can use ether tokens as fuel for certain functions on that blockchain.Analysts have pointed to the recent failure rate of initial coin offerings that were built on ethereum. Many have needed to sell part, if not all, of their holdings to manage cash flow and expenses. \"Ether's price was inflated earlier due to the ICO mania,\" said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency fund of hedge funds BitBull Capital. \"As people pledged Ether with ICOs, the supply-demand equation got skewed \u2014 now ICOs have cooled down, and hence the setback.\"Ethereum may have come first, but blockchain competitors like EOS and Stellar are moving in to dethrone it. The cryptocurrency is also dealing with short-sellers. Earlier this year, peer-to-peer trading platform BitMEX came up with a swap product that allows investors to bet against ether, which analysts say has dampened prices.The cryptocurrency's 2018 performance is a sharp contrast from last year. Investors were excited about its utility compared to bitcoin, which can't be used to build blockchain applications and is mostly seen as a speculative investment or a store of value.Even when bitcoin's price jumped to almost $20,000, ether was a better bet in 2017. Bitcoin rose 1,318 percent from Jan. 1 to the end of the year, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

The Gemini dollar, which has received approval from the New York Department of Financial Services, aims to maintain a value one on one with the U.S. dollar.The idea is to bridge the gap between the traditional banking system and the cryptocurrency market. While many people have bought digital currencies as investments, they don't use them to buy and sell goods. This latest move allows people to convert their U.S. dollars into Gemini dollars, and the reverse, and move capital around the world.

Interest has been slowly growing in fixed-price cryptocurrencies called stablecoins, which are pegged to a stable asset like gold or currency.Tether is currently the largest such coin, but it has faced criticism.Michael Moro, the chief executive officer of Genesis Global Trading, says his firm doesn't have exposure to stable coins yet.  \"Right now they're purely used on exchanges (arbitrage or crypto-to-crypto trading), but I think their potential use cases are much greater than just that,\" said Moro to CNBC.Winklevoss argues the stablecoins on the market until now had issues with transparency and oversight. \"I don't think any of the offerings do adequate job in solving the trust problem.

But Dearie did say the jury should be able to assess them using existing laws. \"Though 'investment contract' has not been defined by Congress, the test for whether a \"given financial instrument or transaction constitutes an 'investment contract' under the federal securities laws,\" has long been settled,\" Dearie said.Whether an asset is a security right now follows the  \"Howey Test.\" The ruling comes from a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court case that classifies a security as an investment of money in a common enterprise, in which the investor expects profits primarily from others' efforts.SEC Chairman Jay Clayton made it clear in June that the agency won't bend the rules for cryptocurrency when it comes to defining what is or what isn't a security. As of Tuesday, bitcoin and ether are the only cryptocurrencies the SEC has come out and said are exempt from Securities law.\u00a0Clayton has also said that all other initial coin offerings constitute securities, and  \"if it's a security, we're regulating it.\" \"We are not going to do any violence to the traditional definition of a security that has worked for a long time,\" U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton told CNBC earlier this year. \"We've been doing this a long time, there's no need to change the definition.\"Zaslavkiy joins a growing list of alleged cryptocurrency fraudsters. He was indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice for making false and fraudulent representations for virtual currencies known as  \"REcoin\" and \"Diamond.\" Zaslavskiy allegedly tricked investors into buying digital tokens that he claimed were backed by real estate and diamonds.The judge called Zaslavskiy's reading of the relevant law  \"overly narrow,\" and said such contracts embody \"a flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.\"Other well-known cryptocurrency founders have challenged the SEC's current view on cryptocurrencies. Blockchain start-up Ripple has repeatedly said its XRP cryptocurrency is not a security. Others argue they should be viewed as  \"utility tokens\" because they often promise access to a network, platform or service instead of just profits.

Qualifications include at least 15 years of dealmaking experience for someone who can \"lead, grow and mentor a global team of experienced business development professionals.\"It's the company's sixth -- and most revealing -- job post for its new blockchain group. The five other positions are for a public policy manager, a software engineering manager in Israel, a media director and two jobs in marketing.Speculation about what Facebook will do in blockchain has been swirling since January, when CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in his 2018 mission statement that he's interested in the technology because of how it decentralizes power. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that allows virtually any type of digital transaction to be tracked without a single institution owning or controlling it.The big splash came on May 8, when Facebook Messenger leader David Marcus said he was changing jobs so he could set up a  \"small group to explore how to best leverage Blockchain across Facebook, starting from scratch.\"Five months earlier, Marcus had joined the board of Coinbase, the leading cryptocurrency exchange, but last month he stepped off the board, in part to avoid the  \"appearance of conflict,\" a Facebook spokesperson said at the time.Facebook hasn't said anything about where it's going with blockchain or even whether it's focused on digital currencies. But based on the job postings, it seems to be building an artificial intelligence platform for the project and is considering new financial services and  \"new ways to share information.\"The listing for the business development position is more illuminating because big acquisitions have been central to Facebook's expansion into new areas. Most notably, in 2014 Facebook spent $19 billion on WhatsApp, snapping up a leading messaging platform. Its next two biggest deals were for photo app Instagram ($1 billion) and virtual reality hardware developer Oculus ($2 billion).The new job post does not explicitly say that acquisitions are part of the job. Rather, it broadly says the executive will help lead  \"strategy and investments while also negotiating and closing deals.\"A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment. Marcus' team at Facebook currently includes Kevin Weil, vice president of product; James Everingham, head of engineering; Evan Cheng, director of engineering; and Morgan Beller, who works on strategy.Also, just last month, Arik Sosman, joined Facebook's blockchain group as a software engineer.

According to the agency, the company \"willfully\" violated securities laws by skirting the required registration associated with holding and trading securities.The case is the SEC's first against a fund managing digital assets and marks an extension of the agency's crackdown from cryptocurrencies to those investing in them.The agency has maintained that bitcoin and ether are not securities but that initial coin offerings, or ICOs, are securities and fall under relevant securities laws. Regulators have cracked down on fraud in initial coin offerings and repeatedly highlighted risks to retail investors.The La Jolla, California-based fund, which had $37 million in assets under management at the end of 2017, manages investment portfolios of cryptocurrency and  \"related assets\" for high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors. According to the SEC, the fund raised $3.6 million from 44 investors, primarily individuals, and solicited those investments through its website, social media accounts, and traditional media outlet interviews.Despite founding and managing other private funds focused on crypto, and one focused on Eastern Europe, 60-year-old Enneking has  \"never been registered with the Commission in any capacity,\" the SEC said.After being contacted by the regulator, Crypto Asset Management stopped its public offering and offered buybacks to investors, according to the filing. Enneking agreed to a six-figure fine and the cease-and-desist but did not admit or deny the SEC findings.Crypto Asset Management told CNBC that this was  \"old news,\" and the events in question happened late last year. Enneking also underlined that no investors were harmed and the firm cooperated fully with the agency. \"We have been fully in compliance with the SEC since shortly after they let us know they had concerns about two passages on our website,\" Enneking said.The SEC also launched a separate order against unregistered crypto broker-dealer TokenLot on Tuesday.

However, major downsides like demonetization, data privacy and fraudulent activity have shaken both consumers and content providers.Now, a growing number of companies are creating business models that use blockchain technology and cryptocurrency to address those concerns. A few companies, such as Current Media, entered the crypto space in light of recent data privacy controls, co-founder and CEO Dan Novaes told CNBC in an interview. Some of that movement has been spurred by Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, and issues like Facebook's Cambridge Analytica data scandal.Current partners with different streaming media like Apple Music and Spotify, as well as directly with content creators,\u00a0 to ensure that media makers and users are rewarded for viewing and making content. Toward that end, the company has created its own cryptocurrency unit, called a CRNC token, to reward content creators.Novaes cited YouTube as an example of a company that may want to consider it, given controversies surrounding its pay structure. \"You can only treat creators so badly,\" Novaes said, adding that billions of people turn to the platform to listen to music for free, rather than subscribe to Spotify or Apple Music.Each of Current's\u00a0Ethereum-backed CRNC Token is valued at 24 cents. The first thousand users will be live in a few months, as the company continues to roll out.\nEliminating fake news\nAdam Simmons, cofounder of Verasity, said his company developed the blockchain platform to weed out bogus news content. Verasity is a content-sharing platform fueled by VERA Tokens, which can be purchased with  and Ethereum, and it pays both viewers and creators for content.Consumers pay their favorite creator to produce material and in return, viewers get paid for investing as the channel gets more views. Viewers also get paid by advertisers to view advertisements, rather than having advertisers pay creators to attach ads to content. \"More importantly, users see what they hit, it's not a negative experience,\" Simmons said. \"It has a positive effect on the way the viewer engages.\"\u00a0Content viewers can also choose to share personal data, and how much they wish to make public.Anonymous viewer metrics are available to content creators, in order to weed out bots. Automated accounts lead to the promotion of fake news, Simmons explained. If a lot of bots  \"view\" an article, they trick the algorithm into showing the video to more real people.The company, which recently ended an initial coin offering, is expected to launch its service later this year. \nBuilding connections without the web\nRightMesh is a company that connects users peer-to-peer using blockchain in countries with restricted internet access. In that way, it bypasses the web altogether, which is useful in countries where parts of the Internet are unreachable.\u00a0 \"You are you and I am me -- that's how blockchain works,\" said CEO John Lyotier. \"When people can't access the internet, they can't gain that authority.\"\u00a0Lyotier said the idea for RightMesh came about when his team in Bangladesh was using dial-up speed internet.RightMesh works with developers in the area to work with what telecommunications are in place. The network can operate over Wi-Fi, bluetooth or personal Wi-Fi services.Using a decentralized mobile mesh networking platform, RightMesh provides people access to the internet through Androids. Users are rewarded for sharing their data with Ethereum-backed RMESH tokens. \"Blockchain is going to change the world, if you have connectivity,\" Lyotier said. \"Without blockchain technology and communication, cryptocurrency wouldn't reach its potential.\"\n", "birthday": "2018-09-08T17:47:54+0000", "date": "2018-09-08 17:47:54", "year": 2018, "month": 9, "day": 8}

But that trend is changing. Despite volatility, bitcoin's value in 30 days has risen by 0.1 percent. Ether meanwhile has fallen 45 percent in the same time period. \"In this case, bitcoin is acting like more of a safe haven for cryptocurrencies \u2014 it's kind of consolidating,\" said Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at cryptocurrency brokerage eToro.Ether's recent performance marks a sharp reverse from last year. Retail investors were excited about its utility compared to bitcoin, which can't be used to build blockchain applications and is mostly seen as a speculative investment or a store of value. The cryptocurrency rose more than 9,000 percent after starting the year around $8.Bearish comments from co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain Vitalik Buterin over the weekend may have also spooked ether investors. \"There isn't an opportunity for yet another 1,000-times growth in anything in the space anymore,\" Vitalik told Bloomberg News interview this Saturday in Hong Kong.  \"The blockchain space is getting to the point where there's a ceiling in sight.\"Ether is the name of the cryptocurrency, but it's closely associated with the popular Ethereum blockchain. Unlike bitcoin, which gives access to a global financial network, ether gives users access to a computer network. Its use has been compared to gasoline for a car. Developers can use ether tokens as fuel for certain functions on that blockchain. \"The fact that Vitalik is less bullish could be causing some to sell and it stands to reason that most of his most devout followers will be holding Ether,\" eToro's Greenspan said.Short-sellers are also putting pressure on markets. Data from market intelligence platform CoinFi shows bets against ether at an all-time high, according to CoinFi CEO Timothy Tam.Not insignificant bets, either. Tam said they're watching  \"multi-million dollar bets\" in real time. \"Retail investors were completely euphoric a few months ago. Now, that emotion has flipped and they're panicking,\" said Tam, who is also a former Goldman Sachs analyst. \"Shorts are going to ride that wave.Ethereum shorts at an all-time highSource: CoinFiAnalysts also say investor enthusiasm is eroding because of scrutiny in initial coin offerings that built on Ethereum's platform.The Securities and Exchange Commission said earlier this year that ethereum itself is not a security. But the agency's chairman has said initial coin offerings, many of which were built on the Ethereum blockchain platform, are indeed securities subject to SEC law.Tons of those projects have failed since launching during the crypto boom, and have had to sell a significant portion of ethereum holdings to manage cash flow and expenses.On Tuesday, a federal judge in New York refused to dismiss a case that argued two cryptocurrencies were not securities for the purpose of criminal law. The Brooklyn, New York district judge said a reasonable jury should be able to apply what's known as the Howey Test, which is applied to securities.While CoinFi's Tam sees regulation as a positive for the long haul, and the only way to usher in a  \"healthier market,\" investors seem to disagree. \"Others see this as cause for panic \u2014 an end to the lax rules and low hanging fruit to which they've become accustomed,\" Tam said. \"You also now have a ruling on the table that effectively means ICOs are now subject to securities law.\"Bitcoin was mostly flat Wednesday, trading near $6,269 while the rest of the cryptocurrency landscape was mixed. XRP was up .5 percent, and Stellar rose 4.8 percent. Bitcoin Cash meanwhile fell 7 percent, EOS was down 1 percent, according to CoinMarketCap.com.The entire cryptocurrency market has suffered alongside ether in 2018. The total crypto market capitalization has fallen by about 68 percent since January 1, according to CoinMarketCap.com.\n if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"vMgvE\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"vMgvE\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":470,\"200\":427,\"300\":400,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"vMgvE\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-vMgvE\"),window.datawrapper[\"vMgvE\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"vMgvE\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"vMgvE\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"vMgvE\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"vMgvE\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"});\n\n", "birthday": "2018-09-12T16:16:28+0000", "date": "2018-09-12 16:16:28", "year": 2018, "month": 9, "day": 12}

Energy, transports, labor, funding, tariffs and material costs should all usher costs higher, Wilson said.As the most bearish strategist tracked in CNBC's regular survey, Wilson has a June 2019 S&P 500 target of 2,750, implying more than 4 percent downside from current levels.The strategist has defended his call for a bear market despite the S&P 500 clinching all-time highs as recently as Aug. 29.The Dow Jones Industrial Average has not breached January's record high.Corporate profits in the second quarter rose sharply on a year-over-year basis. According to data from FactSet, S&P 500 earnings surged 25 percent in the previous quarter. \"Our call is not for a simultaneous and large repricing across risk assets, but for a bear market that rolls through different assets and sectors at different times with the weakest links being hit first/hardest,\" Wilson said.Assets like bitcoin, emerging market debt and equities, base metals and homebuilders could be particularly risky, he said. Looking at each sector, Wilson reiterated his pessimism on information technology. \"It makes sense to lower broad exposure in the near term as elevated valuations, lack of material earnings upside against expectations, extended positioning, technicals, and trade related risks all add up to a poor risk reward for the sector in the near term,\" Morgan Stanley said.Since the brokerage downgraded the industry to underweight on July 9, S&P 500 technology companies have underperformed. Tech names are up 2.9 percent since the call versus the broader market's 3.5 percent climb.\n", "birthday": "2018-09-12T17:04:55+0000", "date": "2018-09-12 17:04:55", "year": 2018, "month": 9, "day": 12}

For institutional investors that are used to having money safely stored or FDIC insured, where they would put their high-paying clients' cryptocurrency is said to be the biggest question mark. \"Institutional investors are very interested in finding a solution, but they haven't seen one that they think is perfect for various reasons,\" said Monica Summerville, senior analyst at TABB Group specializing in financial technology. \"They still self-custody, and manage all their own keys.\"Summerville works with one family office that stores clients' cryptocurrency on tiny, USB drive-looking devices in order to guard against hacks. The devices they use are about the size of a baby carrot, and fund managers organize them in binders to keep money organized until there's a better alternative.Other smaller retail investors opt to keep cryptocurrency on an exchange or have their own offline, arguably safer methods called  \"cold storage.\" But it's more complicated for family offices and hedge funds. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires private funds to use a third party, like a bank or another regulated financial institution for those holding more than $150 million in assets.In cryptocurrency, often the only thing standing between money and a hacker is what's known as a  \"private key\" or an alphanumeric code to access funds. Companies that manage these cryptographic keys are known as custodians, acting like traditional Wall Street custodians such as State Street and Bank of New York.\nThe race to custody\nCrypto company BitGo is among the companies looking to fill that gap. On Thursday, it received a state trust company charter from the South Dakota Division of Banking, making it the only regulated custody offering that's built just for storing digital assets. \"This is the missing piece for infrastructure \u2014 it's a treacherous environment today\" BitGo co-founder and CEO Mike Belshe told CNBC. \"Hedge funds need it, family offices need it, they can't participate in digital currency until they have a place to store it that's regulated.\"BitGo is opening itself up to regulatory scrutiny that isn't required for most cryptocurrency companies. The Palo Alto, California-based start-up will file financial audits, adhere to  \"know your customer\" and anti money-laundering rules, and file monthly disclosures.Belshe, who started as a software engineer at HP and Netscape, said BitGo will eventually look to become a broker-dealer, but he declined to give a timeline.\n'Plethora' of opportunity\nBitGo is not the only one plowing ahead on custody solutions. Coinbase, Gemini (run by the Winklevoss twins), Ledger and ItBit are also looking to be those trusted safeguards. Japanese bank Nomura announced plans in May to offer crypto custody. Goldman Sachs and Northern Trust are also reportedly exploring offering custodial services.Sanford C. Bernstein is among the firms arguing that reputable custody is one of the biggest headwinds to institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Solving that problem could be one way to make money in the space, according to Bernstein. \"As the crypto-asset class seasons and institutional demand builds, there are a plethora of opportunities for traditional firms to engage in the eco-system,\" Bernstein analyst Christian Bolu wrote in a note to clients in August. \"These include the provision of custodial and asset management services as well as traditional brokerage functions like market-making.\"Part of the hesitation from institutional investors is headline risk. As of the end of June, $1.6 billion in cryptocurrency had been stolen from clients, according to CoinDesk's 2018 State of Blockchain Report.Hacks have also been an issue for bitcoin prices this year. Cryptocurrencies have lost more than 60 percent of their market capitalization since the beginning of this year, according to CoinMarketCap.com. Trading volumes of cryptocurrencies have also plummeted 65 percent while the price of bitcoin has fallen 50 percent this year.Despite waning interest, Belshe is betting that BitGo will at least still have cryptocurrency to store long-term. \"This is early stages in an industry that's volatile right now,\" Belshe said. \"We're in a down cycle in terms of where we're going, but the institutions see an opportunity. It's going to progress quickly.\"\n", "birthday": "2018-09-13T13:00:08+0000", "date": "2018-09-13 13:00:08", "year": 2018, "month": 9, "day": 13}
{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/14/a-new-generation-puts-its-trust-in-tech-over-traditional-banks.html", "title": "After the crisis, a new generation puts its trust in tech over traditional banks", "content": "\nGetty Images\nFintech may be one of the few industries looking back fondly at what happened to Wall Street after 2008.The chaos and disruption of the credit crisis instilled lack of trust in existing banks and brought on new regulations and the rise of technologies that would allow scrappy Silicon Valley start-ups to reshape consumer finance.These new financial technology companies have made serious competitive inroads in areas banks have backed away from, and billions of dollars in venture capital money has followed.A key reason fintech companies have flourished, analysts say, is a lingering distrust in banks.Ten years ago the first wave of the millennial generation was settling into early adulthood just as the economy dipped into the Great Recession. Memories of foreclosed homes and savings lost in a Wall Street-fueled crisis continue to influence where they put their money. \"What that underscored for people is that banks can't be trusted, and your money is only as safe as the government allows you to believe,\" said Fundstrat founder and managing partner Tom Lee, who worked at J.P. Morgan in 2008. \"That's why millennials today have so little trust in banks, because of what their parents went through.\"More than half the world's population is under 30 right now, according to the World Economic Forum, and 10 years after the crisis, they're still wary of banks. Last year, 45.3 percent of respondents to WEF's Global Shapers Survey said they  \"disagree\" with the statement that they trust banks to be fair and honest. Only 28 percent of the more than 30,000 millennials surveyed said they agree.The skepticism isn't reserved for young people. Shareholders and regulators still want to see that the banks are in check, and questions of solvency and compliance come up consistently on bank earnings conference calls. \"Every quarter, every year for a decade banks have to earn back the trust that was lost from the financial crisis,\" said Mike Mayo, Wells Fargo's head of U.S. large-cap bank research, who worked at Deutsche Bank when Lehman Brothers went under. \"The financial crisis was terrible for the industry's reputation of trust.\"\nChallenger banks\nThe choices for where consumers can put their money look drastically different after 2008. One increasingly popular option is with a tech company. \"Neo banks,\" or digital banks that operate without any branches, aren't saddled by traditional banking technology infrastructure and are often leaner as a result.Chris Britt, the CEO of what he described as a  \"challenger bank\" called Chime, said the new sector is being boosted by fundamental distrust and young peoples' openness to tech. \"In the old days you would trust your bank because it had a great-looking edifice in front, with pillars that made you feel like your money is safe and secure,\" said Britt, a former senior product leader at Visa and SVP at the prepaid-card giant Green Dot. \"Companies like us are a direct result of what happened in 2008, which exposed and resulted in distrust among so many consumers for traditional institutions.\"\nSource: Chime\nChime offers spending and savings accounts, with a debit card, and a mobile app and doesn't charge fees. It says it's adding 150,000 new bank accounts per month. It doesn't actually hold the money on behalf of clients \u2014 its consumer deposits are held at FDIC-insured banking partner Bancorp. PayPal similarly keeps its customers' funds at a bank, a common practice for fintech companies that exempts them from most Dodd-Frank regulations.Chime and others are betting on social media as a new, cheaper way of selling these new pseudo-bank products. \"The way we build our brand and our trust is building awesome experiences for our members, then those members go talk about their experiences online and on social media on Instagram and Twitter,\" Britt said.\nMortgages\nFintech companies have made some of the biggest inroads in an area that plagued banks during and after the financial crisis: Mortgages. Regulation has banned certain high-risk practices, such as lending without verifying the borrower's ability to repay, and it has multiplied the compliance and paperwork banks need to make loans. But that has left room for non-bank companies to enter the business. \"Non-bank financial institutions that are not as tightly regulated have increased their presence over the post-crisis decade,\" said Nick Roussanov, a finance professor at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. \"In terms of origination, it's not clear that banks have been as successful as some fintech lenders.\"The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act banned risky products. Borrowers now need to document employment and debt levels while lenders need to disclose all the costs involved in each loan and verify someone's ability to repay.Data is one way to ease that added Dodd-Frank paperwork. Fintech companies like Lenda, SoFi, Lending Tree, Quicken Loans, and RocketMortgage have all entered the  \"one-click\" loan game, which would be impossible without the use of machine-learning technology.Blend, a software start-up, works with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo to handle the data side of mortgage applications by making the process as automated as possible. The company announced Thursday that former Treasury Secretary Jack Lew was joining its board.\nSource: Blend\n \"The biggest transformation has been increased regulation and scrutiny \u2014 but the way people have responded is really by investing in tech,\" Blend CEO Nima Ghamsari told CNBC. \"There's really been an increased emphasis on use of data.\"Fintech companies and banks are scrambling to adapt to finicky, impatient and tech-savvy consumers. Ghamsari said it started with the ride-hailing company Uber, which set off the  \"Uber-fication\" of everything. \"People are expecting things quickly, on one app,\" he said.\nSmall business lending\nTech companies may have an advantage when it comes to assessing credit worthiness and keeping costs low, at least in the case of Square.The digital payment company, whose stock is up a whopping 229 percent in the past year, launched Square Capital in 2014 to issue small business loans that average around $6,000. Americans typically rely on friends or family to borrow that amount instead of going to a bank.Square lends to the retailers that are already using its credit card processing or payroll services, giving it an advantage when it comes to data. The company has a machine-learning model that factors in credit card transactions, among other things, to decide whether or not to issue a loan.If a coffee shop borrows $1,000 for a cappuccino maker, for example, a fraction of every purchase at that location is automatically taken to pay back the loan. Square also gives its users projections,  \"in plain English,\" for when they might be able to pay it all back. \"Our product is almost entirely automated,\" said Jacqueline Reses, the head of Square Capital, who was a partner at private equity firm Apax during the height of the financial crisis. \"Our payment data is a core part of our modeling. Most lenders don't have that data available, and that creates incredible differentiation.\" \"If you can translate fees into something that's easy and understandable, people trust it,\" Reses said.It's not just Square moving into the small business space. PayPal, which was once a part of eBay, has a program called Working Capital that makes loans to merchants based on sales history. Amazon also does this for sellers, and began extending credit to small business owners in 2011. It uses sales data to trigger invitations for loans that could boost growth.Despite more competition, credit availability continues to be an issue for smaller merchants. Heading into this year, small businesses reported stronger revenue growth and profitability but still struggled to get loans to pay operating expenses and wages, according to the Federal Reserve's 2017 Small Business Credit Survey. As many as 70 percent of merchants didn't receive the funding they wanted last year, the report said.\nRobo advisors, online brokers and the race to zero fees\nNew robo-advisors and online brokers also are putting pressure on established financial institutions. Start-ups are competing for new accounts with lower fees. They're operating with far fewer employees, which positions them for profitability even with lower revenue.Newcomers Robinhood, Acorns, MoneyLion, Stash, Betterment and Wealthfront saw massive growth last year, with much smaller operating costs than incumbents, according to a recent JMP report. While the average balances for accounts with the start-ups are much smaller than those of Fidelity and Charles Schwab, account growth was much higher.\nThe Robinhood app on IOS and Android\u00a0Source: Robinhood\nOnline brokerage Robinhood, for example, added 3 million accounts, a 150 percent increase from last year, with fewer than 200 employees. The largest incumbent, Fidelity, added 2.5 million accounts and has more than 45,000 employees. Together, the seven start-ups that JMP examined had an average 95 percent year-over-year growth. \"The younger generation will gravitate toward brands that provide the best user experience, the best value, and ultimately, can help them reach their financial goals,\" said Devin Ryan, managing director and equity research analyst at JMP Securities.But the establishment is enjoying healthy account growth, too. Average account growth was 5 percent, with  \"sizable asset levels,\" according to Ryan.Lower, and in some cases zero, trading commissions have driven new account growth, and the traditional firms have been forced to keep up. J.P. Morgan announced a no-fee trading app in August, while Fidelity has rolled out no-fee index funds and Vanguard has launched a commission-free ETF trading platform. \"This is an important trend, where the big players have been forced to lower costs to stay relevant,\" Wharton's Roussanov said.\nSmartphones\nOne major boost to fintech came a decade ago, thanks to Steve Jobs.Since Apple's iPhone launched in 2007, the devices have become an extension of our social lives and bank accounts. Their ubiquity also gave way to these rival banking options. \"Ten years ago we didn't have these devices in our hands,\" said Sima Gandhi, head of business development and strategy at Plaid, the developer of technology that backs well-known mobile apps such as Venmo and Robinhood and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. \"Think about how familiar and comfortable we are with downloading apps and linking to our bank account \u2014 the amount of change within 10 years in terms of what customers expect is insane.\"Plaid, which has attracted an early-stage investment from Goldman Sachs, runs behind-the-scenes software that allows apps to connect to consumers' bank accounts. Gandhi, who worked at American Express for three years before Plaid, recalls debating with executives as recently as five years ago about needing a mobile app. \"Right now that wouldn't even be a question,\" said Gandhi, who is also a former policy advisor at the Treasury Department.Banks have leaned in to the mobile-first trend. Mobile banking users are forecast to double between 2015 and 2019 to 1.8 billion, more than one-quarter of the world's population, according a recent HSBC survey. \"To the extent banks want to compete for market share, they're going for online banking and shrinking brick-and-mortar, \" Wharton's Roussanov said.  \"People are just not going to the bank.\"\nBitcoin & blockchain\nA lack of trust in banks has brought rise to one of the riskiest investment products of the past decade: Cryptocurrency.Bitcoin was invented 10 years ago by an anonymous cryptographer going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. He or she (or they) was fed up with the modern financial system and set out to make an electronic version of cash that would be free from government or central bank control. \"Until 2008, everybody assumed the financial system was solid. All of a sudden that trust was lost, and that's where bitcoin came in,\" said Brian Kelly, the CEO of digital currency investment firm BKCM. Kelly was running his own global macro strategy fund when Bear Stearns faltered and was forced into an acquisition by J.P. Morgan in 2008. \"Bitcoin was a direct response to the need for a new financial system.\"The world's first and largest cryptocurrency, which was trading around 6 cents in 2010, took off in the following years and became a household name after climbing to almost $20,000 in December.Perhaps the most important part of Satoshi's vision was its underlying technology, blockchain. It's essentially a database that is distributed among many, many users. The original idea was to make sure the same digital coin wasn't used twice. A bank would normally do that in the case of dollars. But in the case of cryptocurrency, the transactions are on a public ledger and  \"verified\" by a group of people called \"miners\" who are competing to solve a math equation.Advocates have gone as far as calling it the new internet. It's being applied to everything from supply chain logistics to medical records tracking to the legal marijuana industry. In a PwC survey published in August, 84 percent of executives said their companies are  \"actively involved\" with blockchain.Tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft are jumping on the bandwagon. Even Wall Street is slowly embracing crypto. J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup have announced blockchain projects, while Goldman Sachs is offering certain bitcoin derivative options for its trading clients.Others are still cautious. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, who invested $15 billion during the financial crisis to rescue companies including Goldman Sachs and General Electric, famously called bitcoin  \"rat poison squared.\" His longtime business partner Charlie Munger likened it to \"trading turds.\"\nPrivate investment\nA steady stream of money has been fueling the fintech and crypto booms.In the case of cryptocurrency, an entirely new and legally uncertain way to raise money has popped up, called initial coin offerings. That method has brought in $12 billion this year alone, according to research from Autonomous Next, eclipsing the amount of venture capital money poured into fintech.The total deal value of venture capital money going to fintech companies in 2018 has reached $7.5 billion, according to data from Pitchbook, up from $6.9 billion last year. It's important to keep in mind that many of these companies and technologies didn't exist in 2008 \u2014 total amount of investment in the sector is about $42 billion in the past decade, according to Pitchbook.The top 10 VC-backed fintech companies all came on the scene after 2015. Personal lender Social Finance, for example, was valued at around $4.4 billion in 2017, and payments processor Stripe was valued at $9.2 billion after closing its last funding round.While fintech is certainly challenging traditional banks, there's no evidence it's going to win. Banks themselves are investing in technologies and acutely aware of the rising shift to mobile.Goldman Sachs launched its own online banking business in 2016 that targets middle-class consumers, a somewhat surprising shift from its traditional focus on big-time corporate mergers and super-wealthy individuals.Wells Fargo's Mike Mayo is optimistic that banks can survive the disruption. He suggested it might be technology people should think twice about trusting. \"The banking industry has been around for a couple hundred years and in that regard is quite trustworthy compared to a new start-up,\" Mayo said.\n", "birthday": "2018-09-14T18:23:54+0000", "date": "2018-09-14 18:23:54", "year": 2018, "month": 9, "day": 14}

In many cases, exchanges are not doing much to protect investors, according to the report. \"The industry has yet to implement serious market surveillance capacities, akin to those of traditional trading venues, to detect and punish suspicious trading activity,\" according to the report by Attorney General Barbara Underwood's office.Former Attorney General Eric Schneiderman launched an inquiry in April, looking for digital currency exchanges to answer questions about transparency and consumer protection. Ten exchanges complied with requests. Four, however, did not, including Kraken, whose CEO, Jesse Powell, tweeted in April that the AG's scrutiny was  \"tone deaf\" and \"insulting.\"The attorney general's office said that although exchanges Kraken, Binance and Gate.io do not have the required license, known as a BitLicense, they continue to provide services to New Yorkers and are therefore potentially in violation of the state's virtual currency regulations. \"In announcing the company's decision not to participate in the Initiative, Kraken declared that market manipulation 'doesn't matter to most crypto traders,' even while admitting that 'scams are rampant' in the industry,\" the report said.The three exchanges did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.The first and most famous cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was started 10 years ago by an anonymous cryptographer going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It was launched as an electronic version of cash that would be free from government or central bank control, but became a speculative bet last year as it climbed to almost $20,000.Bitcoin is now trading near $6,320, and has lost more than half of its value since January, according to data from CoinDesk.U.S. regulators have repeatedly voiced concern about crypto market manipulation and consumer protection. The Securities and Exchange Commission cited those issues as key reasons to block a bitcoin ETF, and the agency has launched numerous investigations into fraudulent initial coin offerings.In addition to manipulation, the attorney general's office dedicated sections of the report to conflicts of interest, security, and protecting consumer funds.\nLeft helpless\nThese platforms lack a  \"consistent and transparent approach\" to auditing the virtual currency in their possession, the report said. As a result, customers are often left helpless if their cryptocurrency goes missing. \"Customers are highly exposed in the event of a hack or unauthorized withdrawal,\" the report said. \"There are serious questions about the scope and sufficiency of the commercial insurance that certain platforms purport to carry to cover virtual asset losses.\"Still, the report said not all exchanges are failing customers. The platforms vary significantly in  \"comprehensiveness in responding to the risks facing the virtual markets and fulfilling their responsibilities to customers.\"Gemini, founded by internet entrepreneurs Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss, for example, partnered with the Nasdaq to use more sophisticated market surveillance tools. At least one other platform disclosed to the attorney general's office that it was  \"in the process of contracting for a similar service.\"The report posed eight questions retail investors should ask themselves before using a cryptocurrency exchange:1. What security measures are in place to stop hackers from unlawfully accessing the platform or particular customer accounts?2. What insurance or other policies are in place to make customers whole in event of a theft of virtual or fiat currency?3. What guardrails or other policies does the platform maintain to ensure fairness for retail investors in trading against professionals?4. What controls does the platform maintain to keep unauthorized or abusive traders off the venue?5. What policies are in place to prevent the company and its employees from exploiting non-public information to benefit themselves at the expense of customers?6. How does the platform notify customers of a site outage or suspension, the terms under which trading will resume, and how customers can access funds during an outage?7. What steps does the platform take to promote transparency and to subject its security, its virtual and fiat accounts, and its controls to independent auditing or verification?8. Is the platform subject to, and registered under, banking regulations or a similar regime \u2013 for instance, the New York BitLicense regulations?\nWATCH: how to start your very own cryptocurrency\nVIDEO3:1303:13How to start your very own cryptocurrencyDigital Original\n\n", "birthday": "2018-09-18T18:47:25+0000", "date": "2018-09-18 18:47:25", "year": 2018, "month": 9, "day": 18}

They could be using someone who seems to be low value to pivot toward somebody considered a higher value target, like somebody political in nature,\" he told CNBC. \"Or maybe they saw that you were discussing Bitcoin on a public message board.\"In any of these scenarios, attackers can use your social profile or email account to fish out valuable information, or break into your email account to do a password reset on your valuable financial accounts or cryptocurrency wallets.Here's some of what Risher warned us about.\nThe risks of bragging about your bitcoin\nRisher said there has been uptick in attacks against people who hold cryptocurrencies in digital wallets. These attacks can often be traced back to a post by the victim on a public message board, which is then quickly followed by criminal attempts on their email accounts.The reason is simple: Some cryptocurrency wallet providers allow users to reset their access to the wallet through email. Attackers can then use the email reset to open the wallet and steal cryptocurrency.\nScam messages have gotten personal\nIt's a mistake to associate decades-old email scams \u2014 like the once-prolific  \"Nigerian Prince\" scam \u2014 with today's criminals, he said. The newer crop of email attacks often come across as indistinguishable from personal messages you could receive from friends or family. \"You might think of this generic 'Dear Sir or Madam, I am contacting you to ask you for a favor,' but the truth is many of these attackers have done some serious research on their victims,\" he said. \"So you might get what we call 'social truth' in your message.\"Finding this  \"social truth\" \u2014 personal details about your life that make a scam message seem authentic \u2014 is getting easier as the amount of data we share grows. People tend to contribute to this growth by creating then forgetting about email addresses, message board posts and social media accounts. Information seldom disappears from the internet, even if we forget about it. \"Our data is all over the place,\" he said.\nOne degree of separation\nCriminals are also becoming much better at gaining access to  \"high-value targets,\" like executives at prominent businesses or political figures, by taking a circuitous route through people who work with them or are loosely connected to them. If you've ever volunteered for a political campaign, gone to a dinner party hosted by a CEO or worked for a well-known technology company, that person could be you.Criminals have also shown they can wend their way into anyone's email account by going through a chain of password resets through a long-forgotten account.For email threats like these, which are often more persistent and backed by nation-states, Google sends an alert to customers that government-based hackers may be trying to steal their password. Risher said it matters because people who are aware that they may be on the wrong end of a particularly effective and powerful type of attack may take additional security steps if they have that information.\n\nOther tips, Risher said, include making note of all the email addresses associated with your financial accounts and being mindful of the security associated with those addresses, and limiting the amount of information you share through social media networks.Google has been rolling out several security measures for security-minded Gmail users, including the Advanced Protection Program, which requires the use of third-party physical security keys \u2014 a solution Google has said significantly cut down on email scams internally.

It uses cryptography to record and secure financial transactions. The virtual tokens that consumers buy can themselves be used to make payments.The paper claimed that the British government currently has an ambiguous stance to the industry which is opening the door to criminal activity as well as high risk for consumers. \"As the Government and regulators decide whether the current Wild West situation is allowed to continue, or whether they are going to introduce regulation, consumers remain unprotected,\" the report said.The committee chair, Nicky Morgan MP, added that it was unsustainable for government and regulators to  \"bumble along, issuing feeble warnings to potential investors.\"\n\nThe report noted that better regulation could reduce the volatility of a crypto-asset. The price of a Bitcoin increased from $6,472 in November 2017 to $17,629 in December 2017, and then fell back to $7,208 in February 2018.The lawmakers also suggested that Britain could, as part of regulatory reforms, position itself as a global center for crypto trading.The digital currency exchange Coinbase contributed to the report as part of its work with trade body CryptoUK. In an email to CNBC on Tuesday, Coinbase UK CEO Zeeshan Feroz said the U.K. would need to introduce reforms quickly or risk losing out. \"The UK is in a race with other financial hubs around the world who are also vying to become the world's crypto capital, so it's important that this regulation is implemented as quickly as possible,\" he said.\nVIDEO3:0403:04Bitcoin's about to bounce back, according to one traderFutures Now\nRegulation surrounding cryptocurrencies is underdeveloped around the world.

In five or six years, we will have a monster weed business,\" Novogratz said on CNBC's  \"Fast Money.\"Shares of Canadian marijuana company Tilray fell sharply Friday, concluding a wild week that captivated investors. The stock closed 30.3 percent lower and has posted sharp moves all week. It was also the worst-performing stock in the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ), which fell 7 percent. Tilray shares posted a 10 percent gain on Monday, followed by surges of 29 percent and 38 percent on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.The moves followed Tilray's announcement on Tuesday that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration approved its efforts to export a cannabinoid study drug into the United States from Canada for a clinical trial.Novogratz said he couldn't help but to jump into the mix and short Tilray \u2014 a point he teased Thursday at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit. \"The Tilray move, I don't think I've ever seen a short squeeze and a frenzy like that ... the amount of volume and turnover on a low-float. And so, I was able to get a borrow, short it for a day trade, make some money,\" Novogratz said.He said he's since covered his short and is out of the sector. Novogratz said the marijuana industry has a promising future, but short-term, he said, it's all about short-selling. \"If that was my business, I would be short,\" he said.Novogratz emphasized the Tilray short was a personal trade, separate from Galaxy Digital, the crypto merchant bank he launched in November 2017, a month before bitcoin hit its all-time high near $20,000. The firm took a $134 million hit in the first quarter of this year, according to its first-ever financial disclosure released in Canada after the company went public.Novogratz is still bullish on bitcoin and cryptocurrency and predicts a rally by 2019. \"I do think bitcoin is going to be significantly higher by the end of the year,\" Novogratz said, adding he'd be disappointed if it didn't hit $6,800 or $8,800 by the end of the year.Back in November 2017, the former Fortress hedge-fund manager told CNBC that bitcoin could  \"easily\" hit $40,000 by the end of 2018.

Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, is hosting a roundtable,  \"Legislating Certainty for Cryptocurrencies,\" on Tuesday and asking industry experts to weigh in on how to police the new asset class ahead of a House bill he plans to introduce this fall. \"Your input is critical to helping us preempt a heavy-handed regulatory approach that could stall innovation and kill the U.S. ICO market,\" Davidson said in a letter to invitees.The congressman outlined a list of eight questions for the meeting, including:  \"What is the best way to protect consumers from fraud?\" The meeting will also cover private funding disclosures and token issuance laws, a spokesperson for Davidson said.Representatives from Fidelity, State Street, leading venture capital firms Union Square Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, the Nasdaq, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are among those confirmed to attend, according to an attendee list seen by CNBC. Cryptocurrency startups Ripple, Coinbase and Circle are also planning to be in the room.Reps. Ted Budd, R-N.C., Tom Emmer, R-Minn., French Hill, R-Ark., and Darren Soto, D-Fla., are set to give opening remarks during the roundtable Tuesday.The crowdfunding process known as an initial coin offering, or ICO, caught the attention of regulators after bitcoin surged to almost $20,000 last year. Other, smaller cryptocurrencies also attracted floods of retail investors, bringing a total of $12 billion in funding this year alone, according to the latest estimates from data firm Autonomous Next.U.S. financial watchdogs have been balancing consumer protection and innovation in the multibillion-dollar market. Still, crypto industry leaders have complained that laws need to be updated to accommodate the complex new digital asset class. Davidson's bill would be the first of its kind in Congress.While Congress has yet to address the fundraising craze, the Securities and Exchange Commission has cracked down this year. Chairman Jay Clayton made it clear that he will not look to update securities laws to cater to crypto. Other top SEC officials have said ether and bitcoin are not securities, but Clayton and others have said that other initial coin offerings should be treated as securities and fall under SEC jurisdiction.For now, the Securities and Exchange Commission follows the  \"Howey Test\" to determine whether or not an asset is a security. The ruling comes from a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court case that classifies a security as an investment of money in a common enterprise, in which the investor expects profits primarily from others' efforts.\nCrypto concerns\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are often described as anonymous because people don't need to give any identifying information to send or receive them. While transactions are recorded on a public ledger, they're listed under an alphanumeric code known as a  \"public key,\" which doesn't reveal the trader's identity.Legislators have been especially vocal about criminals abusing that anonymity. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., was among those with a litany of concerns at a House Financial Services subcommittee hearing in March. He and others brought up the potential for terrorist financing and for skirting  \"know your customer\" laws and money transmission standards that exist for state-backed currencies.Pat Berarducci, a lawyer for blockchain software technology company ConsenSys, said most industry participants want to achieve the same goals as regulators. He compared the fast-paced innovation and the legal uncertainty to the early dot-com years. \"There are a lot of regulators wanting the U.S. to develop 'do no harm' policies to allow innovation to grow, just like they did in the internet era,\" said Berarducci, who is attending the roundtable Tuesday.Since bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not backed by a government, founders have fewer constraints on where to start their projects. One fear is that if the U.S. cracks down too hard, founders will flock to less restrictive jurisdictions such as Switzerland or Malta. \"Businesses and entrepreneurs are making decisions about where to locate and grow based on regulatory considerations,\" Berarducci said. \"Policymakers are trying to foster innovation [and] at the same time protect consumers.\"The cryptocurrency market has struggled this year compared with 2017.

Wilking | Getty Images\nGrocery giants Walmart and Sam's Club are requiring their lettuce suppliers to get on the blockchain bandwagon.Those providing leafy green vegetables to the grocery chains will need to upload data about their foods to blockchain within a year, the companies said in letters to suppliers Monday.The companies highlighted an E. coli outbreak in romaine lettuce that recently affected more than 200 people and salmonella in products such as eggs and breakfast cereal. Using blockchain and storing the information digitally, a supplier could theoretically see which farms are infected and quickly stop the supply to restaurants and consumers. \"Walmart believes the current one-step up and one-step back model of food traceability is outdated for the 21st Century and that by, working together, we can do better,\" Walmart said in its letter. \"There is no question that there is a strong public-health and business-case for enhanced food traceability.\"Even when Walmart has been able to determine affected areas and get the foods out of grocery stores, it said, millions of heads of romaine lettuce had to be removed from the marketplace, and consumers lost confidence regardless of the region it was grown in.With blockchain, all fresh leafy greens suppliers are expected to be able to trace their products back to farms  \"in seconds \u2013 not days,\" Walmart said in a letter to suppliers. Direct suppliers will be required to conform to Walmart's standards and \"enable end-to-end traceability\" back to farms by Sept. 30, 2019, the company said.\nA real use case\nWhile companies including Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft have all announced the fact that they're doing work in blockchain, this is one of the early and very few tangible use cases announced by a major Fortune 500 company.Walmart has been piloting the technology on IBM's Food Trust blockchain for 18 months, using it to track everything from mangoes to chicken. The result is a reduction in the time it takes to track a food from a Walmart store back to the source to minutes, compared with days or sometimes weeks, Walmart said.Blockchain is the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. It records transactions on a public, distributed ledger, gets rid of the need for a third party in most cases and is touted as faster and more secure by advocates.Despite few real announcements, blockchain has been a corporate buzzword this year. According to PwC's 2018 Global Blockchain Survey, which included 600 executives from 15 territories, 84 percent of them said their companies are  \"actively involved\" with the technology.While WalMart did not say how much the blockchain move would cost farmers, IBM launched a site to walk suppliers through onboarding and aims to implement a  \"user-friendly, low-cost\" transition.WATCH: This is how blockchain can give 'invisible' people an ID\nVIDEO3:1803:18This is how blockchain can give people an IDDigital Original\n\n", "birthday": "2018-09-24T20:39:36+0000", "date": "2018-09-24 20:39:36", "year": 2018, "month": 9, "day": 24}

Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, Tuesday. Although attendees varied, none were from anti-establishment groups popular in the cryptocurrency space, nor did they include retail investors who bought bitcoin as a speculative bet.\nVIDEO4:3604:36Right now our language for cryptocurrency is 'sloppy', says Congressman Warren DavidsonSquawk Box\nInstead, experts from Fidelity, Nasdaq, State Street, Andreessen Horowitz, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filled a room in the Library of Congress. There, they politely but firmly addressed what they deemed unsolved issues as Davidson prepares to introduce a related bill this fall. \"We all want a fair and orderly markets, we want all the same things regulators do,\" said Mike Lempres, chief policy officer  at San Francisco-based Coinbase. \"It doesn't have to be done in the same way it was done in the past, and we need to be open to that.\"A recurring complaint was the idea of applying a 72-year-old securities law to digital currencies. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission uses what's known as the  \"Howey Test,\" which comes from a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court decision, to determine whether or not a cryptocurrency is a security. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has made it clear that he does not intend to update those standards to cater to crypto.Carla Carriveau, senior regulatory counsel at crypto finance firm Circle, who worked at the SEC for more than a decade, said the agency could clarify existing laws and make exemptions, but it would take moves by Congress to make a real impact. \"Congress has to act because the SEC has said what they thought was right, and already did what they thought they needed to do,\" Carriveau said.\n\nIn the meantime, the group told stories of companies scrambling to interpret whether their initial coin offerings, or ICOs, are compliant. Because some have a  \"utility\" use case, founders argued they should be exempt from securities laws, and instead be considered a commodity regulated by the CFTC. The SEC still treats all initial coin offerings, except for ethereum and bitcoin, as securities.Panelists mentioned a  \"chilling effect\" that uncertainty can have on U.S. innovation if companies are afraid of misinterpreting laws. \"If the rules are unclear, unwritten, or unknown it's not appropriate to punish people for making the wrong guess,\" said David Forman, chief legal officer at Fidelity Investments.The SEC has cracked down on those who made moves it deemed wrong. Consumer protection has been a focus for the agency and while some ICOs have been proven to be outright frauds, others have been prosecuted for less egregious violations, like not registering with the agency.\nGlobal exodus\nSince bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not backed by a government, founders have fewer constraints on where to start their projects. One fear that at least half of attendees mentioned is that if the U.S. cracks down too hard, or fails to give clarity, founders will flock to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions overseas. \"The competition around the world is real. But there is still time and opportunity for the U.S. to be a leader here,\" said Joyce Lai, a lawyer at blockchain software technology company Consensys, which she said now employs more than 1,000 people globally.Cryptocurrencies have already raised a record $12 billion so far this year, according to data firm Autonomous Next. Jesse Powell, co-founder and CEO of crypto exchange Kraken, highlighted the advantage of being able to freely raise capital. \"Foreign companies are able to outraise their U.S. competitors and often whoever raises the most money is who wins,\" Powell said. \"Not only are U.S. companies not able to raise enough to compete globally, U.S. investors are not able to invest in these global companies.\"\nReaching across the aisle\nDespite four hours of discussions, a cryptocurrency bill from Congress is  \"not a cooked thing,\" Davidson said. Tuesday's panel was mostly for listening to the industry about what to include before it's drafted and introduced, the congressman said. Still, he said moving quickly was \"imperative.\" \"Legitimate players in the industry have a desire for some sort of certainty so we can prevent and prosecute fraud,\" Davidson said. \"I'm confident we can move forward and make this a flourishing market in the U.S. It's an imperative for us to do, we did it well with the internet.\"A few panelists were emboldened by the possibility of the bipartisan effort behind crypto. Reps. Ted Budd, R-N.C., Tom Emmer, R-Minn., and Darren Soto, D-Fla were among the Congressional representatives attending the hearing. \"We need to get moving on this now, there's no time for delay,\" said Emmer, who has introduced multiple blockchain bills to Congress. Blockchain is the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies, and is being applied to everything from storing health care records, to tracking vegetables that carry E. coli.Soto agreed with his Republican colleagues, but went even further, suggesting that Congress may need to throw out the current playbook for cryptocurrency. \"I'm sensing we may need an entirely new category that treats this like a new asset, so that we're not trying to squeeze a square peg into a round hole,\" Soto said. \"There needs to be some streamlining based on the definitions of digital assets.\"\n", "birthday": "2018-09-26T02:36:24+0000", "date": "2018-09-26 02:36:24", "year": 2018, "month": 9, "day": 26}

You have software developers and entrepreneurs around the world building products on top of crypto, and it's unlocking a lot of use cases, particularly in emerging markets. I think we need to shift as a company to a more global perspective,\" Dan Romero, vice president and general manager of Coinbase Consumer, said Tuesday on CNBC's  \"Fast Money.\"Beginning Tuesday, creators can go to listing.coinbase.com to submit an application to list their digital asset on Coinbase. Previously, Coinbase had to make the first move, and therefore bore the responsibility of identifying, selecting and vetting new assets for the platform. And Coinbase will no longer be restricting listed assets to those that comply with U.S. regulation. From now on, added assets will be regional and based on a specific region's regulatory framework.The changes will allow for hundreds, if not thousands, of digital assets to be added to the platform. For some perspective, the platform supports five currencies right now: bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, litecoin and ethereum classic. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies Coinbase doesn't support, Romero said. \"It's responding to what customers want. Adding more assets is directly something customers are telling us. So, ultimately, by adding more assets, we are going to increase trust and make the platform easy to user for customers,\" Romero said.But it isn't all about the customers, it's about the competition, too.Improving the number of assets listed will increase Coinbase's trading volume and make it more competitive with foreign exchanges that offer more options for traders. \"There are some really high-quality, global exchanges that you're going to see in the coming months, as we add more assets, we are going to be more competitive with,\" he said.And when you add more assets,  \"ultimately volumes are going to take care of themselves,\" Romero added.Together, these changes open up the Coinbase ecosystem to an exponentially broader pool of blockchain-based projects around the world, in a move Coinbase hopes will expedite its mission of creating an open financial system for the world.Coinbase has served more than 20 million customers and supported more than $220 billion in cryptocurrency trades since it was founded in 2012.

The agency did clarify that bitcoin and ether are commodities, regulated by the CFTC. But for thousands of others created through initial coin offerings, the agency uses a yardstick known as the  \"Howey Test.\" The rule comes from a 1946 U.S. Supreme Court decision.Chairman Clayton has made it clear that he does not intend to update those standards for crypto. As an independent agency, the SEC can give clarity on existing laws but cannot change them without an act of Congress. This letter leaves the door open to that.Last week, Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said he plans to introduced three crypto and blockchain friendly bills, while Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, is drafting one to be introduced this fall that he says not yet  \"fully cooked.\"Friday's letter echoed a chief concern from crypto industry stakeholders: Lack of clarity could cause innovation to flee overseas. \"Current uncertainty surrounding the treatment of offers and sales of digital tokens is hindering innovation in the United States and will ultimately drive business elsewhere,\" the letter said. \"We believe that the SEC could do more to clarify its position.\"The letter comes on the back of a four-hour meeting on Capitol Hill this week, attended by representatives from Wall Street, venture capital, and cryptocurrency firms. Among the roughly 50 participants present were Fidelity, Nasdaq, State Street, Andreessen Horowitz, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \"We all want fair and orderly markets, we want all the same things regulators do,\" said Mike Lempres, chief policy officer at San Francisco-based Coinbase said during the meeting. \"It doesn't have to be done in the same way it was done in the past, and we need to be open to that.\"In the letter, lawmakers admonished the idea of using punishment as way to tell the industry where they stand. \"We are concerned about the use of enforcement actions alone to clarify policy and believe that formal guidance may be an appropriate approach to clearing up legal uncertainties which are causing the environment for the development of innovative technologies in the United States to be unnecessarily fraught, \" the letter said.The agency has cracked down on frauds in initial coin offerings, or ICOs, since bitcoin's epic rise to almost $20,000 at the end of last year. ICO fundraising has brought in $12 billion this year alone, according to data from Autonomous Next. Consumer protection has been a focus for the agency and while some ICOs have been proven to be outright frauds, others have been prosecuted for less egregious violations, like not registering with the SEC.The letter was an effort from both sides of the aisle, and was lead by Rep. Ted Budd, R-N.C., Reps. Emmer and Davidson, as well Darren Soto, D-Fla. In addition, David Schweikert, R-Ariz., Jeff Duncan, R- S.C., Alex Mooney, R- W.V., John Curtis, R-Utah, Ralph Norman, R- S.C., Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., Mark Meadows, R-N.C., Derek Kilmer, D-Wash., Greg Gianforte, R-Mont., and Sean Duffy, R-WI, were among the signatories.The group did not give a deadline for a SEC response but urged the agency to  \"be mindful of the speed at which the industry is developing.\"Here are some requests from Congress:1. The SEC should clarify the criteria used to determine when offers and sales of digital tokens should properly be considered  \"investment contracts\" and therefore offerings of securities.The public statements made by yourself, Commissioner Peirce, and Director Hinman are helpful indicia of the evolution of the SEC's views of digital token platforms. Please expand on what criteria the SEC is currently using - specific to digital tokens- to determine under what circumstances the offer and sale of a digital token should properly be considered an  \"investment contract,\" and therefore, and offer or sale of \"securities\" under the Securities Acts and the Howey Test.The various criteria set out at the end of Director Hinman's speech are helpful; nevertheless, specific FAQ-type examples illustrating how these factors may be applied in practice could aid market participants in better understanding how these factors should be applied.The marketplace for digital tokens is expanding. Other digital tokens in existence today should also be deemed to fall outside the parameters used to define an investment contract under the securities laws. In the current environment it is unclear which other unique characteristics of digital tokens are also considered by the SEC when making this determination.2. Do you agree that a token originally sold in an investment contract can, nonetheless, be a non-security as Mr. Hinman stated? Can the resultant token be analyzed separately from the original purchase agreement, which may clearly be an investment contract? And, if so, could the resultant token, nonetheless be a non-security?3. Please describe the tools available to the SEC to offer more concrete guidance to innovators on these topics.WATCH: Here's why a BitcoinIRA is enticing some to risk their savings\u00a0\nVIDEO4:0504:05Here's why a BitcoinIRA is enticing some to risk their savingsDigital Original\n\n", "birthday": "2018-09-28T16:24:37+0000", "date": "2018-09-28 16:24:37", "year": 2018, "month": 9, "day": 28}

And while those losses can be used to offset any other investment gains, it could raise eyebrows at the IRS if it's the first time the agency is hearing about your crypto holdings. \"If I were in those shoes, I'd think about my past transactions and whether there were gains,\" said Sarah-Jane Morin, a partner in the San Francisco office of national law firm Morgan Lewis & Bockius. \"If I had gains, and I was not willing to go back and amend my return, I might not do anything that would trigger a loss,\" she said. \"But you should just be reporting it correctly so you're not playing audit lottery.\"\n\nThe IRS has made it clear over the last few years that bitcoin and the other 1,500-plus digital assets are on its radar. Earlier this year, the agency released a notice to remind taxpayers that crypto transactions come with tax implications.Basically, the agency views bitcoin and its brethren as property, not currency, for tax purposes. This means that whether you sell it for cash, trade it for another cryptocurrency or use at a merchant that accepts it as payment, the difference between what you initially bought it for \u2014 your cost basis \u2014 and its value upon sale is either a gain or a loss.\nVIDEO2:0002:00If you own bitcoin, here's how much you owe in taxesAdvisor Insight\nA gain realized from bitcoin owned for less than a year is taxed at as ordinary income. Gains from bitcoin held longer is taxed as long-term gains. Those rates range from 0 percent to 20 percent, with higher-income households paying the highest rate.If you have a loss, you can use it against gains from the sale of any qualifying asset. And if you have more in losses than gains, you can use up to $3,000 to offset ordinary income in that year and carry over the rest of the loss to future years.\n\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Your Wealth \n Weekly advice on managing your money\n SIGN UP NOW\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and services.

During that time, the price of one coin rose to $430, from about $13.Last year, bitcoin investors would have been more likely to have gains than losses. The coin rose during 2017 to reach a trading high of more than $19,300 in late December after opening the year below $1,000.Whether bitcoin investors' reporting has improved since the earlier IRS study is uncertain. CNBC requested 2017 data from the agency but did not hear back by publication time.Meanwhile, since its 2014 guidance on the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies, the IRS has not issued further input. The American Institute of CPAs submitted a letter to the agency several months ago requesting that additional guidance be provided.While the IRS has made it clear that noncompliance can lead to a rash of bad consequences \u2014 ranging from penalties and interest to prison time \u2014 some investors simply haven't understood the reporting requirements, Morin said.\nVIDEO4:3604:36Right now our language for cryptocurrency is 'sloppy', says Congressman Warren DavidsonSquawk Box\n \"A lot of people treat bitcoin as cash, or the same as [mobile payment service] Apple Pay,\" Morin said. \"If they exchange it for another cryptocurrency or use it at, say, Overstock.com, they'd have to compare the fair market value of it that day versus their cost basis. They're not always tracking that kind of information.\"She said that when those bitcoin holders go to do their tax returns, they have no idea what their gain or loss was, so they either don't report it or they try to cobble together information that may or may not be 100 percent accurate. \"In my view, the IRS would rather see some compliance made with your best effort instead of just throwing up your hands and saying it's too hard,\" Morin said.More from FA Playbook:What to watch out for if you want to jump on the cannabis investing bandwagonFreezing your credit is now freeGetting a divorce?

And the IRS has put the crypto world on notice: Earlier this year, the popular trading platform Coinbase alerted 13,000 customers that it was complying with a court order to provide the IRS with information on accounts worth at least $20,000 during 2013 to 2015. \"I think now is the time to try to get ahead of these issues, although it's going to be challenging for a lot of folks to go back and figure out what their cost basis was,\" Morin said.WATCH: How to start your very own cryptocurrency\nVIDEO3:1303:13How to start your very own cryptocurrencyDigital Original\n \n", "birthday": "2018-09-26T13:02:31+0000", "date": "2018-09-26 13:02:31", "year": 2018, "month": 9, "day": 26}

Blue | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n \"What are you doing here?\" a young engineering student asked Vipin Mayar, the head of artificial intelligence initiatives at Fidelity Investments, at a MIT conference in San Francisco.As Mayar recalled,  \"They were all just\u2026 surprised.\"Fidelity executives are getting used to the confused looks and double-takes their company booth draws at Silicon Valley job fairs.Although the 72-year-old, family-controlled firm is known for managing retirement plans and mutual funds, by many measures, Fidelity is a tech company. The firm is spending billions of dollars to compete in new technologies like blockchain, artificial intelligence and virtual reality. According to executives, Fidelity wants to measure itself against tech firms like Nvidia, not its more traditional Wall Street rivals like Charles Schwab.Fidelity was doing fintech before fintech was cool, as CEO Abigail Johnson explained it during a panel presentation at the company's headquarters this month. Her grandfather, Edward C. Johnson, founded the company in 1946 and is still quoted as saying it's better to  \"take intelligent risks rather than follow the crowd.\"Fidelity has notched a few industry firsts that could probably fall under Johnson's  \"intelligent risk\" category.In the 1960s, the firm bought its first mainframe computer, which took up the entire floor of an office building. In the 1970s, Fidelity was the first to sell retail mutual funds directly through a toll-free telephone line and had the first voice-activated computer response system for stock prices and yield quotes. In the 1980s, it rolled out Fidelity Money Line, the first nationwide electronic funds transfer for money market funds, and a voice-activated computer answering system.\nSource: Fidelity Investments\nFidelity Labs &  \"FCAT\"\nJohnson's father, Edward Johnson III or  \"Ned,\" was CEO before her and in the 1990s decided there should be a group tasked with researching cutting-edge technology. \"That's how FCAT got going,\" Johnson said on stage at the company's Boston headquarters last Friday. \"We've had that tradition for a long time.\"So, along came Fidelity Center for Applied Technology, or FCAT, as employees call it. The group embraced what would prove to be a really intelligent risk: The internet. It was the first mutual fund company to have an online home page, and it had the country's first 401(k) plan sold and serviced online, a spokesperson for the company said.Fidelity spends $2.5 billion on technology annually, including FCAT, another innovation center that came along 10 years later called Fidelity Labs and enterprise services. The innovation centers have become a place where employees can take risks, including the creation of a mobile app, a chatbot named Cora and the secretive blockchain efforts.The firm certainly has the money to back a certain amount of risk-taking. Operating profits for FMR LLC, the parent company of Fidelity Investments, rose 54 percent last year, according to its most recent annual report. In 2017, revenues topped $18.2 billion, a 13.7 percent increase year over year. The firm closed the year with a record $6.8 trillion in investor assets under administration, up 19 percent from the year earlier. That total has since increased to more than $7 trillion.Not every risk pans out, such as the failed financial app it developed for Google Glass and the Pebble smartwatch.\nFidelity techSource: Fidelity Investments\nFailure is acceptable but they had to create a separate place to do it, far away from the retirement and other fund businesses. \"If you're running Fidelity.com, no one wants to hear 'we failed today,' or call a call center and hear 'oh sorry, they're out innovating,'\" said Sean Belka, the head of Fidelity Labs. \"We had to create a safe space, essentially for failure. That's what the labs is.\"Johnson pointed out that financial services don't have a high  \"fun factor,\" which makes it hard for the average person to care about it. That's not obvious during a visit to the lab, where virtual reality headsets are strewn on tables and a corn-hole game sits in the corner. Groups of employees are intensely huddled in glass offices around white boards, with rainbow-colored post-its and inspirational quotes on the walls, as they try to develop technology to solve some of the world's less glamorous problems, like student debt.They live by the  \"fail fast and fail early\" mantra made popular in Silicon Valley. Executives say by failing early, they can move on without wasting time and money on projects that end up as duds. If the projects do seem promising, Fidelity runs test programs on their own associates before sending them out to customers.Its student debt offering, which Hewlett Packard Enterprises will now offer to its own employees, came out of Fidelity Labs. It helps employees refinance debt, and can pull loans from multiple different vendors in real-time. The idea came from a realization that millennials care more about short-term needs than their retirement funds. Fidelity Labs was also the birthplace of something called bSolo, that helps gig economy workers pay quarterly taxes.\nArtificial Intelligence\nThe modern consumer is finicky with abundant, and often, cheaper options. Financial companies are turning to artificial intelligence to create a better experience. \"For them the experience they want is the last best experience they had that morning \u2014 not the last best experience in financial services,\" said Ram Subramaniam, head of brokerage and investment solutions for personal investing. \"After somebody gets out of an Uber and had a fabulous experience, when they come to a financial company, the expectation is set.\"Fidelity uses machine learning to improve the customer experience by trying to predict what they want without them even knowing. It can authenticate the identity of a customer calling, and figure out why they're calling, within a fraction of a second. The chatbot, Cora, also comes out of artificial intelligence, and Fidelity Brokerage's robo advisor uses some of the same proprietary tech.\nFidelity virtual realitySource: Fidelity Investments\nMachines won't replace advisors, though. Despite the billions of dollars spent on tech, Johnson said their  \"core belief\" is that financial services industry is not going to go 100 percent electronic.Modern customers want convenience on an app but they still want to pick up the phone, or at least know they have someone they can contact other than a chatbot for financial planning. The company is using virtual reality for employee training. It created an in-house program that aims to teach employees how to handle situations with empathy and compassion. Associates walk through simulations, like entering the home of a grieving client, using a virtual headset.\nCompeting for talent\nFidelity employs 12,000 technologists, almost one-third of its workforce, but finding qualified workers can be especially tricky. According to one recruiter, 93 percent of all software engineers have jobs in what's very much  \"a candidate's market\" heavily tilted to the Silicon Valley culture. \"A company like Fidelity has a traditional brand \u2014 they need to look different to attract a tech candidate. My question would be how are they going to do this?\" said Melissa James, founder and CEO of recruitment platform Tech Connection and former recruiter for Google. She pointed out that candidates might be concerned about things as seemingly subtle as dress code. \"That's what I think when I think of Fidelity. At Google, you can wear jeans and a t-shirt.\"The  \"7th Floor Village\" at the company's headquarters was designed to counter the staid reputation financial firms tend to have, transporting visitors from Boston's Seaport to Silicon Valley. The floor was redesigned a year ago to jibe with the working environment software engineers expect: open plan with no offices or assigned desks. People work at broad communal tables or standing desks, and bright colored couches are scattered about. Nearby, there is cold brew coffee on tap.\nFidelity headquarters\u00a0Source: Fidelity Investments\nIn over 72 years in business, Fidelity has collected an enormous amount of data, a fact it uses to lure talent from Amazon and Microsoft. \"Our projects are harder, more exciting and more interesting than a lot of the digital companies,\" Mayar, the head of AI, said. \"We've got more data, and broader data, which drives better AI.\"\nPricing pressure\nExecutives acknowledge that a race to lower fees in the financial industry is here to stay.Fidelity is moving to zero fees in some areas. Just a month after announcing it would become the first financial company to offer no-fee index mutual funds, Fidelity attracted roughly $1 billion into the two portfolios. It offers access to more than 260 other commission-free ETFs. On stock trading, the firm is betting that the quality of its brokerage services will resonate with customers more than the appeal of zero fees. \"Value is more than just price,\" Subramaniam said.Fidelity is betting that some of these offerings that come with being one of Fidelity's 27 million customers are enough to keep millennials from jumping to zero-fee start-ups, like the mobile trading app Robinhood.One advantage it has in this pricing war is its size. It's able to absorb some of the pressure because it has a  \"broad suite\" of ways make money off its customer relationships, according to Devin Ryan, managing director and analyst at JMP Securities. \"Scale players like Fidelity are in a strong position because they have the capability to invest tens of millions, or billions, in tech,\" Ryan said. \"They're doing that partially because of the revenue backdrop. When times are good you invest \u2014 and times are good right now.\"\nBlockchain and bitcoin\nFidelity recognized the potential in blockchain before it became the corporate buzzword of 2018. CEO Abby Johnson led the charge into cryptocurrency, one of the riskiest and most volatile asset classes of the past year. \"A few plus years ago, myself and a few other senior executives here were just curious about what was going on, particularly with bitcoin, \" Johnson said. \"We started getting together to say 'we're got to understand this.'\"The curiosity led them to start bitcoin  \"mining,\" at a location in New Hampshire when the crypto's price was around $180.Flash forward to December of last year when bitcoin rose to almost $20,000,  \"behold \u2014 the price goes up and all the sudden we're making money, which was never the intent,\" Johnson said. She did not specify how much bitcoin has been mined, or how much money Fidelity made.There's clear interest in the topic by Fidelity employees. Its blockchain club for employees called  \"bits and blocks,\" hosts seminars, office hours and meet ups, now has roughly 2,600 members.The company has an arrangement with Coinbase that allows Fidelity customers to check their cryptocurrency balances on the Fidelity mobile app. In 2015, it started facilitating charitable donations in bitcoin.Many other potential uses for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have been scrapped by now or  \"put on the shelf,\" Johnson said. \"We're trying to listen to the marketplace.\"In the meantime, Katie Chase, the head of strategy for Fidelity Center for Applied Technology and head of the Blockchain Incubator (which is a part of FCAT), is exploring uses for both public blockchain and enterprise blockchain. Chase could not comment specifically on the projects but said she's seen massive interest from clients and partners, as well as their own employees. \"It's still very nascent. All of the stuff that you're reading about, if you dig under the covers is still in the proof of concept stage,\" Chase said. \"We tried to apply blockchain to some use cases where we learned a lot but the technology isn't mature enough to solve these problems.\"For now, the group is more focused on what some of those barriers are, she said. They're looking at how to  \"tokenize\" physical items, like a piece of art for example, or how to use blockchain in the supply chain space. \"Those are on the shelf, but we think they'll eventually come off,\" Chase said.Fidelity will be well-equipped when they do. She used the example of Pebble watch, a failure by retail standards but something that paid off for Fidelity. Her group had created an app for the smartwatch, which shut down three years after raising millions through a crowdfunded kickstarter campaign.When the Apple Watch finally came to market, Fidelity was ready. It used the app developed for Pebble to quickly go live on Apple's new product. \"We were not betting that the Pebble watch is the next big thing \u2014 but in case we have people wearing these things on their wrist, we wanted to be there too,\" she said. \"It gave us the learning for when the smart watch did go to mass market, and we were able to be there.\"\nPrivate company\nThis would all be much harder to do if Fidelity had to answer to shareholders. If its long-term side projects fail, or bitcoin goes to zero, it doesn't have to answer questions about it posed by analysts during quarterly conference calls. And most importantly, executives say, its retirement and mutual funds won't be affected.The separate tech incubators have allowed the company to take risks, even when markets aren't in a historic bull run. Sean Belka of Fidelity Labs has worked at public companies he says are  \"quicker to change directions during different cycles.\" \"There's a staying power around being able to invest for the long term. It gives us the opportunity to invest over all economic cycles,\" Belka said. \"If you look at FCAT, it's survived not just the 2008 crisis but the dot com crisis.\"Although most of its brokerage peers are also spending big on technology, Fidelity has managed to fly under the radar, according to one analyst who covers its competitors. Richard Repetto, principal at Sandler O'Neill & Partners pointed out there's less scrutiny on Fidelity's spending, investments and returns and, compared to a public company, it doesn't really have to share what it's working on. \"Fidelity is a sleeping giant,\" Repetto said. \"Or at least they're not a well known giant as far as what they're actually doing.\"\n", "birthday": "2018-09-29T13:00:53+0000", "date": "2018-09-29 13:00:53", "year": 2018, "month": 9, "day": 29}

So-called miners on the network work out complex mathematical problems to validate transactions.There needs to be consensus on the network about the validity of the transaction in order for it to go through. While this system reduces the risk of malicious activity being carried out on the network, it can also increase the time it takes for transactions to settle.However, Deloitte has said work is being done to create a more efficient model that can speed up transaction speeds. Firms in the industry like Hyperledger, Stellar and Ripple are using new consensus mechanisms aimed at accelerating this process.These new models are called  \"proof-of-stake\" systems, where a cryptocurrency miner is required to have a certain stake in the digital asset in order to participate in the network. \"The evolution of consensus mechanisms is improving blockchain speed significantly \u2014 good news for applications in trade finance, supply chain traceability, auto leasing, marine insurance, health care, and insurance,\" the report said.\nInteroperability\nDigital cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethernum, Dash, Monero and Litecoin.Chesnot | Getty Images\nWith an increasing number of players in an ever-expanding industry like blockchain, some worry that with so many different networks, no standard exists to allow them to interact with each other.This standardization is what the industry calls interoperability. According to Deloitte, the lack of interoperability  \"grants blockchain coders and developers freedom \u2014 and can give IT departments headaches as they discover that platforms can't communicate without translation help.\"The report said that, on coding site GitHub, there was more than 6,500 active blockchain projects using a range of platforms with different coding languages, protocols, consensus mechanisms and privacy measures. \"Standardization could help enterprises collaborate on application development, validate proofs of concept, and share blockchain solutions as well as making it easier to integrate with existing systems,\" the Deloitte study said. \"Help is on the way as a growing number of industry participants work to enable cross-blockchain transactions, interconnectivity, and standardization.\"Organizations that include hundreds of members focused on creating a standard version of blockchain and encouraging collaboration are lifting hopes of the industry overcoming the interoperability problem.Interledger for instance is a computer protocol designed to enable payments between different distributed ledger networks. \"The efforts we are seeing represent a vector of progress for blockchain technology,\" the Deloitte report said.\nReduced complexity, cost\nWith venture funding aplenty, numerous blockchain applications have been developed and many more are in the works. Here, a computer programmer sets up a mining rig to mine for bitcoin.eclipse_images | Getty Images\nOne of the frequently noted criticisms of bitcoin's blockchain network is the fact that it relies on intensive computing power \u2014 and hence a lot of electricity \u2014 in order to run.Miners use huge computer rigs with multiple servers to keep the network ticking over, and that process certainly doesn't come cheap.A study released by Elite Fixtures earlier this year said that it cost more than $26,000 to mine just one bitcoin in South Korea, which is one of the world's largest markets for cryptocurrency trading.Although bitcoin miners get paid a sum of bitcoin for their labors, the price tag of validating transactions in the first place could be a problem for the widespread penetration of that technology in commercial activity.As well as cost issues involved in both creating and maintaining a blockchain network, the Deloitte report says that complexity is another cause for concern.But a number of firms, including Amazon, IBM and Microsoft, are working on ways of improving the cost and complexity involved in creating blockchain networks by using cloud technology. Their work in the field is focused on creating what is known as blockchain-as-a-service, where effective  \"templates\" are offered in order to make it easier for developers to set up and run blockchain networks. \"New cloud offerings have been coming to market at an accelerating pace and have the potential to lower the barriers to developing and operating blockchain networks,\" the study said. \"Cloud providers are releasing blockchain templates intended to automate the setup of basic blockchain infrastructure; vendors claim this can reduce application development from months to days.\"The report also notes that Hyperledger's open-source platform Sawtooth lets developers build blockchain applications in their preferred coding language, without requiring knowledge of the core system. \"There is a clear trend toward easier-to-use blockchain tools and platforms,\" Deloitte said. \"This vector of progress is likely to foster greater adoption of blockchain technology over time.\"\nSupportive regulation\nSteven Mnuchin, U.S. Treasury secretaryPatrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nAs cryptocurrency prices spiked last year, regulators became increasingly uneasy about the speculative nature of the market.A controversial phenomenon known as an initial coin offering (ICO) for instance was banned in South Korea and China, and the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year charged the founders of Floyd Mayweather-backed cryptocurrency firm Centra with carrying out a fraudulent ICO. In an ICO, blockchain ventures sell new digital tokens in exchange for other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, or cash.But there are other areas in blockchain where regulation is uncertain, such as smart contracts \u2014 self-executing contracts that run on blockchain networks like Ethereum. Such contracts contain a set of conditions under which a buyer and a seller are in agreement. When those conditions are met, the contract is automatically enforced, something which proponents say is more proficient than paper-based contracts. But Deloitte highlights that existing regulations don't cover smart contracts, which could inhibit  investment in blockchain.However, Deloitte points out that some progress is being made on the regulatory front, with 17 U.S. state legislatures either mulling or passing bills related to blockchain adoption.And Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at the start of the year that a working group has been formed to look into cryptocurrencies. \"There is a lot of work still to do before the major regulatory hurdles to blockchain adoption are cleared,\" says the Deloitte report. \"But momentum is building.\"\nMore collaboration\nGetty Images North America\nAnd last but not least, the report by Deloitte says that more firms working in the sector need to collaborate in order for the technology to promote both the development of applications and education.A number of groups have been formed aimed at increasing collaboration in the space and encouraging standardization \u2014 something that could help the aforementioned problem of lacking interoperability between networks. \"As a technology that facilitates transactions across a network, the value of a blockchain network increases with the number of users,\" the Deloitte report said. \"That's one reason why the growth of blockchain consortia is a bullish sign.\"Such groups, which contain hundreds of member firms, include R3, the RiskBlock Alliance, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and Hyperledger.In March, a study by tech-focused research group Gartner put the number of blockchain-oriented consortia currently in existence at 61, more than doubling the 28 consortia that were around in the previous year. However, there are reports that some of these working groups, such as R3's and Hyperledger's, could be running out of money. \"Not all consortia are building applications, and not all are equally effective,\" the report said. \"But growing participation by enterprises, technology providers, regulators, and governments is a vector of progress in the development of blockchain that will help increase adoption of the technology.\"\n", "birthday": "2018-10-01T12:57:42+0000", "date": "2018-10-01 12:57:42", "year": 2018, "month": 10, "day": 1}

Revenue was up tenfold in the same period, to $2.8 billion as of the end of June, and adjusted return on equity was 58.8 percent. \"Clearly by the numbers, they're quite profitable,\" said Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM. Kelly said profitability was a concern for crypto market participants. If Bitmain wasn't making money, some speculated that it would have to sell its holdings to fund operations and that would put pressure on already weak crypto prices.Although the exact amount isn't disclosed in the papers, Bitmain has publicly bet on Bitcoin Cash. That cryptocurrency rallied 20 percent after the documents were made public, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. \"They won't have to sell any of their crypto holdings, that's really positive for cryptocurrencies,\" Kelly said.Still, this year's crypto bear market is not good news for the company. Bitmain had $886.9 million in cryptocurrency as of the end of June, which makes up 28 percent of its total assets. Though bitcoin briefly rallied above $8,000, it is now trading near $6,500, right around where it was in June.Bitmain also holds bitcoin. That cryptocurrency is down more than 53 percent this year, while the total market capitalization for cryptpocurrencies has dropped by $400 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com.Cryptocurrency purists who applaud bitcoin's  \"decentralized\" nature have chafed at Bitmain's power over the market. Despite growing competition, the company still controlled 85 percent of the market for mining chips last year according to Sanford C. Bernstein analysts.The disclosure also unveiled a group of more than 40 investors. While the majority were Chinese firms the list included subsidiaries of Sequoia Capital, CAS Investment Management and Philippe Laffont's tech-focused Coatue Management.Despite the downturn in prices, Bitmain's customer base roughly doubled from 2017 to the end of June. The user base was at roughly 6,000 three years ago, and jumped to more than 46,000 in 2017. The firm had more than 80,000 customers as of the end of June, according to the documents.Bitmains' chips and hardware products support artificial intelligence, the disclosure said, which could be seen as a hedge to any crypto crackdowns in China. The Chinese government has signaled it could crack down on mining, has already restricted cryptocurrency trading and banned initial coin offerings. \"We see a promising future for the application of ASIC chips in AI and will continue focusing on the AI chip market,\" the documents said.WATCH: How to start your very own cryptocurrency\nVIDEO3:1303:13How to start your very own cryptocurrencyDigital Original\n\n", "birthday": "2018-09-26T21:14:36+0000", "date": "2018-09-26 21:14:36", "year": 2018, "month": 9, "day": 26}

It's more broadly about blockchain, which some pundits have called as transformative as the internet, instead of just cryptocurrency, which Warren Buffett famously called rat poison.In the newest fund, which has 140 investors so far and a 10-year investment period, buyers get equity in a blockchain company instead of just investing in a  \"coin.\"Initial coin offerings, or ICOs, often promise investors a piece of that company down the road or access to a product that might not even exist yet.\nVIDEO6:5306:53Does bitcoin need an ETF to make a comeback? Crypto hedge fund manager weighs inFast Money\n \"We're seeing a shift in momentum,\" said Paul Veradittakit, a partner at Pantera. \"We're seeing a lot more interesting VC deals, and more equity deals this year than ICO deals.\"ICOs have gotten too controversial for some investors. While some projects are completely legitimate, others have been exposed as running frauds and caught the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency has shut down multiple projects, and tech giants Google, Facebook, and Twitter banned ICO advertising on their platforms in March.Veradittakit said the firm is seeing interest from some first-time investors who see the crypto slump as a buying opportunity. In the most recent investor letter, Pantera said its bitcoin fund's lifetime gain was more than 10,000 percent, net of fees and expenses.The third fund's total eclipses the size of earlier funds by Pantera Capital, a Menlo Park, California, firm founded by former Goldman trader Dan Morehead. Its second fund reached $25 million, while the first fund was $13 million, which closed in 2013.The new fund's first investment was in a project called Bakkt that began in early August and is backed by Starbucks, Intercontinental Exchange, Microsoft, BCG and others. Bakkt said it aims to let consumers and institutions buy, sell, store and spend cryptocurrencies on a global network by this fall.\n", "birthday": "2018-08-16T21:04:34+0000", "date": "2018-08-16 21:04:34", "year": 2018, "month": 8, "day": 16}

Terpin was the victim of two hacks within seven months.After the first hack, Terpin alleged that an impostor was able to get his phone number from an  \"insider cooperating with the hacker\" without an AT&T store employee requiring him to show valid identification or provide a required password. That phone number was later used to access Terpin's cryptocurrency accounts, according to the complaint. \"What AT&T did was like a hotel giving a thief with a fake ID a room key and a key to the room safe to steal jewelry in the safe from the rightful owner,\" the complaint alleged.In an emailed statement, AT&T said  \"we dispute these allegations and look forward to presenting our case in court.\"\nVIDEO3:1303:13How to start your very own cryptocurrencyDigital Original\nTerpin, who co-founded an angel group for bitcoin investors called BitAngels in 2013 and a digital currency fund, BitAngels/Dapps Fund, is seeking $200 million in punitive damages and $24 million of compensatory damages from AT&T.Bitcoin became a household name in December, when it reached a high of nearly $20,000.

Swensen, chief investment officer of the Yale University Investments Office.Peter Foley | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nDavid Swensen, who's known as Yale's 'Warren Buffett' because of his investing success with the university's endowment, is making his first big bets on cryptocurrency following the recent swoon in the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies.Swensen, who is chief investment officer of the university's $29.4 billion endowment, has invested in two venture funds dedicated to cryptocurrency, according to people familiar with the matter.Swensen's team invested in Andreessen Horowitz's inaugural $300 million crypto fund, which closed in June, said the sources, who declined to be named because the investment was confidential. It also backed Paradigm, a new blockchain and cryptocurrency-focused fund started by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang, the sources said.\nVIDEO5:1805:18Blockchain Capital's Spencer Bogart says Yale CIO's move into crypto is first step to a new crypto bull marketFast Money\nRepresentatives from Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm and the Yale Investment Office declined to comment.Yale's investments represent a much-needed vote of confidence for an asset class that's been hammered in 2018 following a historic rally last year and has yet to see the support of major endowments and foundations. Bitcoin plunged more than 50 percent this year, while the total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies has plummeted 63 percent, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com.\n if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"dovqG\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"dovqG\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":503,\"200\":444,\"300\":444,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"dovqG\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-dovqG\"),window.datawrapper[\"dovqG\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"dovqG\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"dovqG\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"dovqG\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"dovqG\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"});\nTop names in finance have been skeptical.

There's a herd mentality there as much as there is in retail investing.\"Last year, bitcoin surged more than 1,000 percent to a high of almost $20,000, rewarding miners and enthusiasts. But the market has been beset by news of hacks, regulatory uncertainty and failed projects, and bitcoin's price has dropped back to around $6,500. Some 223 funds dedicated to cryptocurrency popped up in 2017, up from just 23 funds the prior year. As of Sept. 1, there were a total of 389 global cryptocurrency funds, according to the latest data from Autonomous Next.Still, firms like Andreessen Horowitz are focused on long-term investments in the space.Chris Dixon, who runs Andreessen Horowitz's crypto investments along with Katie Haun, told CNBC at the fund's launch that these are  \"all-weather\" bets that they'll make over time regardless of market conditions. Over two to three years, the firm will invest in everything from early-stage coins and tokens to later-stage networks like bitcoin or ethereum and will hold those investments for up to a decade.Andreessen Horowitz was investing in crypto well before the dedicated fund, backing Coinbase in 2013. As of June, the firm said it had not sold any of its investments in crypto.The fund is a sensible entry point for Swensen. Yale has been an investor in the firm's previous funds as part of a portfolio that's included investments in funds run by Benchmark and Greylock Partners.Paradigm is a brand new firm that has not yet announced its existence, but it also has some familiar names for Swensen. Ehrsam comes from Coinbase, and Huang has been working at Sequoia, a firm that's generated healthy returns for Yale.\nThe Swensen effect\nSwensen is widely considered one of the world's top money managers. His approach to institutional investing has been outlined in multiple books and has largely reshaped the way other large endowments are managed.Swensen started at Yale in 1985 when the endowment managed just over $1 billion, according to its alumni magazine, which has also called him Yale's  \"in-house Warren Buffett.\" It's now the second largest endowment, behind Harvard, investing in everything in from venture capital and buyout firms to timber.Yale's endowment returned an annualized 7.4 percent in the past decade and 11.8 percent over 20 years, according to its annual report. The fund gained 12.3 percent from June 2017 through June 2018, the university announced this week. Harvard University, with a $39.2 billion endowment, posted a 10 percent gain.Crypto is a tiny allocation in Swensen's nearly $30 billion portfolio. But if his previous strategies are any indication, it's a good bet that a number of other endowments are poised to follow him.WATCH: There are plenty of gimmicky cryptocurrencies and regulators helping to find the bad players\nVIDEO3:2803:28There are plenty of gimmicky cryptocurrencies and regulators helping to find the bad playersDigital Original\n\n", "birthday": "2018-10-05T11:36:41+0000", "date": "2018-10-05 11:36:41", "year": 2018, "month": 10, "day": 5}

Some even say illegal.As part of an attempt to stop skyrocketing inflation, the country is issuing a new fiat currency called the  \"sovereign bolivar,\" which will be backed by a cryptocurrency. But that cryptocurrency, called the \"petro,\" does not trade, and Venezuela's own parliament says it's being illegally used to mortgage the nation's cash-strapped oil reserves. \"This is a smoke-and-mirrors operation typical of Venezuela \u2014 I'll believe it when I see it,\" said Steve Hanke, professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University and one of the world's leading experts on hyperinflation. \"The problem with the petro is it's a scam, it doesn't even trade.\"In February, President Nicolas Maduro unveiled the oil-backed  \"petro\" digital currency as a means to raise cash amid an economic meltdown and economic sanctions. Maduro said each petro token, which is not in circulation yet, would be backed by a barrel of the state's national petroleum. He also said about 100 million petro tokens would be issued \u2014 estimated to be worth around $6 billion.Crypto rating site ICOindex.com, which rates initial coin offerings, labeled the petro  \"scam status. \" The site evaluates coins based on their white papers, and said while petro promised to be backed up by oil resources, \"the technology and mechanisms to do so are not adequately explained.\" Another site, ICObench, gives it a 1.6 out of 5 stars.There's no evidence backing Maduro's claim on Twitter to have raised $735 million in an initial coin offering. Venezeula's opposition-led parliament called the cryptocurrency's sale  \"unconstitutional\" and a way to illegally mortgage the country's oil reserves.Maduro has said he's aiming to peg wages, prices and pensions to the petro, which he said would equal $60 or 3,600 sovereign bolivars. The end goal, he said, is a single floating exchange rate in the future tied to the digital currency.In March, President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning any transactions within the United States involving any digital currency issued by, for, or on behalf of the government of Venezuela.\nVIDEO4:2104:21Venezuela currency chaos even 'worse than it sounds,' says expertPower Lunch\nVenezuela's banks closed Monday in preparation to release the sovereign bolivar bills, which will have five fewer zeros than the current bolivar currency. The launch of a new fiat currency is at the center of Maduro's strategy to stem hyperinflation, which the International Monetary Fund predicted would jump to 1 million percent by the end of the year. The IMF also forecast an 18 percent shrink in the economy as oil production falls significantly.Hanke, also a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, said essentially all Venezuela is doing is exchanging 100,000 old bolivars for one new bolivar which won't make  \"any difference whatsoever\" toward stopping an inflation rate that has exceeded 40,000 percent. \"They're not changing policy in any way,\" Hanke said. \"All things will revert back to the course they were on before this so-called currency changed.\"On Friday, Maduro announced a 3,000 percent hike in the minimum wage, along with the new currency, that kicks in Monday. Opposition leaders called for a nationwide strike and protest this week in hopes to draw masses into the streets against Maduro's socialist ruling party.The country has been in turmoil since Maduro took office in 2013. Caracas' financial transactions have been crippled by Western sanctions, and citizens are coping with widespread food shortages as their traditional currency collapses.Cryptocurrency uses encryption to verify the transfer of funds, and operates independently of a third party like a central bank. The first and best-known example is bitcoin, which skyrocketed to almost $20,000 last year. Since then, it's lost more than 60 percent of its value, according to data from CoinDesk.\u2014 The Associated Press contributed to this report.\nWATCH: Bitcoin mining can land you in jail in this country\nVIDEO0:0000:00Bitcoin mining can land you in jail in this countryDigital Original\n\n", "birthday": "2018-08-20T15:34:06+0000", "date": "2018-08-20 15:34:06", "year": 2018, "month": 8, "day": 20}

The ETFs plan to track bitcoin futures contracts traded on the Chicago Board of Options Exchange and will trade on NYSE Arca, according to the SEC filing. ProShares declined to comment on the status of its application.\nVIDEO6:1506:15The biggest bitcoin news of the year, says Brian KellyFast Money\nExchange-traded funds track an index or group of assets but trade like stocks. The approval of one could bring in a wave of institutional buyers and, because bitcoin has a fixed supply, theoretically push up prices.Hunter Horsley\u200f, CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, which submitted its own ETF proposal to the SEC in June, said investors shouldn't read into Thursday's deadline. \"An SEC filing hitting a deadline is a procedural reality \u2014 it doesn't change the odds of it getting approved, it just draws our attention to it,\" Horsley said. \"Just because we hit the deadline doesn't necessarily give any indication that the SEC has changed its tune.\"Struggling bitcoin prices jumped ahead of other SEC deadlines for ETFs this summer. The cryptocurrency rallied 20 percent, above $8,000, in late July on rumors that another ETF, proposed by VanEck, would be approved in August. That decision was later postponed by the agency.This week, price moves have been more subtle. The cryptocurrency rose roughly 3 percent to a high of $6,858.61, according to data from CoinDesk. Bitcoin is still down more than 50 percent this year and more than 65 percent from its high near $20,000.Brian Kelly, CEO and founder of BKCM, said investors are getting more cautious and have stopped betting big ahead of these SEC deadlines. \"My view is still [that] this does not get approved tomorrow, but I feel we're making large steps and getting closer to it,\" Kelly said. \"There's a better chance this gets approved than anything else.\"One reason the ProShares ETF might be more appealing to regulators is because it's based on futures trading. The agency has cited the lack of regulation in bitcoin exchanges. But bitcoin futures trade on the SEC-regulated CBOE.\nWinklevoss twins rejected\nVIDEO1:3501:35SEC rejects Winklevoss bitcoin ETF proposal for the second timeClosing Bell\nProShares is hardly the only group looking to list an ETF.In late July, the Securities and Exchange Commission rejected a second attempt by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, founders of crypto exchange Gemini, to list the first-ever cryptocurrency ETF on a regulated exchange. The same week, the SEC delayed deliberations on five other bitcoin ETFs filed by NYSE Arca, Inc. Asset manager Bitwise joined the list of hopefuls in July and filed for an ETF that would track a basket of cryptocurrencies.After the Winklevoss rejection, the agency reiterated its mission to prevent fraudulent or manipulative acts or practices and to protect investors. The agency has repeatedly mentioned the possibility of fraud and manipulation of bitcoin, particularly since this is done in a largely unregulated offshore market.The financial watchdog emphasized in the Winklevoss decision that the disapproval did not rest on whether bitcoin or blockchain technology had value as an innovation, or an investment.SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce was the lone dissenter in the agency's decision on the Winklevoss ETF. She published an open letter that bitcoin bulls saw as a positive sign for an eventual approval. \"More institutional participation would ameliorate many of the Commission's concerns with the bitcoin market that underlie its disapproval order,\" Peirce wrote.  \"I am concerned that the Commission's approach undermines investor protection by precluding greater institutionalization of the bitcoin market.\"\nWATCH: Bitcoin bull vs. bitcoin bear\nVIDEO1:3801:38Bitcoin bounces back: Bull vs. bearFutures Now\n\n", "birthday": "2018-08-22T15:03:44+0000", "date": "2018-08-22 15:03:44", "year": 2018, "month": 8, "day": 22}

It records transactions on a public, distributed ledger and gets rid of the need for a third party in most cases. The technology is touted as faster and more secure by advocates and is being tested for everything from health records to the legal marijuana industry.Among the PwC respondents, who were business executives with technology responsibilities, 45 percent said  \"trust\" could be the key roadblock in blockchain's widespread adoption. \"In reality, companies confront trust issues at nearly every turn,\" PwC said. \"As with any emerging technology, challenges and doubts exist around blockchain's reliability, speed, security and scalability.\"While high profile investors like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon have been publicly wary of investing in cryptocurrency, they're far more bullish on its underlying tech.Companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook are exploring use cases for the technology. Facebook announced in May it is going through a reorganization that will include a new blockchain effort. IBM, Accenture, Deloitte, JP Morgan, and HSBC are among the other corporate names with similar initiatives.Still, respondents mentioned regulatory uncertainty,  \"ability to bring the network together,\" compliance concerns, and intellectual property concerns as key obstacles for blockchain adoption.Blockchain's potential has been compared to the internet but so has its hype.

They will be available to trade on the app starting Tuesday, and ADRs of companies from France will be added in the coming months. It is the biggest addition of securities since the platform launched three years ago. \"We looked at what customers were searching for and not getting,\" Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev told CNBC. \"It allows customers to get some exposure outside of the U.S.\"The company discovered its users wanted access to global stocks by looking at its own search data. Robinhood's staff has access to what people are typing into the app's search and looking to trade. Names such as Nintendo, Adidas, Burberry, BMW and Heineken continued to pop up. The company used similar reasoning in February when it decided to add cryptocurrency trading after users repeatedly searched for  \"bitcoin. \" \"Our strategy has always been listen to the customer and work on building new products to make their lives easier,\" Tenev said.American depositary receipts are stocks of foreign companies that trade and settle in the U.S. market in dollars, allowing investors to avoid having to transact in a foreign currency.Competition in the brokerage industry is heating up with more no-fee options for investors. J.P. Morgan is launching its own commission-fee trading app this week. The banking giant's move intensifies an ongoing price war and move to lower fees in retail brokerage. Shares of Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and E-Trade, online brokers that all charge fees, sank after the news of J.P. Morgan's new app.Tenev said it won't be long until other online brokers are forced to follow J.P. Morgan's lead in abolishing fees altogether. \"Customers are smart.

Robinhood also generates interest income from customer assets, the same way a bank does. And it lends cash and stocks and generates interest off that, a fraction of which Robinhood shares with the customer.J.P.

Much of that total came from retail investors.Financial watchdogs and some cryptocurrency advocates are split on how initial coin offerings should be regulated, and the NASAA investigation was developed as an effort to protect retail investors. \"A strong culture of compliance should be in place before, not after, these products are marketed to investors,\" NASAA President and Alabama Securities Commission Director Joseph P. Borg said in a statement. \"While not every ICO or cryptocurrency-related investment is a fraud, it is important for individuals and firms selling these products to be mindful that they are not doing so in a vacuum; state and provincial laws or regulations may apply, especially securities laws.\"Backers of some ICOs argue that, unlike stocks, certain cryptocurrencies offer a  \"utility\" or future access to a product or service and should therefore be exempt from Securities and Exchange Commission laws.The SEC said in June that while bitcoin and ether are not securities, many ICOs are. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has also made it clear that all ICOs constitute securities, and in a recent CNBC interview said,  \"If it's a security, we're regulating it.\"The SEC launched a fake ICO website called HoweyCoins.com to show investors how to avoid scams.NASAA is the oldest international organization devoted to investor protection. It's a voluntary association composed of 67 states, provinces and territories across the U.S., Mexico and Canada.Since its inception, Operation Cryptosweep has resulted in 46 enforcement actions involving ICOs or cryptocurrency-related products with agencies  \"committing significant regulatory resources\" to the crackdowns, the agency said.NASAA's president highlighted the need for ICOs to register with appropriate agencies, or at least contact regulators to see if they qualify for an exemption. He also warned investors against dealing with ICO promoters who claim their product is exempt from securities registration. \"Do your homework and contact your state or provincial securities regulator with any concerns before parting with your hard-earned money \u2014 afterwards may be too late,\" Borg said.\n", "birthday": "2018-08-28T20:26:50+0000", "date": "2018-08-28 20:26:50", "year": 2018, "month": 8, "day": 28}

It tracks a new index: the Morgan Creek Bitwise Digital Asset Index (MCBDAI).It is just the latest to launch a digital asset fund that allows investors access to an umbrella of digital currencies. Grayscale earlier this year rolled out the Digital Large Cap Fund, also aimed at institutional investors. On its website, Grayscale says the fund lets investors get exposure to digital currencies  \"without the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping digital assets.\"Yusko says bitcoin's downturn has provided institutional investors a  \"more rational way to evaluate cryptocurrencies.\"Yusko is sticking by his bullish call on bitcoin, saying the digital currency will reach $500,000 in the coming years. As of Tuesday morning, it was trading around $7,048.Investors have been waiting for larger firms to dip their toes in cryptocurrency. Security and safety are said to be their main concerns. Morgan Creek said the use of cold storage, where the currencies are stored offline, and third-party custody will alleviate those worries.  \"We want to be the trusted advisor in the digital world,\" Yusko told CNBC.Still, critics say more evidence is needed to confirm whether endowments such as Harvard and Stanford are seriously considering putting money in the digital asset market and are willing to overlook the over 50 percent drop in bitcoin's price this year.Yusko will be on CNBC's  \"Power Lunch \" today.Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the correct spelling of Mark Yusko's name.\nWATCH: Bitcoin skeptics say digital currency has no real value \u2014 Here's why they're wrong\nVIDEO5:5105:51Bitcoin skeptics say digital currency has no real value \u2014 Here's why they're wrongDigital Original\n \n\n", "birthday": "2018-08-28T15:08:13+0000", "date": "2018-08-28 15:08:13", "year": 2018, "month": 8, "day": 28}

The cryptocurrency is still down about 50 percent since the beginning of 2018, and 64 percent from its high in December.After losing the equivalent of $30 million in a June hack, Seoul-based Bithumb was forced by its banking partner Nonghyup Bank to temporarily stop taking new customers. The world's fifth largest exchange reopened account registrations again this week, according to local media outlet Yonhap News and multiple crypto industry news sites. \"All of this buying is coming from Asia,\" said Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM. \"The biggest news in the market right now is that South Korea exchanges are coming back online.\"Bithumb's daily trading volume had dropped to around $72 million at one point in August after the NH Bank news. By Tuesday, its 24-hour volume had recovered to $362 million, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com.South Korea is the fourth largest market for bitcoin despite some tightening by regulators earlier this year. The country's top financial watchdog said in June it would require domestic banks to monitor all exchange accounts in compliance with Korean anti-money laundering laws.South Korea's justice minister said in January that the government was considering a shutdown of cryptocurrency exchanges but got major pushback from retail investors. A petition asking the government to hold back on  \"unreasonable\" regulation got 280,000 signatures following that announcement.\nInstitutional buyers\nNews of institutional interest in crypto has been another barometer for prices this summer.On Tuesday, Morgan Creek Digital and Bitwise Asset Management announced a new fund aimed at investors like endowments, pension funds and family offices. The so-called Digital Asset Index Fund has a minimum $50,000 investment and gives investors exposure to a basket of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin broke above $7,000 following that announcement, after trading in the $6,000 range for the majority of August.Investors have been closely watching the arrival of any institutional money, especially in the form of exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin rallied 20 percent, above $8,000, in late July on rumors that another ETF proposed by VanEck, would be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission in August. That decision was later postponed by the agency.Investors might not see any meaningful ETF news anytime soon, judging by SEC decisions this summer.Last week, the agency disapproved several proposals for what would have been the first-ever bitcoin ETF. The latest of a string of rejections this summer involved two ETFs filed by ProShares that would track bitcoin futures contracts, another from GraniteShares, and five leveraged and inverse ETFs from Direxion.Much like in its rejection of the Winklevoss ETF, the SEC expressed concern about fraud and manipulation in bitcoin markets. But a letter by the SEC's lone dissenter, Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, after that decision gave the market some hope. \"The SEC's willingness to reconsider those decisions, and the positivity surrounding upcoming proposals, presents a favorable environment for market recovery,\" said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency fund of hedge funds BitBull Capital.DiPasquale said the Morgan Creek announcement was a short-term driver, too. But much of bitcoin's recent jump can also be attributed to investors getting more optimistic after seeing prices stabilize despite ETF rejections, he said.Despite the uptick this week, eToro senior market analyst Mati Greenspan warned that this is far from a signal that bitcoin will go  \"from here to the moon by next month.\" \"Big money tends to be cautious, especially while we lack clarity,\" Greenspan said. \"While the bear is gone, the bulls remain hesitant to reveal themselves.\"\n if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"XEsnj\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"XEsnj\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":503,\"200\":444,\"300\":444,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"XEsnj\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-XEsnj\"),window.datawrapper[\"XEsnj\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"XEsnj\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"XEsnj\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"XEsnj\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"XEsnj\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"});\n\n", "birthday": "2018-08-29T18:22:31+0000", "date": "2018-08-29 18:22:31", "year": 2018, "month": 8, "day": 29}

But 2018 has been a different story.The world's second-largest digital asset is down 76 percent this year and can't seem to catch a break. Investor patience is wearing thin \u2014 mainstream adoption isn't here yet, folks can now short the market, and blockchain competitors are gunning to be the top platform for developers.Ether is the name of the cryptocurrency, but it's closely associated with the popular Ethereum blockchain. Unlike bitcoin, which gives access to a global financial network, ether gives you access to a computer network. Its use has been compared to gasoline for a car. Developers can use ether tokens as fuel for certain functions on that blockchain.Tons of initial coin offerings, or ICOs, built their applications on the Ethereum blockchain late last year. Investors saw that as an opportunity. \"When people saw the trends in ICOs as they kept going up, it's easy to understand why people think this could be a long-term store of value,\" said Kyle Chapman, an analyst at venture capital firm Cosimo Ventures. \"That was the appeal for it, and that's why you saw the extreme growth last year.\"Initial coin offerings raised more than $7 billion last year alone, according to data from Autonomous Next. In an ICO, coins or tokens are put up for sale as a form of crowdfunding but instead of voting rights or dividends that come with shares of a company,  \"utility tokens\" promise access to a network, platform or service.But many of those crypto projects have gone belly up, or been outed by regulators as frauds. Even if some projects on Ethereum's blockchain are successful, they haven't been perfected or widely adopted as fast as some investors hoped.Kyle Samani, managing partner at crypto hedge fund Multicoin Capital, said the price drop in ether this year is a reflection of that. \"People started building apps and software, but the market got ahead of itself,\" Samani said. \"They are realizing you have to be in it for the long haul, and some investors don't have the patience.\"\nCompetition\nEthereum certainly has a first-mover advantage, but with that comes the target on its back.Cayman Islands-based start-up EOS, for example, has been billed as the  \"ethereum killer\" and raised $4 billion in its ICO before the product even went live in June. While it had a rocky launch, the project is spending part of that treasure chest to incentivize developers to build applications on its platform, instead of Ethereum. \"Ethereum is facing a massive crisis in investor confidence over its inability to rapidly scale in the face of competition,\" said Eiland Glover, CEO of Kowala, a stable cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. dollar. \"The murkiness of Ethereum's path forward and the lack of DApp mainstream adoption are both hurting ER20 token prices and the market as a whole.\"EOS isn't the only contender: NEO, Cardano, QTUM, Tezos, Ethereum Classic are among the others looking to dethrone the platform.Critics of Ethereum also tend to gripe about its ability to scale and its speed. Current blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, can process between three and 15 transactions per second. Payment process systems such as Visa or Mastercard, in comparison, process tens of thousands of transactions in a second.\nFUD \u2014  \"Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt\"\nIt's an acronym crypto enthusiasts know well and according to some pundits is taking its toll on the price of ether.Whether or not Ethereum is ahead of the pack when it comes to technology, in cryptocurrency prices, perception can be just as important as reality. Buzz around flaws in Ethereum is picking up, according to Matthew Newton, market analyst at eToro, which he said is partially to blame in ether's price drop. \"There is also a lot of FUD being spread around about the death of ether, which may contributing to an emotional sell off,\" Newton said.He added that many ICOs hold ethereum and  \"have watched a fortune dwindle in the last year.\" In order to manage their cash flow and expenses, many have had to sell part if not all of their holdings.Angel Versetti, CEO and co-founder of blockchain-powered network Ambrosus, said despite any shortcomings, Ethereum has been proven to work well compared with other, newer blockchains. The negative narrative might be driven by its competitors. \"There are more stakeholders with concentrated power (or large stake of holdings of coins) among other altcoins, who are promoting a narrative that Ethereum's competitors are better and stronger,\" Versetti said. \"It's important to bear in mind, however, that these predictions are not based on fact, and are merely speculative in nature.\"\nShorting the market\nIn addition to competitors entering the marketplace, Ethereum is also dealing with short-sellers. Earlier this year, peer-to-peer trading platform BitMEX came up with a swap product that allows investors to bet against ether, which former Goldman Sachs analyst Timothy Tam said has dampened prices. \"The reality is it is a lot easier to short ether now, and that contributes to the downward movement,\" said Tam, who is now CEO of crypto market intelligence platform CoinFi. \"Ether has underperformed, but its use case hasn't changed.\"Tam, who has also worked at two Hong Kong-based hedge funds, said market manipulation that regulators have cited as a key concern for bitcoin is also an issue for ethereum. \"We do spot abnormal price movements, and it does seem odd,\" Tam said.\nRelative value\nAlthough bitcoin climbed to almost $20,000 last year, ether would have been the better bet.Bitcoin rose 1,318 percent from Jan. 1 to the end of 2017, according to CoinMarketCap.com. Ethereum\u00a0rose 9,162 percent to more than $756 after starting the year around $8.Both cryptocurrencies have struggled to find footing since. Bitcoin is down 54 percent this year, and has lost $1,000 in the past 48 hours. But ethereum has fared much worse \u2014 it's down 76 percent this year and was trading near $220 Thursday.While some investors have moved on in search of the next ethereum, Tam said these dips could still be a buying opportunity for more patient investors. \"It's a more stable technology \u2014 I think we'll look back on the $200 price and say, 'Wow, that's crazy cheap,'\" Tam said.\n if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"SpzhZ\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"SpzhZ\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":613,\"200\":570,\"300\":527,\"400\":500,\"500\":500,\"700\":500,\"800\":500,\"900\":500,\"1000\":500},window.datawrapper[\"SpzhZ\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-SpzhZ\"),window.datawrapper[\"SpzhZ\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"SpzhZ\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"SpzhZ\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"SpzhZ\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"SpzhZ\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"});\n\n", "birthday": "2018-09-06T18:40:57+0000", "date": "2018-09-06 18:40:57", "year": 2018, "month": 9, "day": 6}

It has the potential to not only disrupt much of finance, but also many other industries.The much-hyped technology has been adopted over the last two years by both start-ups and more established corporations. Mainstream interest in the space picked up last year as cryptocurrency prices soared late in 2017.If job postings are any indication, that trend is going to grow. Recruitment firm Robert Walters said it has seen a 50 percent increase in the number of roles related to blockchain or cryptocurrencies in Asia since 2017, with developers with Python language skills among the most highly sought after.A cursory search for blockchain jobs on LinkedIn yields results for openings at corporations like IBM along with positions at newer businesses, such as cryptocurrency exchange Binance.And there's also strong interest from job seekers: According to data from job search engine Indeed's main Asian markets (Australia, India, Singapore and Malaysia), there's been high interest in blockchain roles.Due to its relative nascency, however, many of those entering the cryptocurrency and blockchain-related space are coming from other industries. \"We hardly ever hire from inside of crypto because most people inside of crypto are very inexperienced. You have very, very few people who are experienced who get into the crypto industry,\" said Julian Hosp, co-founder of Singapore-based crypto wallet and card start-up TenX.In fact, even though there are plenty of blockchain enthusiasts looking to join the industry,  \"not many people have the actual skill sets\" required for developer roles, said John Mullally, director of financial services at Robert Walters in Hong Kong.\nVolatility\nBut as cryptocurrency prices wax and wane, so to have the levels of interest for companies in the space when it comes to recruitment. \"If crypto is doing well, if people are making money in crypto, we get huge inbound from people because they feel like, 'I need to jump on this wave,'\" Hosp told CNBC. \"And then when you see crypto going down \u2014 and we saw this at the very beginning [of this year] and we're seeing this right now \u2014 then we see that immediately the demand of people, they're like, 'Oh no, this is a dying industry, I shouldn't go in there.' So it's completely emotional,\" he said.Indeed data show Asian job seeker interest in bitcoin-related positions peaked as prices of the digital currency rose in the second half of 2017. Bitcoin job interest trended lower after the digital currency came off its record high set last December.Interest in blockchain-related positions, however, has stayed in an uptrend, Indeed data showed.\n\n \"The situation in Asia seems to mirror the U.S. in that bitcoin [job search] trends are much more volatile (and related to price volatility) and resulting media coverage while blockchain and cryptocurrency searches have seen a more consistent upwards trajectory, \" an Indeed spokeswoman said.\nLag effect\nFor other outfits in the developing space, prices of crypto assets have had less of an effect on interest.In the last three to six months, an increasing number of traditional finance professionals have been more interested in looking to make a move into crypto, said Justin Chow, Asia head of business development at Cumberland \u2014 the cryptocurrency division of proprietary trading company DRW.Most of Cumberland's employees come from trading or capital markets backgrounds, with the company saying it viewed hiring at its cryptocurrency arm the same as how it viewed hiring across all asset classes.The lag effect between the present pick-up in interest and the peak in bitcoin prices in December was probably because finance professionals didn't want to immediately drop their entire careers based solely on last year's surge in prices, Chow said.But Cumberland's situation is a little more unique when compared to start-ups operating in the cryptocurrency space, given its ties to an established financial firm. For capital markets professionals, the price of an asset in decline was not a big issue and hadn't deterred interest in those looking to enter the segment, Chow told CNBC.\n \nA similar lag has played out in China, which banned initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency exchanges last year, but is seen to have remained enthusiastic on blockchain technology. \"It's maybe after February, we suddenly see a lot of influx of talent from traditional venture capital funds ... and investment banks in China. It could be said the Asian or the Chinese talent are a little slower than their European or American counterparts to come into this field,\" said Wayne Zhu, a founding partner of NEO Global Capital, the venture capital fund arm of the NEO Foundation. That foundation supports the NEO cryptocurrency, which is one of the top crypto assets by market cap.The driving force for finance professionals in China to take the leap has partly been the capital market environment in the country, where activities such as initial public offerings are strictly regulated. \"It's this predicament of the capital market here that leads to more and more people wanting to try something out in the crypto space,\" Zhu said. \"You have a much harder time trying to close deals and making money in the capital market for the last several years, that caused people to think about, 'Where (can I) actually close deals, (where can I) actually help companies to get money, to get liquidity and the money they need to grow their business?'\" he added.\n'No different' from an internet firm\nOn the whole, those currently entering the sector come from a wider range of professional backgrounds as start-ups develop and mature.Apart from professionals from a tech or financial background, many with experience in marketing, public relations and operations are now also joining the industry.Those who got into the blockchain space last year tended to have either technical or banking-related experience as positions available then were mostly limited to development or trading, said Zhuling Chen, co-founder of smart contract platform Aelf. \"We're looking at distributed applications, so that's where every single entity is expanding into a fully fledged start-up \u2026 so now I see blockchain companies are no different from an internet company or technology company,\" Chen said. \"I think that's also because, right now, blockchain is more than just trading, it's more than cryptocurrency.\"\n", "birthday": "2018-08-31T01:39:00+0000", "date": "2018-08-31 01:39:00", "year": 2018, "month": 8, "day": 31}

But it's never been quite clear just what the bank was planning. \"In response to client interest in digital currencies, we are exploring how best to serve them in this space,\" a Goldman spokeswoman told CNBC in October.The bank's outgoing CEO Lloyd Blankfein tweeted in October that Goldman was  \"still thinking about bitcoin,\" and that the bank was \"not endorsing/rejecting.\"Chavez on Thursday looked to knock down this week's report about the bank dialing back plans, but also make clear that there's never been a timeline for this effort. \"When we talked about exploring digital assets that it was going to be exploration that would be evolving over time,\" Chavez said. \"Maybe someone who was thinking about our activities here got very excited that we would be making markets as principal and physical bitcoin, and as they got into it they realized part of the evolution but its not here yet.\"Goldman Sachs has been clearing bitcoin-linked futures contracts offered by the CBOE and CME since May, and is providing clients liquidity for those futures.As for physical bitcoin, Goldman is not quite there. There needs to be a safe custody solution before the bank can move forward, the bank's CFO said. \"Physical bitcoin is something tremendously interesting, and tremendously challenging,\" he said. \"From the perspective of custody, we don't yet see an institutional-grade custodial solution for bitcoin, we're interested in having that exist and it's a long road.\"Issues with bitcoin's volatility, security, and where to store the actual assets have all been barriers to entry for institutional investors. The possibility of establishments like Goldman entering the market have boosted sentiment, and prices in the past year.Bitcoin has struggled to recover to its high near $20,000 hit in December, and was trading near $6,400 Thursday.

Bitcoin is the first application of the technology, and hundreds of other cryptocurrencies have since emerged. Their prices skyrocketed last year as investors bet blockchain could transform the world as much as the internet did. While major companies and governments \u2014 including China's \u2014 are testing the technology, it has yet to prove itself on a large scale.China used to dominate bitcoin trading, and still accounts for a majority of bitcoin creation through the  \"mining\" process. But increased regulatory scrutiny, especially as bitcoin's price climbed, culminated in the country's central bank and other financial authorities prohibiting sales of new cryptocurrencies through so-called ICOs early last September. Beijing also effectively banned domestic bitcoin-yuan trading.At the same time, Japanese, South Korean and U.S. investors became increasingly interested in bitcoin, which hit an all-time high above $19,000 in December. Chinese blockchain projects sometimes moved their listed headquarters overseas, while development continued within mainland China. Trading among cryptocurrencies is still possible, while bitcoin can be bought with yuan through over-the-counter markets.The persistent speculation has not gone unnoticed.\n\nOn Aug. 24, five government bodies \u2014 the People's Bank of China, the Banking Regulatory Commission, the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Public Security and the State Administration for Market Regulation \u2014 issued a warning about risks from illegal fundraising under the guise of  \"blockchain\" and \"cryptocurrencies.\" The announcement also called out those who used overseas servers while targeting Chinese investors.On the same day, tech giant Tencent announced it will prohibit cryptocurrency-related transactions through WeChat pay, the mobile payments function of its popular Chinese messaging app. Tencent has also blocked some official WeChat accounts that allegedly published information relating to initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency trading that violated government policy on instant messaging services, the company said in a statement to CNBC. Official WeChat accounts share articles and news updates with subscribers for free. Caixin first reported the block on Aug. 22.\nVIDEO4:1904:19What is an ICO?CNBC Explains\nOn Aug. 17, Beijing's Chaoyang District, which includes the central business area, issued a ban on shopping areas, hotels and office buildings hosting promotional events for cryptocurrencies. Chinese news site National Business Daily reported last week that a special economic development zone in the southern city of Guangzhou announced a similar ban.The Chinese government wants to maintain financial stability, and will regulate activity such as soliciting money from ordinary people for investment, according to Jack Lee, managing director at HCM Capital. The company is an investor in many blockchain projects and the private equity arm of Foxconn, best known as Apple's iPhone manufacturer in China.HCM doesn't expect regulators to ease restrictions around cryptocurrency investing even though the government has embraced blockchain technology, Lee said.In a speech in May, Chinese President Xi Jinping called blockchain a  \"breakthrough\" technology. The Communist Party also published in August a book whose title translates roughly as  \"Blockchain \u2014 a reader for cadre leaders.\"Several local governments including that of Hangzhou \u2014 home to tech giant Alibaba \u2014 Shanghai and Nanjing have announced blockchain investments. That makes for a total of about $3.57 billion since 2016, according to estimates published Aug. 28 on news site SupChina by Miryam Amsili, a member of the global development team for Shanghai-based Neo Blockchain and a graduate student at Peking University.Throughout the regulatory changes affecting cryptocurrency, private investment in blockchain remains steady.BlockVC, which counts Beijing among its main offices, is investing in 40 to 50 blockchain-related projects, according to Mingxuan Li, its chief operating officer and co-founder. He said the company's focus is more on underlying technological development.Anecdotally, he said, it's typical for a Chinese person to have one or two friends involved with blockchain and that they will not hesitate to try to convince you to join them. As a result, he said he thinks the development of blockchain will spread rapidly in the country, especially since China's large population offers the opportunity to test applications at scale.Cryptocurrency prices have dropped sharply from their peak late last year and early this year. But they have remained relatively steady despite the flurry of Chinese government announcements, pointed out Feng Jun, who co-founded cryptocurrency news website Hecaijing last year in Beijing. To many, it sounds like more talk than action so far, he said.Bitcoin's price against the dollar lost 9 percent last month and was trading around $7,255 Monday evening New York time, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index.

It's down more than 54 percent this year, and was trading around $6,400 Thursday. The cryptocurrency became a household name as it hit a high near $20,000 on December 16, 2017.If you put $1,000 into bitcoin on that day, you would have lost about $650, with $350 left in it today.\n if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"vrNW7\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"vrNW7\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":506,\"200\":427,\"300\":427,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"vrNW7\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-vrNW7\"),window.datawrapper[\"vrNW7\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"vrNW7\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"vrNW7\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"vrNW7\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"vrNW7\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"});\nEther\nThe world's second largest cryptocurrency has nosedived 70 percent this year, and fell 15 percent this week alone.

The cryptocurrency was born last August out of a  \"fork,\" by a group of developers who were frustrated with some technology issues behind bitcoin, including \"scalability. \" Bitcoin Cash increased the size of the blocks, meaning more transactions could happen per second.If you put $1,000 in bitcoin cash at the high in December, you would have lost $858 by September of this year.\n if(\"undefined\"==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[\"VkNWr\"]={},window.datawrapper[\"VkNWr\"].embedDeltas={\"100\":480,\"200\":427,\"300\":427,\"400\":400,\"500\":400,\"700\":400,\"800\":400,\"900\":400,\"1000\":400},window.datawrapper[\"VkNWr\"].iframe=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-VkNWr\"),window.datawrapper[\"VkNWr\"].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[\"VkNWr\"].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[\"VkNWr\"].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+\"px\",window.addEventListener(\"message\",function(a){if(\"undefined\"!=typeof a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var b in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])if(\"VkNWr\"==b)window.datawrapper[\"VkNWr\"].iframe.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][b]+\"px\"}); \nLitecoin\nLitecoin would have been a great investment if you got in early \u2014 it was up 8,000 percent at one point last year.
